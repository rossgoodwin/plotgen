5-MeO-AMT Trip Report, or, A Week with 5-MeO-AMT and Cocaine



*This story is entirely fictional. I bought a box of Cracker Jacks and looked for the prize inside, which happened to be this strange tale. This is something unusual to find in junk food, so I decided to post it here.*



The order finally came in, after weeks of effort that finally paid off. I picked up the vial of 1000mg 5-Methoxy-N, N-alpha-methyltryptamine about 8:00pm, then came home to play with it. After determining that my friend who has a very accurate scale wasn't answering his phone, I used the 1/2ing method to eyeball a dose (i.e.-1000mg/2 =500mg/2=125mg/2=62.5mg\ldots ..). The report as follows was written while on the drug, due to a mistake which resulted in accidental ingestion of the chemical, and no editing, spelling, or grammar correction has been done.



Friday:



11:20pm - Ingested $\sim$1.0mg in a glass of grapefruit juice.



12:00am - Ingested another $\sim$2.0mg in grapefruit juice.



1:00am - Slight tingling feeling in the body, as well as inhibited balance.



1:30am - Tingling intensified, slight perceptual alterations (like the computer seeming to lag behind my keystrokes,) overall floating feeling, none of the expected nausea.



2:00am - Now I am certain the computer is too slow. I type, but it takes a while for the characters to appear on the screen. This is abnormal, considering I use a relatively high-quality machine. WinAmp Visualizers are wonderful, enhanced colors and flash patterns, blending well with Lords of Acid and Skinny Puppy. I do notice that my mind keeps perfectly in time with the audio and video stimulation, but still has a delay with this damn computer.



2:20am - Amazing body feeling, strong euphoria, a gladness that I tried this instead of going for the coke tonight, it is all here and now. I am cold, so cold\ldots but my house is 74 degrees F. Still no nausea. I was going to type something a few seconds ago, but there is no way I can remember it now. No hallucinations at this point, but light, color, and sound are niticably enhanced. Communication interesting, not difficult, yet there is a lingering in the back of my mind that we are in no way discussing a Quentin Tarantino movie, but really something else entirely. I notice a strange paranoia, but it comes and goes rapidly.



3:00am - I am almost ready for sleep, not because of the drug, but just due to a lack of sleep the past few days. I turn off the music and vizualizer and just lay on my bed, enjoying the feeling.



5:00am - Waking up once in a while, dreams are especially surreal and repetitive. The typing still lags. Nothing is real.



12:00pm - I get out of bed, still with the floating body sensations, and jumpiness. There is a pronounced feeling I can only describe as `melting' going on. The damn computer still seems out of sync with my typing. I am not nearly as intoxicated as I was 9 or 10 hours ago, but the effects are still clearly present. I have a damn headache, hopefully acetomenophen will clear that up. I hear each and every tone and sound in the music, even more of a connection than taking DXM and listening to the Beatles. It is truly amazing for the effects to still be at this degree after 12 hours. 



1:30pm - Effects nearly gone. Father starts bitching about me being high and `grounded.'



2:15pm - I decide to follow the trip with a pile of coke, basically because of the fight with my parents. I tripped to enjoy life, but now I'm doing coke to escape it again. Funny how these things work out, isn't it?



Saturday:



7:00pm - I decide to sleep some, to avoid doing too much blow tonight. I should save it for tomorrow.





Sunday:



9:00pm - Ingest $\sim$4.5mg in a capsule.



10:15pm - Initial Effects becoming apparent, slight tingling and imbalance.



11:00pm - Effect very prominent. Begin playing with WinAmp visualizers to emulate a trip from years ago. Again, interesting light/sound combinations.



11:30pm - Begin watching `Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' DivX on my computer. The image is jumpy, frames are individually distinguishable. Similar to `lag' in typing two nights ago. The typing is just fine tonight. It is curious that I do not miss any audio components of the film, but visually there are chunks missing and pieces repeated, yet when I look closely, the audio/visual feeds fit perfectly. Thus it must be my mind losing/repeating portions of the movie, or the movie is more fucked up than I ever thought possible. (That could be true, it is Hunter S Thompson)



12:00am - Feelings quite intense, with a sense of `gone'-ness. I think a little coke would mix nicely, although it may just be cravings from last night. I cut up a gram and snort a couple small lines. WOW amazing. Still no nausea, except for that induced by coke drip.



12:30am - Heavenly. A +++ by this point. The movie is genius, the scene in a place called the Matrix, where the hippy licking the sleeve of his red woolen shirt and he scare the shit out of the straight guy, is great. The cuts and flashes are part of the film here, although I may have played some role in it. `\ldots strange memories on this nervous night\ldots ..it seems like a lifetime, the kind of peak that never comes again\ldots no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive, in that corner of time in the world\ldots ..whatever it meant\ldots .our energy would simply prevail\ldots we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave\ldots ..and with the right kind of eyes, you can almost see the high watermark, that place where the wave finally broke, and rolled back.'



1:00am - Shaking and vibrating, more because of the coke. I am Flying. A large line\ldots .mind exploding. Lots of teeth rubbing and grinding. Time distortions are now obvious, looking at the clock. 



2:00am - More coke. The movie again. Even more disjointed. Real???



2:45am - Movie off. Everything is so\ldots \ldots shuddering\ldots .intense, still a strong plus three at this point. More coke might help\ldots ..until it is gone. Glow Stick going mad. Going to try for some musical CEVs, after the rest of the powder. no\ldots .have to get out more coke\ldots more than I intended\ldots .it's fucking addictive.



3:00am - Cut off another chunk of coke. put the rest away\ldots .going to snort some now. I feel like a fucking rock star with my powder\ldots  Tripping is VERY intense, and the coke jitters don't help\ldots ..still haven't tried those CEVs. Here we go\ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots almost insane now.  Odd, I think that I haven't felt any nausea from the a, O-DMS. Just from coke drip, and even then only near-vomitous twice.



3:15am - Crazy paranoid visuals\ldots .OEVs are all over. Distortions and warps, not hallucinations. Color has a new meaning. The meaning is paranoid. Taste not like normal coke. too sweet; not numb enough. Maybe I should get someone's opinion that could help determine purity at any level.  Oh well. Now I understand how Kurt Cobain and that Radiohead guy came up with all the ideas for wierd songs and lyrics\ldots .



3:30am - Snort the last little line, NOW I'm going to find some CEVs.



4:15am - Get up to piss, and everything is fake. I am fuzz, the image in the dark mirror grows and seems more demonic than anything else. That image is a reflection of me, the inner demon in me, the piece which we all would like to deny the existence of. The subconcious evil is in me, but now I have a perspective allowing me to deal with it. Wow. My hands and arms leave long tracers, in a strobe-like fashion. The mirror, with the light on, is me, but broken into some sort of block mosaic, falling apart. No more cocaine, the trip is all I can handle right now. A definite +3, possibly a +3.5 on the Shulgin scale. Truly better (or worse? or just different?) than any other drug experiment in my life. I want to live, enjoy life, and have fun. Not destroy my life with evil shit like coke. I crawl back into bed and have more strange sleep, with dreams that I cannot specifically remember, but I know were very repetitive, as if trying to drive some point into my unconcious mind.



6:00am - Wake up for school, still feeling moderate to strong effects. Get shower, try to eat, then decide I cannot drive, so I get a ride from my mother. Strange drive to school, somehow managing to maintain reasonable communicating skills for talking with my mother.



7:45am - In class, I am gone. I somehow get through group projects and oral questioning. I could hear and comprehend, but the information stayed fragmented.



12:00pm - Effects gradually diminishing, I can do work at this point.



4:00pm - It is over. Wow.





Monday:



9:30pm - I decide to give my psyche a rest, no 5-MeO-AMT tonight. I flip a coin to decide whether to snort powder--heads I do and tails I don't--and the first flip is heads. I get out the coke and begin grinding it and cutting lines.



10:45pm - Snort the first small line, thinking if I want more I will do more, but if I don't want more\ldots \ldots I want more. 



11:00pm - A nice long line, my head is spinning. Jumpy, jittery, itchy, paranoid, but I don't get nauseous when it drips tonight. Damn that cocaine.



12:15am - More powder, then some porn.



1:00am - Last line.



1:15am - Searching for crumbs.



1:30am - Decide to just cut off one more line. This will be the last line. Then I'll insufflate some water and saline solution to clear out my nostrils and internal organs.



1:45am - Did the saline and water. I think I can breathe again.



2:00am - GODDAMMIT!!!!! One more fucking line!!



2:30am - Oh hell, I'll go ahead and do all I have out, and save the rocks in the bottle for later. Fuck it. Three more lines and BANG, I'm out. And oh shit, I have school in like five hours\ldots .oh well, fuck it.



2:45am - WHEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!





Tuesday:



10:00pm - Decide to avoid the powder tonight, if I get into it at all I know I won't stop. Ingest $\sim$1.0mg 5-MeO-AMT with interesting dreams resulting all night, but no real trip.





Wednesday:



2:00pm - Ingest an unknown amount of the a, O-DMS, probably around 3mg. 



3:00pm - Already feeling initial effects, slightly detached, intent on creating more abstract art.



4:00pm - The trip is growing, I enjoy relaxing on a couch with air conditioning. 



6:00pm - Try to eat, but food unimportant. It is tasteless, and after every bite I forget that I am eating, so little food is consumed.



8:00pm - I am definitely feeling it, but it is not as intense as I would like. I should take more later. I decided that the coke I have would be great for freebase, so I might do that later.



12:30am - I took $\sim$2.5mg intranasally. I didn't have any ammonia, so no base. I just cut up a rock, put the $\sim$2.5mg a,O-DMS with one line, and railed it.



1:30am - I'm feeling it, much like at the 2-3 hour range with oral administration. I still haven't experienced any real nausea, which is strange, seeing as most users of 5-MeO-AMT describe a nauseous phase, particularly with IS use.



2:00am - Rail the rest of the coke and crack some glowsticks, which are fucking amazing.



3:00am - Amazing CEVs, little motivation to type. I will probably just sit back and enjoy the trip a while.



8:00am - Tripped hard, then went to school, where I continue to trip.





Thursday, 10-9-03:



5:45pm - Ingest $\sim$5mg of 5-MeO-AMT, plan to avoid the cocaine.



6:30pm - The trip is coming on, but I think I am just dead from the lack of sleep the past few days, so I will just pass out on my bed.



7:00am - Wake up, remember bizarre dreams, go to school stil intoxicated.





Analysis:



5-MeO-AMT is a strong drug, which should not be ingested by anyone under any circumstances. My supplier goes as far as to place stickers on the vial reading, `POISON! DO NOT CONSUME!',  `Poison: Do not consume! This Research Chemical has not been tested for toxic content!', and more. If, however, it is consumed, it provides a very interesting experience, unlike anything else, capable of producing strong +++ experiences, and it has the potential for bringing about a true ++++ experience. I think I'll insufflate $\sim$4mg tonight.



*Now isn't that a weird story for a box of Cracker Jacks?*
