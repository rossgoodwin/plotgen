So, where to start. I had been an avid pot-smoker for about two years. After smoking for that long, pot was just not cutting it for me. My Dad had recently got me interested with the 60's and 70's love era. He gave me a book about the hippie movement called `Electric Acid Koolaid Test' by Tom Wolfe. The book was about Ken Keasey and the merry pranksters experimenting with acid and reaching a new level of consciousness. The concept of `higher consciousness' is what first got me interested with psychedelics. The idea of a deeper understanding of my surroundings intrigued me. After reading that book I really wanted to try acid, but I thought I would try something a little less intense to start out with (although I now hear mushrooms can be just as intense). 



My friend bought three eighths. My parents were gone for one week so we decided to try them in that time frame. We had made plans to try them a certain day. When that day rolled around I found out I had to work at eight o'clock the next morning. To be honest, I was feeling somewhat tentative about trying them. My friend, I'll call him D, had never done them before. The third party member, I'll name E, was my sister and she had certainly never done them before. So I was feeling a little unsure as to whether I was truly ready, after all, I had heard a lot of scary things about this drug before. Some people I know said they had felt like they were dying at one point during their mushroom trip. My nerves would have been eased a little if I had been able to do them with someone with experience in psychedelics. 



But what the hell, my parents were gone and I wasn't doing anything besides playing halo 2 on xbox live. My group was waiting for me to make the decision. I could tell that their status was a iffy as well because they weren't trying to pressure me into trying them. When I gave my party the okay, they were a little surprised, but we proceeded. We took the shrooms with water and they didn't taste that bad to me. I just chewed and promptly swallowed my eighth. D, followed, then E ate hers after him. It was 9 p.m. Just a little background info on D, we grew up together, so I knew he would make this a comfortable experience.



I had actually never researched the effects of magic mushrooms, I just went by the limited information I got from people I knew, so I didn't know exactly what to expect. The book I mentioned earlier would actually help my trip significantly, as it stressed the importance of group unity. 



Ten minutes passed and I wasn't feeling much. I went back to playing halo. I hadn't smoked any weed that night so that I would be able to realize the full effects of the mushrooms. I played for about half an hour. I was feeling really good during those thirty minutes. I was yelling and screaming at my opponents and just having a blast. Once I started tripping out on a falling box, I decided it was time to go outside with my fellow shroom mates. As I stood up, I could feel myself clearly feeling different. It was hard to take at first and I had to sit down. I took a minute to gather myself. Then I got back up and walked around a little bit to get used to this almost out-of-body feeling. The sensation was weird, it was like my mind was the only thing I had, and my body was just a tool for my brain. Strange, I know, but that is how I felt. Next, I proceeded to put on some long rubber boots and a straw hat, which I dubbed the `safari hat'. My buddies got a good laugh from that one.



At this point I was feeling extremely happy and\ldots well\ldots just great. I live in a rural and secluded area. My sister, and D, and I decided to go for a walk down our long gravel driveway. We walked very slowly, unsure as to what we were getting into. We paused sporadically to check out our surroundings and reflect on how our experience was going. At one point we stopped and rested against my neighbor's fence. I remember saying `I don't know, this is just weird\ldots I like it a lot because I can talk fluidly, this is really great\ldots but it's just weird'. Weird indeed, that is the only way I can describe it. It's a whole different consciousness. 



We walked further down the road and I noticed that the white rocks in my gravel driveway were glowing in the darkness. We were being really loud and obnoxious, but no one seemed to care. The group was feeling really positive and we were feeding off each other's positive vibes. One person would say something random, then the next person would elaborate with something even more bizarre. Even during this social chaos, we all seemed to know exactly what the other was talking about\ldots we were flowing. The most ordinary things looks amazing. For example, there were trees in front of my neighbor's house with a porch light on in the background. The light seemed to pour out of the breaks between branch and background. It was surreal. D remarked that it looked like a giant jack-o'-lantern. We all laughed at that. 



Suddenly, one of my friends pulled into our driveway. As he neared closer I stuck out my thumb like a hitchhiker. He must've thought it strange, but he rolled down his window. D and E started railing questions at him. I shushed them and told them to let me be the ambassador.  I asked him where he was going. He said down the road so I asked him if I could hitch a ride. I was about to get in the car when all of a sudden I felt uncomfortable with the situation. This buddy of mine, another friend of almost 15 years, seemed like an alien to me. I just couldn't relate to him in his normal state of mind. I quickly declined the ride and walked off with D as my sister took the ride. 



At this point things got a little hard to remember so I will state the things that stood out most during my experience. D and I went back to my house. I remember that my mind kept straying, almost to somewhere depressing. Like the feeling I get rarely, but get nonetheless, that nothing at all matters. I shouldn't really say it's depressing, it's more of an entirely distinct and unique feeling all it's own. Whenever this feeling occurred I would seek comfort from D. He was having a good trip, so I tried to feed off of his positive energy. Whenever I did this, it worked, and it brought me back to a happier place.  



We got back to the house and I remember seeing my newly arrived friend and my brother, who both hadn't taken shrooms, smoking weed on the back porch. They handed me the pipe. I felt very strange holding the piece to my mouth and almost couldn't figure out how to use it. I felt like I was some Neanderthal trying to use some primitive tool for the first time. After one hit, I was done with smoking. I walked over to a swing and looked out of the lake, which my house is located in front of. It was beautiful, but I couldn't help but feel somewhat alarmed. I felt alone, completely alone. I felt like I was the only person who existed in the universe. I felt like I was going somewhere negative, so I headed over to my posse for moral support. 



I told them that I liked their energy and that our group was doing well and to keep it up. My sister started dancing. I looked at her strangely, and then she stopped. She had been drinking prior to shroom consumption. She said, `I just feel like dancing!' I looked at her for a couple seconds. I was still feeling negative and trying to think of something that would keep me from going somewhere bad. Suddenly, I got it. I replied, `then let's dance!' We then proceeded to dance like a couple of people who were out of their minds. There was no music; we were dancing to our own tune. 



This made me feel tons better. We stopped and looked over the lake. The sky, previously dark with clouds, began to clear up. The stars appeared. The clouds looked like something from the weather channel when it shows the forecast for the day because they were moving very rapidly and swirling around unpredictably. Then the stars began to move around. I could actually see UFO's flying around in the sky with the stars. I could see distant nebulas and far off galaxies. I was feeling extremely good and couldn't stop saying how awesome it the sky was looking for me. 



Once that sensation died down, the entire lake suddenly got really bright for me. The entire area for about 3 miles just lit up. This was extremely strange because it was the middle of the night. I studied the lake intently, and discovered that there was a rainbow extending from one end of the lake to the other. Both E, and D saw this, so I'm guessing it was actually there. The sight was beautiful. I felt connected to all of my surroundings and to D and E. This is where my trip peaked.



Coming down was fun. D and I often got into reflective discussions concerning our trips. After much deliberation, we came to our original conclusion. `This is weird'.



Overall, my experience with magic mushrooms was extremely enjoyable. I recommend that everyone try it. It changed the way I think about the world. There's a lot of negative stigma hovering around this drug because of the potential of having bad trips and also because it is considered a `hard drug'. This is very unfortunate because I think everyone could benefit from the effects of magic mushrooms. I know I loved it and I look forward to my next mushroom trip, as well as my first acid trip.
