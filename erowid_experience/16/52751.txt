Purpose:

I am doing DMT because it is a psychadelic. I am interested in the psychadelic experience because humans, as well as all animals, experience their universe through their brains. It is our consciousness, our memories, our senses, it is everything that is us, it is our universe. To alter ones consciousness, is to gain some freedom from the habitual thoughts, beliefs, feelings, senses etc. of normal consciousness. That freedom allows room for other perspectives, and provides a way to learn about ourselfs, and our universe. 



Dose:

Preperations of root bark can have a strong dose as low as 5g. I will drink a tea made from 5g of Mimosa Hostilis. 3g of Syrian Rue seems to work well for many. I will spread the dose of rue out over time, because I think that may be part the reason why trips sometimes end somewhat quickly. The MAOI runs low in the body and DMT is metabolized, thus ending trip? Especially when the DMT dose is low. The DMT wouldn't take much MAO to metabolize it. Hopefully a continual dose of rue over a 1.5 hours will keep the somewhat small dose of DMT active for longer. 



This dose didn't produce any effects from DMT, although there was strong mood enhancement from the MAOI. An increased dose of DMT is neccesary. I will reduce brew X2, and drink same volume thus a dose of approximately 9g. I will take five gel caps of rue $\sim$3-5 g, and they will be spread over time again. 



The above dose, which the following report is about, produced a light and pleasant experience which hinted at its power as medicine, and therapy. I will increase the dosage by \%25 for a stronger experience. I will reduce volume again so that a dose would be equal to less than one half cup, because that volume was too much last time.  I will repeat this in a few weeks when I am prepared. 



Preperation: 

56g of mimosa hostilis rootbark, and six 1000mg Vitamin C pills was ground in a blender until it is mostly grit and dust with small chunks and small coarse strips of bark. I add the mixture to a pot of $\sim$10 cups of water, and boil for 50 minutes. I place lid over pot and let sit over night in room temperature. The next morning I add more water and boil for another hour. I covered the pot and let it sit in room temperature until I got home that night, and i blended the mixture in a blender. I boiled it for one more hour, then let it cool and filtered it through a t-shirt. This brew sat in a wine bottle for one week in the refridgerator, and a layer of fine clay-like sediment formed, and I decanted the liquid off of the top, resulting in a burgundy colored liquid that had no suspended sediment. I ground syrian rue in coffee grinder until it was powder then filled gel caps. 



Trip:

I live in South Africa and moved here from the US six months ago. I live on a large property with many trees. This day was sunny, cloudless, and round 60 F. 



At 9:40am I take three Syrian Rue gel-caps. At 10:25 I drink brew and take another rue gel-cap. I gag and almost lose my stomachs contents. I take an additional 2 gel-caps in 30 minutes. For the next hour I lie on a couch listening to music, and observing the trees of my back yard blowing roughly in the wind. Today the winds were gusty, and around 25 mph. The trees were surging in the wind like rough water. I noticed the mood brightening of the MAOIs, and music was very pleasant. After about fifteen minutes I began to feel nausea. For this trip I choose to accept the nausea, because if I were to chose a remedy it would be pot, and I wanted acute sensitivity to any changes I feel from the DMT brew. For the first hour and a half after taking the brew I went through waves of nausea ranging from none, to coming close to purging. 



My friend/sitter and I discussed a bike ride down my street to a view of a bay with an undisturbed natural tree line across the water. At this point it had been an hour and a half since drinking the brew, and two hours since first dosing on MAOIs with no DMT effects, but a fair amount of nausea. I couldn't ride bikes with that level of nausea, so I smoke a small amount of pot, and I ate a small bowl of oatmeal with a banana. Both of these helped to settle my stomach over the next $\sim$45 minutes. The effects of MAOIs is a pleasant mood enhancement that is potentiated by pot. My friend played guitar, and I lied down to combat nausea. The nausea was pronounced while sitting and standing, and subdued while lying on my back. I feel good enough for a bike ride now, and I get up to walk into the room where he is playing guitar. As I walk there I notice the first effects of DMT which was the brightness in my vision. Over the next few minutes it became apparent that something else was begining to happen. We stepped outside and to a bright, sunny, visually stunnning day, and get on our bikes. On the way there, over the course of about 3 minutes, the visual effects began to include seeing patterns in things around me such as the shimmering of leaves, or the stones in the asphalt we rode over. 



We got off our bikes and walked down to the water. That day the water was rough as well due to the wind. The patterns in the waves of the bay jump out at me, the body buzz of the DMT is becoming apparent, and sound is enhanced. I hear much more clearly, and when i speak it sounds loud and incisive, and did not sound as though it came out of me. I began to see tracers. The power of it has increased a great deal over the past few minutes, I wasn't expecting this much power after only 10 minutes of feeling the very first effects. I tell my friend we should go home. I had taken a dose of $\sim$9g of mhrb, and knew that could potentially produce a powerful trip, and a public dock was not the place I wanted to be when I discovered I had little motor control a half mile from my home. The ride home was a splendid daydream on a beautiful day. 



When we get back I tell my friend I'd like to be alone and I go into my back yard. I get one of our chairs in the yard and move it to a sunny location. I sit back in the chair, and am absorbed in the swaying of the trees in front of me. When I blurred my eyes a bit colors swirl like van gogh's the starry night. Patterns emerge from everywhere around me. Thoughts are free, and wandering. I slip into periods of external absorbtion, leaving myself behind. I sat there for about 30 minutes and realized I had peaked, and there was going to be no serious power today.  I walk back inside to tell my friend that I am having a pleasant, mild trip, and have no nausea. I let him know this, so that he understands I am in no overwhelmed position mentally (strong trip), or physically (nausea), and that I am in a good condition do something such as a bike ride or a walk. He is cooking himself some pasta and a pasta sauce. He sits down to eat a few minutes after I come in. I sit with him a few minutes, and realize I should not waste this. Although this is no powerful trip, the freedom of thought in light psychadelic experiences can be helpful, and therapeutic. I decide to do something I have been pondering all day. 



I Have a tree house in my yard. It is about 25 feet off of the ground in a large egg-shaped sugar maple. It is a platform with no walls, or roof. It is 4'X8', and I have a seat built beneath it for rainy days I feel like enjoying it. I enjoy it most when the wind blows, and starry nights, in the winter when there are no leaves. Today this tree was swaying a lot, but I am a very able climber and I was in control of my body, and had no hesitation about climbing today. I climbed up and layed in a hammock I made that is suspended above the platform. It is a powerful feeling to sway around in a hammock connected to the tree, moving with the wind 25 feet above the earth. The hammock hangs only a few inches off of the platform, and while swaying the bottom of the hammock would drop on to the platform, and slide my bottom sideways accross it. I was very absorbed in the swaying and visual experience. I moved in and out of periods of external absorbtion. I am taken back to a moment I had a few months ago, and reminded of that experience.  I look around at the branches and leaves swaying, and shimmering, and I have no thoughts in my head. 



I realize there are no words to place on the things around me, as there are infinite words to place on the things around me. It is one thing to realize that symbolic thought, or words are confining the things one thinks about to those words, and another to experience this. I lay in the hammock in awe. It is a feeling of rapture. This is what I have been missing, this is what I have been ignoring, and I see again.
