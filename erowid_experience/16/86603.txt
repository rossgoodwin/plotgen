Well\ldots I suppose I'll begin by saying that words are never truly enough for me to describe the profound world of psychedelia, as it must be experienced to appreciate it's infinite beauty. Also, the inability to fully recall every detail of psychedelic experiences seems to be one of the main factors in keeping each of my trip's novelty. 



A little about myself\ldotsI'm 20, male, 6'2' \& 160lbs, I eat organically as much as possible \& avoid things like fast food, HFCS, high sodium, trans fat, artificial ingredients \& preservatives, and refined/processed foods in general. (Who can resist a little Inn-n-Out once in a while though..) I truly despise the way fast food has taken hold of America (and much of the world) and is slowly poisoning the people. What could possibly be in a hamburger you're paying \$1 for? But anyway, that's a bit of a tangent. My previous experiences with drugs include:



- Cannabis [Daily user for a year or so]



- Alcohol



- Magic Mushrooms [also MM + MDMA]



- LSD [also LSD+MDMA]



- Nitrous



- LSA



- Tobacco



- 2c-i



- Methylphenidate



- Salvia



- DXM



- MDMA



- DMT



- Diphenhydramine



- Codeine, Hydrocodone, Oxycodone



- one prior experience with piperazines (from the same pills as the ones taken in this report). 



Although I'm not 100\% sure of what was in the pills, I made an educated guess from what I read/heard/felt. I find nothing other than the description of BZP/TFMPP seems to fit my experience (although piperazine usage among humans seems to be quite limited, at least in comparison to more popular substances like cannabis or mushrooms). I'm also a daily walker and stay away from the dead ends (Heroin, Methamphetamine, Cocaine). I find walking to be one of the most pleasure inducing, relaxing, and healthy activities known to me. The warmth of endorphins \& sitting down on the couch and smoking a bowl after a long walk is second to none. Anyways, on to the fun..



Set: Excited. We'd been looking forward to having a mind-melting trip for a while now, and tonight was sure to please. My girlfriend and I have much natural chemistry, and this goes a long way in making the trip more enjoyable.



Setting: Just my girlfriend and I in our house. Very open style architecture \& colorful, creative painting \& decoration. Lots of room for our minds to expand in. Also accompanying us is our Pug.



[I think it's also worth mentioning that I'm recalling all this from yesterday, no notes or anything.]



6:30 PM - We (girlfriend and I) started by orally dosing 1/2 a pill each of piperzines. Both of us hadn't eaten for 3hrs+, although fruit was consumed shortly after eating the pill. Piperazines seem to be an intense thermogenic, so I feel it's a good idea to provide a source of energy other than your body's stores. 



7:30 PM - By now we are both feeling that there is something different from everyday reality. Light sensitivity is quite prominent; looking outside lights seem to jump out with incredible intensity, while everything else is more of a background. The sky is a little cloudy, and the sun is close to setting. The sky is such a beautiful piece of our everyday. I'm feeling quite stimulated, rapid heartbeat \& a euphoric feeling in my muscles is clear now. My girlfriend was very enthusiastic in conversation, quite energetic. Pupil dilation is already at a shroom-like level. We've also taken Vitamin C pills containing a variety of other antioxidants (ALA, L-Glutathione, Prickly Pear Extract, Grape Seed Extract, N-Acetyl-Cysteine) along with a drink containing 5-HTP, Eleuthuro, Ginkgo, L-Theanine, Acetly-L-Carnitine, L-Phenylaline, Rhodalia Rosea, Chamomile, and B Vitamins. 



8:20 PM - We were now very much in the realm of piperazines. Euphoria all over, talkativeness, much more accepting of everything around me. Things that might normally bug me (the dog chewing on himself endlessly..) would now instead make me think, `Well, he's just doing what makes him satisfied. Just being an animal. Why would I make him stop?' Jaw clenching has begun, along with a general cold feeling. I weighed out 10g fresh home-grown cubensis (Golden Teachers) for my lady friend and 15g for myself. I had stored them in the refrigerator in the high-humidity drawer for a couple days prior to ingestion, so I'm not sure how much weight was really affected (it didn't seem to be much different). We chewed them up with a wee-bit of organic PB and looked forward to visiting the hippie-esque world of Magic Mushrooms. Smoking marijuana is quite pleasurable (as always) and adds a warm and subtle cushioning to the whole experience. 



9:00 PM - We both began to rapidly ascend as if in a psychedelic catapult. The normal anxious come up associated with the fungus seemed to have been completely skipped; while social interaction and talking, etc. was all still quite smooth, visuals presented themselves \& started becoming exponentially more intense. The visual feel was much more of the all-over/stroby look of LSD as opposed to the more area-focused/distorting sensations offered by psilocin. My muscles felt as if they were large orbs filled to brim with colorful energy, yet completely contained; like a thick sharpie outline on a colored drawing. Animals are weird on psychedelics\ldotsthey're alive, but you can't get their opinion on anything. What do they think about all this? Do they think? I ate another banana at this point as well. My girlfriend exclaims that she couldn't believe she was sitting on the same couch as an hour ago. 



10:00 PM - My girlfriend had disappeared somewhere else in the house for an interminable amount of time, while I remember sitting on the couch with eyes closed listening to Boards of Canada, Animal Collective, \& Shpongle. One of the most notable differences from a pure psilocybin trip is the profound mental clarity. One idea/thought seems to ZOOM into the psyche as it is warped around and toyed with by the colorful CEV's, then as soon as the thought has been completed, it ZOOMS out, promptly ushering in the next. I get an image of the alien with multiple arms sorting mail on Men in Black II for some reason. Looking at the patterned carpet at my feet, it seemed as if the carpet was miles and miles away, as if the space between the carpet and I was the Grand Canyon, or the long ravine on the Death Star. Music is simply bliss, and if there is a such thing as nirvana then the Star Shpongled Banner helped carry me there.



The light bulb next to me ended up being the most fantastic part of my trip. Just staring at it for a minute made me first think how beautiful the light itself appeared to me, then on to pondering about what light really IS anyway. I recall how beautifully the idea of perceiving light \& the world around me was laid out for me at that point. I was thinking how interesting it is that the light is really just a sort of stimulation, and when it enters our eye the brain fires out chemicals saying `Hey! This spot in the world is really bright!!' Things appeared much more to me in a dreamy way, making it easier for me to imagine that although I am perceiving the world this way, it's really just my own personal translation of what things `are'. I'm having one of the best trips of my life.



11:30 PM - Both of us are coming back down from outer space now, regaining our egos a little bit. I remember being surprised how smooth the transition into shroomland and back out again had been. We talked about the possibility of the shroom trip being sort of\ldotsfast-forwarded. We had both experienced the familiar ego-death and deep psychological changes that psilocybin initiates, yet here we were talking about the trip like it had happened hours ago, when normally at this point (about 3hr mark after shroom ingestion) we would still be waist-deep in the trip.



The more prominent effects at this point for me was the feeling of a certain system in my body being `turned on' so to speak, the same adrenal-awakening feeling that I associate with LSD. I felt like I'd been brought up to be on the same level of tactile awareness as my dog. Every single movement, every slight disturbance was intently obvious. I perpetually had the feeling that I get during free-fall, like my stomach is coming up into my throat\ldotsbut in quite a euphoric way. I recall nystagmus being pretty intense at this point as well, as the weird visual oddity of the piperazines overtook the mystical-style visuals of the `shrooms.



The muscle relaxant properties of the psilocin helped calm down the jaw clenching a little throughout the trip, but it still came and went. We'd both taken magnesium prior to ingesting the pills to help as well. Another drink containing the afore-mentioned 5-HTP, etc. is consumed. I also remember feeling extremely tingly on my entire epidermis. My girlfriend running her fingers up \& down my arm was orgasmically enjoyable. In fact, any kind of tactile input caused little bursts of giddiness to jump out of me. It felt like her touching my skin was sent to my brain and translated as a laugh or a smile, which promptly came out. The main negative side-effect for me was the feeling of `I'm about to get a headache' that never fully develops into a headache. Rightly so though, after that intense voyage..



2:00 AM - We're beginning to feel the grasp of sleep slowly encompassing our psychedelia-worn muscles, my eyelids no longer feel like they're spring loaded, almost bouncing back open. We chatted about how incredibly enjoyable \& novel the experience was, and that we'd definitely had our thirst for venture into the other-world quenched. My skin still feels subtly electric \& lovely. We invite one more round of THC molecules into our craniums and call it a night. Oh, making out ranks up there with the likes of MDMA ;) 



10:00 AM - Getting out of bed was slightly more difficult than usual, but once I did, a bright mood and sense of relaxation \& well being was obvious. After eating a bit and smoking some fine California herb, I came here to share this with you all. The same headachy feeling comes \& goes, but is mostly absent. I have a pretty ravenous appetite, not sure if it's from the marijuana or the piperazines, or both. Either way, I love chocolate. I absolutely plan on exploring this and other piperazine/psychedelic combinations in the future.
