In the past 2 weeks I had decided to purchase a bottle of 72 150 mg Kava Kava (standardised potentcy 30\%) from the drug store. My decision came after having waited many months for some time and source for marijuana or mushrooms. Unfortunately, an excellent oppurtunity had just gone by and I was having no luck on getting a hallucinogen of any sort!



It was time to try SOMETHING at least, so I decided on the stress releif claimed on the side of the Kava Kava bottle. That afternoon, I took the regular dose, 2 pills (100 mg calculating in the 30\% Kavalactones).



I kept stepping up the dose until about 800 mg of Kavalactone, when after 10 minutes I felt like I was covered in a nice blanket, and most profound was the simplicity of the world and not worrying about a few annoying problems I've been haivng lately.



The next week I decided to take 750 mg(15 pills). I swallowed them and lay on the couch\ldots I got to thinking and decided to finish off the bottle which brought me to 35 pills (1750 mg).



I layed down on the couch and the warm blanket feel came about. My mind was purged of any stressful or depressing thoughts as I was just very content.



30 minutes afetr ingestion I noticed the world started to spin, as if I had been spinning around in a circle for several minutes. It was very dizzy, and my balance was poor but I didn't feel at all sick. I was quite happy and walked around laughing as I sort of half fell while I walked.



I fell asleep on the couch 30 minutes later and woke up after about 2 hours. I got up and I was no longer very dizzy, but I was still quite happy about nothing.



Unfortunately, the toxicity of the dose was apparent as I became ill-feeling into the 3rd hour. I was driven home and fought to keep myself from vomiting on the car.  I walked up to the bathroom and held myself over the sink and vomited quite hard. With nothing in my stomach, it was worsened by the enormous pressure on my forehead.



Kava Kava pills taste bad and as far as I've seen in my experiences, I have to take about 700 mg to feel anything at all. The pharmaceutical companies also standardise the potentcy and most likely leave the herb hanging around a warehouse for long periods of time. I wouldn't bother with Kava again unless it was very fresh. The bottled pills don't really do what they claim unless I take a lot more than I'm supposed to.
