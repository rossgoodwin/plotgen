Somebody I don't believe I know scribbled this in my notebook. I found it today and decided to transcribe it for your entertainment. It is humorous, frank, and full of folly. Some might say unpleasant.



Subject: 25 y/o male. Extensive use of LSD and mushrooms during teenage years. A handful of experiences with AMT and 5-MeO-DMT. Has abstained from psychedelics for five years, aside from a single pleasant and inconsequential experience with 2CI almost two years ago. Something about pretending to grow up.



At around 8:00 PM, I dissolved 15mgs of 2CE into about 3oz vodka and chased it with a glass of Emergen-C. Based on my readings of 2CE trip reports, I anticipated a long wait for the onset. I decided to stay busy and prepare things. I straightened up my bedroom, went to a nearby gas station for cigarettes, came back and showered. I'm slightly anal about feeling clean when I take certain kinds of chemicals. It's just something I wanted to have out of the way before the fun began. 



By the time I was done drying my hair, my stomach was feeling anxious, and I was clenching my jaw a bit. I got dressed and started picking out music. Truthfully, I did this without any regard for being on psychedelics. I've always had a bit of a chip on my shoulder in regard to listening to music on drugs. I can't remember what I was listening to at first. I decided to lay down for a bit. I began to feel the effects more, and nothing was very comfortable. We were experiencing the worst of a recent cold wave and I got up to adjust the heat a couple of times. I had always enjoyed the feeling of cold weather and being bundled up while on these kinds of substances, but not in this case. The combination of anxiety, chills, and speedy initial effects weren't really fun.



It then occurred to me that the best thing I could do was resign myself to toilet worship for a moment. I've never taken advice on fasting before doing this sort of thing very seriously. I had a light dinner of salad earlier and resolved that I'd rather not look at it partially digested in this state, so I kept the light off. I then threw up for what seemed like a relatively short period of time, emptying myself almost completely. Lesson learned. 



I felt a little closer to baseline after this. After all, what grounds you to the physical plane like vomiting? I then brushed my teeth and used mouthwash, and sat down in my favorite chair to smoke a small bat of sweet, outdoor-grown marijuana. I hadn't planned on smoking during the onset, but I decided it was a prudent choice to exchange being a little stoned for any residual nausea. I took a few hits and felt considerably better. By this time, the house had warmed up a bit. I still felt slightly irritable, however. I decided to listen to my favorite metal bands, Gorguts. I know a lot of people would run from technical death metal in this context, but it felt so right. For about an hour and a half, I listened to Gorguts and Suffocation, all while knowing how ridiculously inappropriate it was. I was experiencing amphetamine-like effects at this point, with superb aural enhancement and occasional LSD cliche visuals - breathing curtains, liquid walls, etc. I was giggly about this, but it was also kinda, eh whatever. At one point I got up and sent a friend of mine (who doesn't listen to much metal) a Suffocation song through AIM. When I told another friend how I was occupying myself, his response was simply, `Jesus Christ.'



I felt it was time to shut off my computer and relax a bit. I put on a record by Kayo Dot and got under my blanket. I'd enjoyed this record a lot lately and thought it would be appropriate, but the 2CE disagreed. I was enjoying some closed-eye visuals, but the epic dynamics just didn't impress me. After about twenty minutes, I shut it off. Something else felt wrong, and I realized I had to empty my bowels.



Let's just say it was physical humbling part two, and again, I will never do this sort of thing again without a fast. It occurred to me then that I was strangely comfortable with thoughts I would normally push aside during a psychedelic experience. I sat in the dark, putting together ideas about human wastefulness, the filthiness of babies, the arrogance of growing old, and shitting as our most reliable function as animals. There was a tone of acceptance and humor to this, however, and I giggled a bit at how I can retain a bit of lazy misanthropy and appreciation for absurdity without allowing it to consume me.



After I was certain I was finished, I got cleaned up and sat in a corner of my bedroom, and packed up a bowl. I was now about 3.5 hours in. I reflected on my bad habits and poor lifestyle choices as an adult. Mistakes I've made, people I miss, and dreams I squandered crossed my mind, but it wasn't agonizing. `You aren't clever just because you get away with everything.' It's strange to say that I felt fairly good at this point. And I recognized that it probably had something to do with the ways in which I HAVE managed to overturn bad attitudes and irrational thinking. I know there are things I have to change, and change comes in baby steps, but I am entirely capable of seeing it through. 



I'd had enough of this introspection and decided to watch a film. I chose the magnificent `Fando y Lis' by Alexander Jodorowsky. I can't really put into words how this film visually came alive to me, even in the high-contrast black and white. I laid in bed and got sucked into the intense surreal drama, having several laughing fits along the way. All I can say is, do yourself a favor and see this film. If you're sober, give it every bit of your attention. If you are going to watch it on drugs, I hope you have a strong stomach. There were themes expressed here that fit into the vibe I'd felt all along, but again, there was a strange optimism, too.



After it was over, I was tired but still feeling speedy, so I smoked another bowl and managed to sleep for a few hours. I had a few lorazepam and ultrams set aside, but didn't feel like I needed them. I woke up early, feeling slightly strange, but okay.



I hadn't planned on writing a trip report, as it's not really my style, so I apologize for not offering more details on time. I did not keep a log and did my best to ignore the clock. It's hard to give a qualitative analysis of an experience like this. Some people will probably avoid 2C-E after reading this, and they probably should. As some other reports have stated, it brings to the surface things one might not be comfortable with. Use common sense in determining if this would be something beneficial for you. I have another dose, and I will have to echo the sentiments of Dr. Shulgin and many people reporting on this substance: it's not fun, but I'm certain I'm going to do it again.
