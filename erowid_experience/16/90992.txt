Substance:



4-FA fluffy white powder, bought from two vendors who both claim 99\% purity, product appears identical from both vendors and seems to be from the same batch. Primary dose from one vendor, redoses from the other vendor.



Supplements:



Piracetam



Mood:



Sleep-deprived and anxious about being very behind on a project that is past deadline



Purpose:



Testing my limits with 4-FA, seeing how it works starting my day with 3 hours of sleep and with multiple redoses in comparison to caffeine. I'm loving this drug and recommending it to people so I wanted to test my limits and make sure I'm not being too arbitrary in my endorsement.



Administration:



Weighed out doses on milligram scale. Mixed with fruit juice and gulped down shotglass style. Practically no taste. Kicks in fast enough that snorting or other ROA seem unnecessary and uninteresting.



Trip Report:



I pushed myself to the limits yesterday to see what would happen\ldots 



The night before I went to bed around 12:30am and then woke up around 4am and instead of going back to sleep like I usually do I dosed 120mg of 4-FA and 1.6g Piracetam. I ate a decent healthy breakfast and even though it started kicking in right away I was able to complete my meal.



For some reason at least in the first two hours every song I played sounded like it did the first time I took MDMA \ldots  basically really really good. No rushing though unlike MDMA or Mephedrone.



Anyway it was super early in the morning so I had no distractions or interruptions like I usually do. I was able to sit down and work on my project for about 6 hours straight. Then I started feeling weird and realized I needed to eat something so I had a small snack. I then was able to work for about two more hours really effectively.



Considering I can usually only get like two hours work done in a day I was happy to have gotten eight hours done in a short period of time.



Anyway at this point I was super hungry all of the sudden, and it seemed like effects were wearing off. I ate a big meal and dosed 2.4g piracetam and 35mg of 4-FA. I tried to work but found myself incredibly extroverted and needing to socialize in a bad way, so I spent a couple hours socializing. Then the 3 hours of sleep caught up to me and as energetic as I was I felt exhausted. I guess the original dose was wearing off and because of the big meal it was taking awhile for the redose to kick in. So I forced myself to nap even though I was really amped up.



I had some weird effects from the nap, the nap itself was very tossing and turning and the dreams were super weird and made no sense. I slept for about two hours and when I woke up I had anxious rushing. The 4-fa redose kicking in mid nap definitely triggered an adrenaline release.



My heart was beating faster than usual like it would if I had just gotten in a car accident or something. I was hallucinating in an odd way and having various psychedelic thoughts that reminded me of a LSD comedown. It wasn't a lot of fun, I had to sit down and just calmly meditate with my eyes open and try to calm down the thoughts as I was worried about psychosis.



I felt like I was being flooded with adrenaline the way I do if I'm in the middle of a deep dream and then am woken up suddenly. Suffice it to say it was a bad idea to nap when I had just redosed on top of a big meal and it hadn't metabolized yet, I put myself into a sleep-deprived adrenaline-interrupted waking dream state.



Anyway I meditated for like 45 min to an hour or so and the adrenaline wore off. Then it's like all the effects of 4-FA came back and I went back to work for a few hours. I felt compelled to redose another 25mg as I was feeling good but wanted to feel more like the original 120mg dose. I took another 1.6g of piracetam as well.



When the second redose hit I realized I had gotten like 14 hours of work done on my project and just didn't feel like working on it. Instead I did the sorts of things I do on a recreational mephedrone trip. Primarily listen to music, dance, and socialize. I felt *extremely* extroverted and was having multiple text and instant messaging and IRC chats going on all at once. It was the opposite of my usual introverted state. I was posting lots of pics on facebook and that sort of thing.



At the same time I did still feel the effects of sleep deprivation. I was tired and could tell I was artificially energetic. And although earlier in the day the extroversion from the first redose made it super easy to talk on the phone, the second redose made it easy to text chat but I had a really hard time with verbal communication. I just seemed unable to pay attention to what someone was saying to me vocally, and told the person I was talking to that he needed to text me because I was zoned out.



Anyway I realized that on the second redose I did not eat at all and that blood sugar crash hit somewhere at the same time as the 4-fa started wearing off. When it wore off I was dead tired and hungry, so I snacked on a couple things, popped a 5-htp and went to sleep right on the dot of midnight.



I slept for 7.5 hours and felt like I was dreaming the entire time, I had weird dreams, and was tossing and turning in my sleep apparently since my sheets came completely untucked. Usually after sleep deprivation the previous night and working my butt off and socializing I'd still be kind of tired and want to sleep another cycle but this morning I just feel awake and refreshed. No hangover whatsoever, no compulsive need to grab the cup of coffee or energy drink to get going like I do when I'm taking equivalent amounts of caffeine for similar drug-binge sleep-deprived work sessions.



I've long said that I prefer mephedrone to caffeine, but the truth is that mephedrone is too euphoric and too scattered IME to take the place of caffeine when it comes to certain things like overcoming sleep deprivation to finish something when a deadline is looming. 4-FA gives energy drinks a run for their money, honestly, I really do think it would make the world's best energy drink if someone were able to make that happen. For the amount of equivalent stimulation 4-FA has almost no side effects compared to similar caffeine and energy drink stimulation.



The main issues I see are sleep deprivation and blood sugar. No matter what stim I take sleep deprivation will catch up with me, I can cheat sleep for the short term but I'll feel it. The appetite oppression is somewhat too good on 4-FA to where I forget to eat. This is especially true if I'm up for 30 hours or whatever, and remember eating several meals already. The sense of time is kind of off, it is probably a good idea to get a timer to go off every 4 hours to remember to eat. I don't know if its just me but when I haven't eaten in 6 or 7 hours I start feeling like crap, and it is easy to blame on the drug when in fact it was just not paying attention to eating patterns (which I guess is somewhat the drug's fault for killing appetite).



The nice thing though about the appetite suppressant is that I don't feel opposed to eating, it is not difficult to eat like it is on other appetite suppressing drugs. Healthy food actually feels and tastes healthy and there is no compulsion to overeat. I think this could be used for dieting if one can set timers to remember to eat. I can easily eat small meals throughout the day which is the best way to get high metabolism. But the double edged sword is that it is super easy to forget to eat, and the time wonkiness makes it seem like I already ate recently but it could have very well been four hours since the last meal, and only feel like an hour from a memory perspective.



Anyway I am still very impressed by this drug. It is not flawless, but I feel like it has far more benefits than negatives and that all negatives can be compensated for. It honestly seems safer than caffeine, and certainly doesn't have the physical addiction and withdrawal issues that caffeine does. It took some time to get used to the 4-fa comedown because it reminded me of caffeine comedown and I kept expecting to get migraines and wake up the next day needing coffee to function, but those issues haven't ever come.



I am completely sober today and feel well-rested and as if I did no drugs yesterday. I feel calm and peaceful and in a good mood. If instead I had binged yesterday on coffee or energy drinks I'd feel drained and anxious and depressed and like I needed a fix. I do still feel extroverted, which is new for me since my whole life I have been pretty introverted.



Conclusion:



4-FA is still a winner, it is like taking most of the positives of caffeine and mephedrone and almost no negatives. Equally good as a `study aid' and a social/party drug. Not as euphoric as mephedrone, headspace is similar to mdma afterglow, no `rushing'.



Pros:



Tons of clean energy. Short-lived subtle enjoyable euphoria for first 1/5 to 1/4 of trip. Easy to focus on a specific task, completely gets rid of ADD/OCD. No jitters, no compulsions to obsessively redose, no pupil dilation, no vasoconstriction. Music sounds wonderful like it does on MDMA. Easy to socialize, turns me into an extrovert even though I'm naturally shy/introverted. No compulsion to divulge secrets or profess love to random people. No hangover. Residual anti-depressant and anti-shyness effects. Lasts a long time.



Neutral:



Appetite suppression. Can be good or bad depending on how you look at it.



Cons:



While focus is easy it still takes discipline to stick to the task at hand. Anxiety goes away so it is harder to feel the need to focus on a project I'm supposed to do rather than on something fun. However it makes working on a project enjoyable instead of dreadful. Time gets wonky so it is easy to forget to eat or to think you've only spent an hour on something and realize it was four. It over comes sleep deprivation but doesn't cure it. I can become too focused on something trivial when there is something non-trivial of higher importance. Increased heart rate although less than most other stims. Crashy if I'm sleep deprived or have forgotten to eat, although sleep and/or food gets rid of the crash.
