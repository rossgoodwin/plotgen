Dose: 5 mg (exactingly weighed out), intravenously injected



Other drugs taken: 1 Soma at 2:45 am [T+5h], and 40 mg ketamine IM at 4:30 am [T+7h]



Experience: One prior experience with 2C-t-7 (25 mg orally) and many experiences with other drugs/psychedelics.



Setting: Hanging out in a dorm room (and around campus) with a couple of close friends.



Duration: onset -- immediate, plateau - 3 hours, comedown -- 6.5 hours



9:30 pm

As I injected the contents of the syringe, my friends watched in amazement as my pupils dilated (from small to complete saucers) over the course of a few seconds. I *felt* the drug beginning to take effect as I was injecting the solution.  The solution *burned* in my veins (and I have injected many things) and I felt like my veins were unhappy about being subjected to such a chemical. After I finished, I was completely and suddenly overwhelmed and tripping harder (physically, and visual-wise) than I ever have in my entire life. I  have taken high doses of acid and shrooms before, but nothing could have prepared me for the intensity of my reaction to IV 2C-T-7.



I layed back on my bed and there is no way that I could  have walked around or moved or functioned normally in my current state. My body high/load/buzz was more intense than anything I have ever known, and negatively so. It would be like the worst research chemical body load  (muscle tension etc) you could imagine combined with an intense MDMA body high.



Right after injection I could hear time warp as the music slowed down (almost  ketamine-like), but a few seconds later it sped up again, and indeed I would say that for most of the trip time is sped up rather than slowed down.



I thought to myself `damn I realize why people don't IV this shit' and I realized that the dose was way too high (and that I should have done more like 3 mg). At the same time, however, I was having the most intense and amazing visuals I have ever had. I have had intense trips with both acid and shrooms and never did I have more than breathing, and then only on acid at a very high dose, and only for about 15 min while I was peaking. The most visual trip I had had prior to the current experience was also on 2-ct-7 (25 mg orally), which was a relatively nice mild trip, but with good visual qualities (colours looked prettier, lots of breathing, and tracers -- the only drug I've ever had tracers on).



My visuals were so intense that I could not see straight. I saw rainbow swirling patterns (many swirling rainbow spirals all connected across my frame of vision) and colours were vivid.  I was seeing closed eye visuals superimposed over what I was seeing with my eyes open. There were visuals that seemed like they were coming from behind my eye, like flashes of light. At points I felt like there were eyes everywhere both watching me and seeing for me (note: this was not scary but rather quite wondeful).  My eyes were wide open and I don't think I could have closed them if I had wanted to. I could see fractals superimposed over my field of vision -- truly astounding. Everything was vibrating rapidly,  like breathing that is tweaking really damn hard. My body felt like it was vibrating to the same rapid frequency.  I have never seen such beauty and miraculous visual distortions.



I was extremely nauseous (almost immediately after injection), and had horrible tension throughout my digestive tract. I had been thinking that injecting the 2C-T-7 would reduce the nausea but I am wrong! I have never thrown up from any drug (except alcohol) and IV 2-ct-7 made me vomit profusely until I was dry heaving. 



Despite the unpleasant overwhelming physical effects, my mind was surprisingly clear.  Though my body felt somewhat poisoned, I was not experiencing any `mindfuck' (as I typically do on acid and shrooms at higher doses). I was definintley in awe of the amazing visuals, and I felt a little giggly, but only very slightly confused.



10:00 pm

I was still tripping really hard, although I can say without a doubt that I peaked immediately upon injection, and that I was just still plateauing at this point.



I was getting amazing synethaesia, unlike anything I could ever imagine. I was feeling music, smelling colours, and seeing sounds\ldots  I felt like a ball of undifferentiated sensation. It is definitely a unique and very enjoyable experience and I was totally in awe and gushing to my friends\ldots 



12:30 am

Right around now my nausea/stomach tension had subsided enough (though it is still present) to where I could sit up and drink small amounts of water without feeling like I have to dry heave.



I was still tripping very intensely and the visuals continued to be strong. I was still unhappy with the body tension (esp. like a tight/burning feeling in my arms) but I felt like it has calmed down a bit by this point, so that I no longer felt anxious and poisoned.



2:30 am

I had started to come down at this point but I  still felt somewhat disoriented and I had to be careful/focused to walk around safely (due to my intense visuals -- though not nearly as intense as earlier). The body load was still quite heavy but not so much that I felt nauseous walking around. My friends convinced me that walking around would be good so we went outside.



We walked on a path that goes around a lake and I was amazed by how beautiful my natural surroundings were.  It's almost like I was in a fantasy world (kinda like something out of Lord of the Rings), and because it was so dark, it seemed like everything is coloured in shades of purple, orange, and green, lending a very trippy feel to the world. I felt an almost childlike wonder and the lights and stars are  beautiful and glowing and hypercolourful.



We continued walking around for a good hour, which was fun though I was extremely cold (as I always am on the phenethylamines). Colours continued to look amazing but I was definitely becoming more and more sober by the minute.



2:45 am

My body tension was still bad, although I felt like I was barely still tripping at this point, and most of the cool (visual etc) effects of the trip had disappeared. I decided to take a soma and I  felt it begin to kick in about 20 minutes later. Unfortunately it only reduced my body discomfort slightly, but I decided that I didnt want to take more (to keep my experience relatively pure).



4:30 am

My friends and I decided to IM some ketamine. I was mostly down at this point though I was still getting some visual effects if I focused really intently. I IMed 40 mg ketamine and I appreciated its numbing effect on my body and physicaly sensations. At one point, the high (combined 2ct7 and K euphoria) was quite pleasantly intense. 



Despite the fact that I routinely IM 40 mg and hole quite thoroughly, I did NOT hole this time. It is as if even the dissociation of ketamine was not enough to override the intense physical presence brought on by the 2-ct-7. The k-trip did seem more visual and less slowed down sound wise (sounds sounded almost normal), and it was defintely much less introspective. I talked periodically with my friends throughout the trip, which does not usually happen for me at this dose of k. It was  an interesting combination though I find myself wishing I had done more. The k did not make my stomach discomfort worse.



6:00 am

I was totally down, except for a persistant unpleasant feeling in my body and in particular my arms. Also my arm that I shot the t-7 into iwas particularily unhappy, although there were no physical signs of distress (the injection site looked absolutely fine, in fact it's even hard to find).



10:45 am

I ate some food (I was quite hungry) and I was completely sober but still had a persisting yucky feeling in my body as well as the nasty tension in my arms, and in my one arm especially as I mentioned above. 



Summary:

I have mixed feelings about my experience. On the one hand, I do not regret the trip, as I had the most amazing visuals ever, and I doubt I will ever experience anything like that ever again. I was also ok physically,  I did not die, and I appear to be completely normal (2 days later), so I doubt that the trip will have long-lasting effects on me.



On the other hand, the trip was quite uncomfortable at times, and damn unpleasant for the most intense parts of the trip.  There was definitely a price to pay for the visuals I saw.



I don't think I would do this again, and if I could redo the experience, I would take a lower dose, $\sim$3 mg. This drug is EXTREMELY POTENT!
