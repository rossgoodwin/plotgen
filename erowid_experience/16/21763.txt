Saturday, and I'm bored. My girlfriend goes `Let's go to Diane's house, she said she'll get us high.' We go, they do the last of the meth, and we pass around a bong. Since they did all the meth, Diane offered me some of her pills. She had some haldol and some seroquel. Being familiar with the haldol, I opted for some of those. After the haldol hit, I was a little buzzed, but in no means fucked up, so I asked for one of the Seroquel in addition. At the time, I remembered that I also had an Adderall XR 20mg in the car. I took one 200mg Seroquel, and as I was beginning to feel it, I took the adderall.



Then the trouble started. My girlfriend told me I looked incredibly fucked up and asked if I was having fun. Diane remarked that I didnt look like I was having fun at all, which I wasn't. I felt intensely sick as the Adderall started to kick in. I jumped up to go to the bathroom, but I didn't make it. As I started walking, my heart started pounding really hard and fast, and a sharp pain winced in my left arm. I fell to the floor. I started to freak out, and discussed going to the hospital, but decided against it. I decided just to try to sleep it off in that spot, as I wasn't fit to move at all. Whenever I tried to move, the tachychardia would start back up. As I drifted off to sleep, I got some intense closed eye imagery, which I don't remember too clearly now. The most intense images were of papers coming out of a printing press, one by one, tuned to the beat off music that was playing in the background. I seemed very sensitive to sounds around me.



Six hours later, I wake up in my bed at home. It seems I decided I was well enough to walk again, and my girlfriend drove me home, though I don't remember it too well. I wake up to her saying that she's going to a rave, and will be back later. I told her I thought I was better and would be able to go. There, I pay \$15 and get in the door, and immediately feel very sleepy. I go to one of the booths in the back and go to sleep. I spend all of the show nodding in and out of sleep, there was a wasted \$15. Two people asked if I was alright, I told them I was just tired and had to get up early for work the next day.



After the show, we went to another friend's house and a couple hits of weed out of her bowl smoothed out the bad elements of the buzz very well and turned it into a nice sleepy high. I went home, went to sleep, and that's pretty much the end of it. It's monday now, and I still don't feel quite right. I feel very anxious and nervous, and my heartrate is slightly elevated. I just looked up Seroquel and found out it was an antipsychotic, which I never would have taken if I knew what it was. I guess the moral is not to take random pills even if your friends tell you they are great stuff. And that antipsychotics are no fun at all.
