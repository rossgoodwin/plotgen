Background: I am quite an experienced drug user and have a good tolerance to most substances I have experimented with. Mephedrone came to my attention as an MDMA substitute, and with a big party approaching I decided to purchase a gram from an online chemical supplier. However, the package did not arrive on time, and so I purchased 2 g from a friend.



At 9 pm I took a dab of left over MDMA before heading out to a party, and spend the first hour of the experience enjoying a typical MDMA trip. During this time I had a few beers, and when I could feel the rush of the MDMA wearing off I decided to open the bag of Mephedrone.



I racked up a few small lines (perhaps 25 - 50 mg, better safe than sorry, eh?) for myself and some friends and we snorted them. It stings a bit, and leaves you with a funny taste at the back of the throat and a runny nose, but then this is not unusual when one is used to inhaling various white powders. It is also a bit sticky, requiring items that have come into contact with it to be licked clean and nostrils to be checked in mirrors.



A few minutes after doing the first line, the effects began. The rush is similar to coke, but instead of spouting self-important gibberish, the conversation was involved and empathetic. For the next few hours, we did a few more lines every now and then, and chatted. There was a lot of hugging and kissing, and even difficult topics of conversation were easy to broach.



This substance is extremely moreish, and a peculiar effect seems to be the desire to share the experience with as many people as possible. I was dishing out bumps left right and centre, and taking a hit with every round. However, despite its moreish nature, it was relatively easy to control the urge to do huge amounts. Little and often appears to work well with this one. After a few hours the lines were abandoned in favour of bumps off keys or bombs.



Around 2 am I began to feel nauseous. I had been drinking cider, and hadn't eaten since lunchtime, so I suspect this was due to the combination of these two factors. I threw up a few times but then I felt immediately better. However, the lovely warm vibe of earlier in the evening had transformed into the gritty feeling of having done perhaps a little bit too much. Nonetheless, I continued redosing perhaps every 30 minutes, and as before, conversations and actions seemed to flow effortlessly.



At 4 am I began to feel very tired and like I had had enough. At the start of the evening I had 2 g, and there was still a little bit left, which I gave to my friends, so I guess I had consumed around 1 g throughout the evening. I took a taxi back, still feeling wired and chatty.



On arriving home I chilled with my boyfriend for about an hour and we smoked a few spliffs. He remarked that I was obviously wired (dilated pupils, chatty) but that I was being very cute and didn't seems as messy as I felt I was. I suspect that at this point, the MDMA comedown was kicking in, but the weed put a mellow spin on things which was very pleasant. After the first few tokes, I felt echoes of the initial rush - whether MDMA or Mephedrone I'm not sure - but after a while I began feeling relaxed and sleepy. We cuddled and went to bed, and I soon slept.



The next day I had no trouble waking up, even after only 6 hours sleep. I had heard varying reports of people experiencing either no comedown at all, or a terrible comedown similar to that from MDMA. I felt mine was somewhere in the middle, and that perhaps the negative feelings were mainly due to the MDMA I had taken, along with the lack of sleep. It certainly felt like I had partied hard the night before, but I felt sociable and proactive, although sofas, beds and blankets also featured heavily that day.



By Monday, I had fully recovered and the package had arrived. The contents appeared more crystalline than those I had procured at the weekend, and so I decided to try a little for comparison. I must admit at this point, that I had been hankering after some more already, and while I suffer from a particularly fiendish attitude towards drugs (i.e. if I they're there, I'll have them all) I suspect that Mephedrone can be, psychologically at least, very addictive.



At 4 pm I dropped a small bomb, but being impatient, I also did a small bump off my keys. The total dose was probably around 50 mg. I wasn't expecting much, since the two experiences were so close together, but almost immediately I felt the stimulant effects. I rushed around erratically, gathering my coat and bag and getting ready to go and see some friends. I did another little bump on my way out of the door.



On the walk, I was listening to music. Like MDMA, Methedrone makes music sound AWESOME! I can only describe it as sounding louder, and more surrounding, and I became aware of every individual beat, almost as if it had been slowed down just a touch. By the end of the 30 min walk however, the lovely effects had again worn off leaving the feeling of having just drunk a very strong cup of coffee. It's now 7 pm and I feel like I have returned to baseline.



Overall, I highly rate this drug. It's cheap, fun and legal (here\ldots  you should probably check its legality in your own country). I would describe the overall effect as a mellower combination of MDMA and coke or speed, a lovely chatty drug that keeps me up without messing me around too much. I strongly suspect that this will become my drug of choice, at least for a while.
