The night started off like most of my Saturday nights, that is to say I had little hope of doing anything and had resigned myself to a night of relaxation and bliss. At the time, however, I had no idea how true my prediction would be.



Enter the Soma. I had taken three 350 mg. pills, I can't remember if my stomach was full or not, but that has not had an effect that I have noticed either way, so onward we go. Fast forward a short time, my friend, who I will refer to as A-man, calls me and let's me know that a little get-together is going down at his sister's place. Now, normally I probably would have turned him down and just enjoyed my buzz, but Soma makes my judgment a bit different from normal, so I said `Hell Yeah'. There are two more guys, F and R, though neither have much bearing on the story. So all four of us head to the store to get some party favors, namely beer and brandy. And then we arrive at the destination, junk mail scattered, empty chip bags strewn about\ldots .my kind of place.



And the night starts. I crack open a beer which was just delicious, find a home for the rest in the fridge and find a nice comfy spot to chill in, I think this is going to be a good night. Some time was spent playing video games, I had a great time playing Contra (the old-school version) on the X-box 360, but more importantly, the perfect synergy of Soma and beer is starting to take hold.



So, let's skip ahead a bit more shall we? The people who actually live here arrive, one smashed out of his mind, the other, A-man's sister, seemingly sober. The sister and I talk a bit, time starts to lose meaning to me, and the final piece of the puzzle enters. Just some random guy, but he has the key to my night: marijuana. I'm not a big pot head, I smoke once every few months maybe, but that night seemed to be the perfect time. So we play the pass around game myself, F, and a new guy, J. Now this is where things get really interesting for me.



I don't even remember what was going on around me, my only recollection is searching for a bag of tortilla chips that went missing quite suddenly. Well, I gave up my search and took a seat, as it seemed the chips were hopelessly gone. But, luckily for me, the chips didn't matter anymore, as I had completed a holy trinity of substances. The soma relaxed me and the alcohol heightened the effect, but the introduction of marijuana sent me into outer-space. My body began to feel as though it were made of a soft yet inflexible rubber. I had trouble moving my arms, though I found that if I tried hard enough I could overcome this hurdle. For the rest of the night, I don't think I had a single thought in my head, I just reveled in sheer harmony and bliss, enjoying the ride before the inevitable came. And come it did, I shortly felt myself fading slowly into a deep oblivion. But this was like nothing else I've experienced before, I felt each and every level I passed between the waking world and where I was headed, and like everything else, I didn't fight it I just went along for the ride.



I awoke early the next morning after a mere 4 hours of sleep feeling more relaxed than I had felt for the longest time. This combination is definitely a winner for me.
