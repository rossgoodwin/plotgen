I had been debating trying coke for a long time with a close friend of mine when the chance finally arose. My friend was getting some mushrooms for a small get together at a friends house but didn't have enough for me and another one of our friends. So I came up with the solution of buying a teenager for the two of us.



When we got to the house I showed my friend the coke, and he was excited after he tasted it smiling and telling me how good this coke was. I wouldn't have known since this was my first time but I was happy. He began chopping the lines for me and him as three of my other friends began eating their shrooms. We started by dipping our cigarettes in the pile and lighting the coke on the end. Finally took the first line and it was my turn. I wasn't really nervous until I knelt down and suddenly my heart began to race. I just took a deep breath, blew it out, and snorted the line at about 10 PM.



Within minutes I felt amazing. I don't think the expression I felt like a million bucks comes even close to how I felt. Everything was great. I felt as if there were no problems, nothing to be stressed about, and the world was perfect. Complete euphoria. At some point along the way I developed the habit of drumming my fingers and hands on my legs which never stopped until about 12 hours later and if it did, I felt really akward and became squirmish. My friends were all laughing at me and I talked to another of my friends who had only smoked marijuana with us beforehand and the only thing I could talk about was how coke was amazing. I remember telling him numorous times to try coke and play the drums (he is a drummer) because he would be able to go for hours and hours. He told me that he wanted to have a Zombie fight, and I declared that in a zombie fight I would be invincible and all the zombie's were going back to hell.



Throughout the night I kept taking more lines when I saw my friend taking one. Eventually a friend of his came over who I had never met before. I was sitting on the couch talking to him and my friend asked if his friend could have some. So throughout the night I gave him a descent amount of coke because for some reason I felt a connection and I liked him and I wanted him to be as happy as I was at the time. I really wanted everybody to be as happy as I was because I felt so amazing that I wanted to share that feeling with everybody and I felt that coke was my medium to make everybody feel great. Unfortunately by that time everybody else was on tripping on shrooms and we didn't know if shrooms and coke was an ok combination.



After a while my friend's apartment got so smokey and I got really hot and sweaty from my heart rate and constant motion that I went outside with my friends friends who I had given the coke to, for a cigarette and to chill off. At the time I was feeling paranoid because I felt like I was being annoying to my friends because they didn't seem to want to talk to me. I later found out this was just because they were all on shrooms and I looked fucked up to them because I was tall and jumping around and full of energy and they were hallucinating. But my new friend told me to let loose and have fun. He told me to start drumming because he had noticed that I loved to. So I drummed on the table rather loudly forgetting that it was 2 am and after a short while my friends from inside yelled at me to shut up because I was being loud. We both laughed and went inside.



I went inside and my new friend showed us this performance to an Offspring song he did by swinging a little blinking multi-colored light on a string. So we turned out the lights and watched and of course to a bunch of people on coke and shrooms it looked fascinating to say the least. After the song he gave me the light and said I could play with it. I was too jittery and moving so fast that it didn't really work so I just gave it back.



Throughout the whole night I had smoked a pack and a half of cigarettes (which usually would make my lungs stop functioning) but my lungs still felt great. I told everybody that I wanted to run 300 miles and I felt like I could run around the earth and I would come back and not be tired at all.



I was slowly getting used to how the back of my throat, mouth, sinus's, and nostrils were all numb but I couldn't quite get used to that feeling. After a while I began playing tetris with another friend. I was playing amazingly, I figure because I had so much energy and everything felt like it was on hyper-drive that I could also process things much faster and more accurately than when I was sober. Eventually we switched to mario brothers and then my friend went to the bathroom. By this time it was nearing 6 AM and I was still unable to stop moving and my thoughts were racing. But anyway, while my friend was in the bathroom I heard a loud screech and a car crash outside. About 15 minutes later I asked my friend because I didn't even think to look at first and we both looked outside and saw a bunch of sirens and stuff. Since he had to go home soon we decided it was better that he sit tight for a while. We sat around and played Mario and Tetris for a while and then he eventually said the shrooms had worn off so he was going home.



It was after he left that I began to come down. Since all my friends were sleeping and I didn't want to wake them up I just sat in a corner and tried to sleep but the only way I could physically stay still was if I concentrated on it very hard. But then I would eventually start shaking again. I was so physically exhausted but yet still full of energy that I kept wishing the coke would leave my body because the insomnia was driving me insane and I really really really just wanted to be able to sleep.



I felt really lonely because I wanted to talk to somebody really bad too but all of my friends were sleeping. So I came up with the idea to embrace the silence. But this didn't work because photo's, walls, and posters don't make very good conversation and eventually I felt more depressed because I realized I was trying to make friends with inanimate objects. At about 10 oclock I was finally able to sit still without focusing on it. I still felt really `zooted.' I came to the conclusion that at this point I probably just became so physically exhausted that it didn't matter anymore.



At about 11 AM my friends woke up and we went to wendy's to get something to eat. It was at the point that I asked my friend if it was normal that I still felt really `zooted' and he said no. So I got really paranoid that something was wrong but he told me that I did alot for my first time. We got our food and went back to the apartment but I realized I couldn't eat anything because it hurt my mouth to eat for some reason and I wasn't hungry at all.



The whole day I felt really out of it. I don't know if that was from missing a whole nights sleep or because of the coke. I also wanted to do it again. Which scared me. So I decided I would wait a couple weeks to collect my thoughts before I road the white pony again. That night I drove 7 or 8 hours with my friends family to go skiing and I still had a drip in the back of my nose from the coke and I didn't want to blow my nose profusely or snort it back up alot either because my friends mom is a prosecutor and their dad is a doctor and I didn't know what they would do if they found out about it. Plus I was still extremely paranoid. So I suffered and eventually when we got to our hotel I shared a laugh with my friend about how well I was going to sleep tonight and passed out on the bed.



The only thing I regret about the whole situation is not taking it slowly. I felt like everything negative that happened that night could have easily been avoided if I hadn't done so much. I also contributed the fact that I couldn't sleep at all no matter how hard I tried to why the come down sucked. I figured if I hadn't done so much and had taken it slow my first time, I would have gotten an ok nights sleep and felt alot better the next day. My friend told me that his come down was pretty good and he wasn't depressed at all and the only variable was he went to bed that night. However given the opportunity, I would definently do it again\ldots  and again.
