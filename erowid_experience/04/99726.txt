Background details:

This was my second time taking psychedelics. My previous experience with drugs is taking MDMA a few times months ago and 4-HO-MET once, again months ago. My experience with MDMA didn't border on unusual and my experience with 4-HO-MET which I've reported on and was a +3 on the shulgin scale. I'd read up on 4-HO-DiPT which my friend and I were initially planning to do and also started reading up on 4-HO-MiPT since we also had acquired some of that. Because we both agreed the DiPT looked to have a short effect and the MiPT lasted considerably longer and had significantly different effects we decided to do both. From my experiences with MET I knew my tolerance was already slightly higher than that of the average ``researcher'' so I decided to join my friend, who is more experienced than me with psychedelics, to take 20mg of each substance orally in powder form as a bomb. Ie putting 20mg of 4-HO-DiPT and 20mg of 4-HO-MiPT into a single bomb and drinking with water.



I had not eaten since about 1am the previous night after which I went to sleep and didn't wake until 11am so was fully awake and ready for a strong length experience. Didn't smoke anything, eat anything or consume alcohol at any point during before or after trip. 



Situation/Drug details:

Sat in my friends room where he lives but his landlord/relatives were out. Small room with a massive double bed taking up most of it and his PC on one end of the room. Most time was spent lying on the bed with music blasting from his PC. Both substances could be described as fluffy off white powder. 



Outcomes/Experiences:

2pm Take 40mg (total) bomb with water



2.15pm Slight nausea probably just letting us know that it's orally active.



2.20pm onwards all sense of time is lost until about 7pm, what follows is an amazingly intense experience. I was with an experienced researcher in a safe environment and we had taken many precautions and things still could have gone quite wrong as you will see. Enjoy this story because in retrospect it was hilarious but at times I began to sketch out. As this story continues time is almost irrelevant, at times we looked at the clock and what seemed like an hour had been less than a minute and sometimes minutes were over half an hour. 



Started seeing some patterns in the curtains moving and shifting slightly. Looked outside and window ledges of opposite houses were moving slightly and seemed to breathe. 



Music was absolutely amazing, we were listening to some folky/rocky/singersongwriter stuff, some fleetwood mac and pink floyd. Pink floyd was the high point music wise because I think the peak of both drugs was simultaneous and lasted for some time as we listened to the whole of the 30 min song ``shine on'' which seemed like only a few minutes. 



As for OEVs, they were amazingly strong and vivid pattern wise but the amount of morphing and distortion was incredible. The door seemed to get bigger and smaller, wider and narrower, further away and closer. The darker part of the room under the PC desk seemed to glow blue. The ceiling was flowing and swirling with lots of colours and patterns not just appearing on it but flowing from it into the space around the room in all dimensions. I lost all sense of time and my perception of space was so distorted I couldn't imagine any proportion. Stranger than that, occasionally after the super intense hour which I would guess at about 1-1.5 hours in, lasting for about an hour, the distortion was still completely vivid but I could walk around and balance perfectly fine. I felt like I should have been dizzy but I was fine. 



The intensity of the trip, the visuals, all of it was so long ago from me starting to write this again 3 weeks later from this point. I can only remember now as I could then the most significant parts of the trip and the funny story of the day. 



One of the things I remember which didn't really happen after the first couple of hours or so was the physical aspect I hadn't experienced before. All over my body felt great, almost in an erotic way but not really sexual although it probably could have been if my friend wasn't with me. Every now and again waves of electricity would shoot through my body not really starting from anywhere but ending in my fingertips or toes and making them curl and it probably looked like I was having an orgasm\ldots  It was definitely weird but worth it. These were throughout the most intense first couple of hours which went by like time had stopped but later seemed to have gone fast. 



There was a part where it went a little off. This was my first time experiencing a trip take a turn I didn't like. I saw patterns changing with my eyes closed. Kaleidoscopic and changing shapes and as a different song came on, something I didn't really like while tripping, the shapes morphed into swastikas with people coming out of their own bodies\ldots  It's hard to explain how the bodies morphed but it was like new torsos coming out of torsos coming out of the new torsos ad infinitum. I opened my eyes, realised I'd been lying down for a long time with them shut because it was getting dark outside, lots of music notes multicoloured, streaming in through the window like I could see the wind and it was made of music. I went to the computer and changed the song and felt amazingly better but I stood for a while as I didn't feel ready to lie and close my eyes again yet in case the darker visuals came back. Nothing scary, still interesting but a bit disturbing. 



Another point in the trip\ldots  Was staying at friends and his aunt and uncle got back and were trying to get in and I had accidentally deadlocked the door meaning it could only open from the inside. This was a new door and I was extra careful not to break it like the last one had done after lots of wear over the years and on the day of all days that we should happen to be tripping, I lock them out. We only realise after half an hour and them nearly calling a locksmith or the police to see if anything was wrong or the door was broken and it was a funny situation\ldots  For my friend.



I went downstairs and was apologising for the door being deadlocked and it was my first time out the room and the trip was still very intense, probably around 3-4 hours in. Everything was morphing around me, not as colourful as before but a lot more weirdly proportioned things. His aunt was talking to me after saying it was ok, I looked at here and tried to act normally, we'd decided to try and go find somewhere outside to enjoy the rest of the trip in peace\ldots  My friend stood by the front door down the hallway laughing his tits off. He was about a meter away but it seemed like a mile. His uncle stood on the stairs to my left with his aunt in front of me. I looked at him while speaking to his aunt. The way he smiled told me he knew. My friend was obviously fucked by the way he laughed and his aunt and uncle had seen it before so didn't care but they had never seen me doing it. I became so paranoid\ldots  Sweat was pouring off me. I couldn't concentrate as she asked me how things in my life were going like if I was ok with the gf still. Random niceties that I couldn't oblige in this state. As we spoke and my friend laughed at the awkwardness I was realising when she told him to shut up that she wasn't aware I was tripping. I thought I spoke but had only thought ``does she know'' and we spoke for a few seconds. She stopped and asked ``have you taken something'' but it was completely directed at my friend who laughed even more intently at that question because it showed us she still hadn't noticed I was tripping absolute balls. She continued speaking to me and asked me a question I didn't catch because I was gazing at her smile getting bigger and bigger floating up her face somehow, like the line of the smile was going up to touch her eyebrows. I noticed she had stopped and was waiting for me to reply as I did this when she asked ``have you taken something too?''. I burst out into apologetics thinking some massive consequence was about to drop on me but she just said it was fine. I was telling her sorry for bringing anything questionable into her home and she said it's fine because my friend does frequently- just make sure you don't deadlock the door again. We hurried outside\ldots  Here's where the trip went significantly worse for me\ldots 



We live in a terraced suburb on a hill with lots of little parks, lots of dog owners, lots of children, near a couple of schools. It was still late afternoon and, I at least, was still tripping intensely. We ventured out towards the park at the top of the hill and quickly decided we'd have to go for a walk because we couldn't sit in the park with so many people around. As we walked we went past an alley and a tall guy who seemed to look like a scary cartoon niko bellic out of gtaiv popped out walking past us not noticing us. It was so alien for me this walk because it was so clear to me I was tripping while to everyone else I probably looked normal. At one point as we realised the fun in the situation we started giggling. We had to stay quiet. I was extremely paranoid. The way my hearing sensitivity had been enhanced made things worse in a way. A door would open down the street and it felt like it was right next to me behind me.  I couldn't tell where I was so was sketching out at the thought of my gf seeing me walking around randomly in the street because it's not normal and she'd ask questions potentially leading her to find out about how I choose to spend some of my leisure time. Irrelevant. The terraced houses seemed to lean inwards above us, it felt claustrophobic not comfortable. The hills we walked up and down seemed to be vertical at times even though I was walking off. I felt like I could fall off the ground sometimes. It wasn't great being outside and we eventually went in with me wondering why my friend had insisted we went outside anyway considering his family would be fine with us staying in as long as we turned the music down. 



Eventually the trip came to an end, once we got in I just wanted it to be a calm ride down because it had been way more intense than I was expecting and we needed to be quiet. I just lied down enjoying the rest of the visuals with the music. 



Conclusion: I'll probably want to do this again, perhaps on my own as my first solo trip, to see how the difference in environment effects this trip. I feel like perhaps on my own it would have approached a +4 experience. Compared to my one other previous trip which was very different I think it was very stronger but judging by the amounts I took if I had took 40mg with MET it would have been stronger there however without the bodily effects. I didn't enjoy going outside or dealing with people while on this combination. After effects were negligible: usual feelings of tiredness and maybe hungry and thirsty from not eating or drinking (except a bit of water) for a few hours. It was very fun and memorable this time and I hope you enjoyed my story of awkwardness and misplanning! Remember to read all the guidelines about safety especially when trying combinations, be sure they will not react together negatively. I may try each substance separately in future, we had decided on this combination because we thought the effects would compliment each other nicely and the structure of the chemical did not seem like it would be reactive.
