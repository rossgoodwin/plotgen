 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SUBSTANCE\_ID\_QUESTION\#\#   



Okay so, I guess I'll start off by giving you a bit of my psychedelic history. I have taken LSD, eaten 5 grams of psilocybin mushrooms several times, and had a few full on DMT break throughs. In fact, my first psychedelic experience was a breakthrough on DMT. I guess I'm trying to say that I'm not a stranger to having my ego demolished, mind blown, etc.



So it was the second day of this festival and I had taken three tenths of mdma the night before. I spent a lot of the day thinking about lsd, and whether or not I wanted to trip at this festival. (I was sketched out about tripping because the place was packed\ldots  And there were authority figures of all sorts.) So as the day went on I started to hear more and more about lsd throughout the camp, I was getting too anxious.



So the sun falls and some good music was playing at the venue area so we started walking there from camp. On the way this hippy with dreads walked passed us and quite subtly said,'doses'. just from looking at him I got a general good vibe and went with it. We started talking and he told me this was a cousin to ALD-52. He even told me it wouldn't test as lsd and it had a bitter taste. he was mostly straight up. Mostly. He told me the doses were 5 bucks and after looking at them I felt so lucky. Me and my 3 friends ended up getting a ten strip, and everyone took 2 hits, except for me\ldots  I had no place to store it and I had no clue what to do with it. you get searched when you enter the venue and I couldn't risk that, so I just took the rest. 4 hits. (looking back, this was incredibly stupid considering the fact that I didn't even really know what it was) but that's alright, I like experimentation.



The blotter was bitter as fuck. I didn't know what to think as I had never ever had bitter lsd, but optimism was still in the air. We walked for a little while and ended up meeting up with some other friends for a bit. over time I noticed my mouth was getting more and more numb with this blotter in it, which was amusing to be honest. I made sure not to swallow, as I always feel sublingual is the way to go. We start to approach the front gates to get in and I'm chewing the paper up at this point (i had them in for at least 25 minutes) I remember I have 2 tenths of sass in my shoe and start freaking out about it a bit, but I look down and can tell its hidden well. 



We walk in through the gates and at this point I am feeling extremely bizaar. My stomach is killing my and all of the hairs on my arms would grow and bend around eachother when I looked at them. My vision was being filled with color, my palms were extremely clammy and I realize that whatever I have taken is about to be a bit overwhelming. I keep walking with my friends till we get to this water refilling station. I'm standing with them for a while, keeping cool, and my stomach lets me know its about to clean itself out. I try my hardest to keep my mouth shut, and succeed. My cheeks were out and everything but I just swallowed it. Too many people around. I tell my friends that I'm going to throw up and they just give me the whole `no your not'. Shortly after, I threw up again and it was more than my mouth could contain. After this I feel extremely strange and lost as I wandered away from my friends to throw up. 



I see them through the crowd and we meet up. They asked me if I was alright and I told them I was, so we ventured towards the stage. our group split off and I decided to stay with my close friend. We were at this show and I just kept looking at him, checking to see if this shit was affecting him like it was me. I could hardly contain myself and it had to have been obvious to anyone around us. I eventually mustered up the courage to say to him, `i think I'm going to go to the other stage'. Shit had gotten weird. on the walk back through the forest, I stopped and sat down next to a small group of 3 or so that had been drinking a bit. I don't drink much and get a bit bothered by people that get shitfaced (sorry). So I decided to just lay back and not talk much. 



As I was sitting there I caught the strongest wiff of DMT and my visuals started taking on a DMT like presence, without any entities. I sat up and started a conversation with them, and mid sentence realized that I was probably being perceived as some young kid that took too much of a research chem at a festival and is tripping face because of it. (I could have read the situation wrong but that is how I percieved it at the time) as the conversation went on I was getting so weirded out by how people comunicate. It seemed like so many conversations were just ego-filled information battles, in which both sides ignore the others opinions and try to prove their own. I couldn't take it and had to get out of the forest. 



On the walkway out of the forest I walked passed a squad of about 10 cops that were walking the direction I had just came from very quickly and it naturally just freaked me out. I walked for a while and eventually calmed my nerves. I went into a porta potty to check my sas and put it in my pocket because my feet were sweating. I kept walking towards the exit of the venue at this point and when I got close to the gate this old man turned on a red and a blue electronic glowstick. It reminded me of cops, and the sas, and the fact that there are cops waiting outside of the gate. It was basically just a stream of worry until I got out, and once I did I felt so much better, but not for long. It was only the second night and I couldn't find my campsite for anything. My vision was absolutely filled with visuals and its nearly impossible to see where I'm going in the dark. 



I asked someone if they knew where the flag above my campsite was. They asked my a different question that seemed so random and bizaar but it got me to my tent, so I guess it works. I get back to my tent and by this time I am leveling back out. I lay down, and begin to review the night. I think about the way people work in conversations and how fucked up our forms of communication are, and I begin to get into how others perceive me. It gave me one of the best ego-loss/soul cleansing experiences I have ever had, and all during this time I think that its a cousin to orange sunshine\ldots . So two of my friends that took the same thing get back to camp, and I'm still laying on the ground. I couldn't hear them coming and for some reason he decided to violently rip back the tarp and scare the shit out of me. They were both in extremely goofy moods, laughing histerically, loving life, extremely careless and fun, def still tripping hard. 



We start talking and trading experiences and had some good laughs, some weird moments, and a lot of losing shit and taking forever to find it. eventually the other friend gets back and we continue to talk. This entire time I've been extremely reserved and just quiet really, as I still have deep introspective thoughts streaming through my consciousness. Eventually my buddy straight up asks me what I thought about it and I sat up to say ` I dont know but if this is LSD, I've never had LSD before' . The trip lasted well into the day for me, and they all sort of crashed out as the sun rose. I assume they all had about 8-10 hour experiences. Id have to say mine was well into 16 hours or so, as I couldn't sleep for a very long time. The visuals faded VERY slowly, and although I've had HPPD for a little while now, this definitely intensified it.



One of the last things I said to my friend before he went to sleep, was that after taking this substance, I felt as though some doors of perception were permanantly kicked open. It sort of worried me a bit, but there was nothing to do but accept it. The next day I ranted to everyone about wanting to know what this substance was, because I do a lot of research on psychedelics. When I got home I found out 25i-nbome or 2ci-nbome was apparently going around at this festival, and once I looked into what its like to be on it, I am sure it was either 25i or 25c.



be careful with this shit guys, if you take a high dose of this substance, your going to get what your asking for and so much more.
