The following is what happened when I smoked 10X Salvia extract on November 1, 2007.



Earlier in the day, approximately 7 o'clock, I smoked a small amount of salvia, let's say a pinch. I was expecting a ridiculous roller coaster of an experience as I had read about on various websites while researching salvia. I, however, did not achieve anything so amazing. Rather, I felt strange and sort of out of place, and like I was sometimes being pulled in different directions, predominately upwards. I was with two of my friends who had also smoked salvia and none of us really felt anything, and decided to eat dinner. We ate dinner, I was still feeling out of place and strange, but nothing drastic. I wouldn't have described it as pleasurable, but I wasn't miserable. We decided that once one of our other friends was done with class we would smoke more and this time really try to get the effect. The second time, approximately 9 o'clock, we ground up the salvia, used a butane torch lighter and smoked a good deal more.



My friends and I decided that I would smoke first. I ground up my salvia and filled a bowl on our water pipe. I then proceeded to smoke it. I started to feel very strange. I began uncontrollably laughing on and off from this point on. One of my friends declared ``I can't do it.'', referring to smoking, about which a very strange dialogue between us began of alternating ``You can do it (friend's name)'', and ``No I can't''. We frantically spoke back and forth for a minute or two, which felt much longer. After that I was back to not particularly feeling much. I decided that if I was going to smoke salvia I wanted to feel the full effects. I resolved to smoke another bowl. I clumsily ground up another bowl's worth of salvia, the salvia had stupefied me a great degree. I then smoked that bowl, or what I could of it. I didn't get to the end before I left reality and my friends had to remove it from my hands.



The following is going to be hazy and difficult to explain, I don't even know what happened exactly. For the next 5 minutes or so I was in a completely different world. I felt as though the mattress I was sitting on began to tilt forward, and I to fall off. As this was going on something far more significant began to occur. I began to see my two friends laughing, but in a loop lasting about two seconds. Time had frozen. As time froze the picture began to blur, sort of creating an ``onion-skin'' effect. Then I forgot completely about the drug, about everything.



I felt as though reality had stopped and somebody was letting me know what I knew to be reality wasn't. I felt them begin to try and take me to the actual reality and I resisted. This felt particularly horrible. Eventually I gave in and decided to submit to this new reality. I couldn't let go of my current reality though, I became stuck between the two realities. Just as I was released from this phase I was able to catch a glimpse of the other reality. I don't clearly remember what it looked like. During this time I wanted to do anything to get out of it. I thought reality as I know had ended, and I truly thought it. I wanted more than anything for it to end, just all end. The other reality was dark and black and neon colors were predominate. All of this appeared to an outside observer as me making some strange movements, standing up, sitting back down, falling off the bed and then saying how horrible it was, at some point picking up a foam sword and clutching it tightly.



I wanted to return to reality and some that felt good and familiar. I was slightly panicked and I decided to smoke a little bit of a substance I knew should probably calm me down and make me feel happier. It took the extreme horribleness out of the equation, but it was traded for a slow back and forth of me conquering and misery. I decided the best bet was to change into my pajamas and get into bed. Unfortunately for a reason unbeknownst to be, I earlier decided to pour water onto my bed. I covered it with a towel and extra blankets and laid down over it. I turned on American Beauty, and lay down in bed. I felt awful, not physically, but mentally. My best way of describing would be the opposite of high, everything was bleak and I wanted it to be over.



As I lay there I realized that when I closed my eyes I could see some interesting things. Mostly shapes, I thought of a few random things, but I don't know if it could be counted as seeing them. I specifically remember thinking of the pokemon Poliwhirl, which was strange because his existence had all but vanished from my mind before this. I was able to take temporary refuge in these shapes and they could be quite entertaining. I was then struck with a strong fear that the music might end. I stumbled across my dark room to my computer and looked online for some ambient music. I listened to some of it for a while, but it really didn't do it for me. Eventually some scary music began to play and I decided I needed to switch it. I searched for an online Grateful Dead radio, I don't normally listen to them much, but I had a strong urge to this day. I put that on and the familiar and consistent songs lulled me quite a bit. I lay there in the dark with my eyes closed listened for the good part of an hour. I felt as thought I'd never want to leave. Of course I eventually did though.



After about an hour from the time of consumption I suddenly began to feel fine, it hit me very quickly. I heard my friend watching South Park outside and a few minutes later I went out and watched the episode with him. He wanted to talk about our experiences, but I couldn't quite yet, and decided to talk about them the next day. Everything was mostly normal from there on out. I had a little trouble getting to sleep, but it happened eventually. At around eight the next morning I woke up, even though I didn't really sleep well. I decided to smoke another bowl of the pleasurable stuff and maybe sleep a bit. I listened to grateful dead on the radio again. After that I awoke about three hours later feeling completely fine.



I had a horrible experience, but my friends enjoyed it. I personally wouldn't do it again, but I don't know if I'd recommend that someone shouldn't try it. It was quite the experience. Really showed how fragile our view of reality is and, I think, it showed how horrible it could be to go insane.
