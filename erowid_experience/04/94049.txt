After my last trip on 25c-nbome, I felt my anxiety about psychedelic experiences had diminished. Over the next few weeks I experimented with low doses of 25c-nbome and 4-ho-met, but the experiences were all dull, underwhelming. So, on a Saturday evening after a day full of talking to my girlfriend and playing BF3, I got that urge. The one that tells you that the time is right, it's good to trip. I had been in a good mood all day, and knew right away that there was something that my subconscious was trying to grasp, and that the quickest way there would be a mind-shatteringly powerful trip. As I have had no tryptamine experience up until now outside of dmt, I wasn't really sure what to expect and that always scared me off from heavy doses\ldots but not anymore.



T+0:00



At around 11 pm, I said goodnight to my gf, went to my room, and sat at the computer. I smoked a bong of my homemade spice (jwh-122), took 3 melatonin pills as I hear they potentiate tryptamines, and slowly eyeballed approximately 5 mg every 15 minutes for an hour, until I was at roughly 20mg. Part of me was saying I should be using the scales, but I just felt the need to take a risk, allow the chance of an overwhelming trip. Somehow this actually made me feel less anxious about it all.



 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:NOT\_WEIGHED\#\#  



T+1:00



After a few more bongs, I played some more BF3, waiting for it to kick in. There was nothing in particular I wanted to do other than experience it, and for a while I was completely engrossed in the game



T+1:50



I finished playing a few rounds, and what must have been some strong time dilation made me think at least 2 hours had passed since I started playing. Noticing that it hadn't kicked in yet, I downed another three 5mg lots over the next half an hour. I decided to go get some food, have a walk, and check the time - I realize it's only 12:50 AM, and that the first dose probably hadn't come close to peaking. And then suddenly, I just didn't care. I've had first-hand recounts from people who've accidentally taken over 100mg and come out alive, I was going to be fine.



T+2:30



I went back to my room, and had a look around for anything out of the ordinary. Everything looked normal. Especially the beanbag. I have a beanbag with an awesome blue flame design on it, and I noticed it was starting to breathe a little. Well awesome, the trip was kicking in! I continued to stare, and the beanbag warped more and more until it looked practically like it was writhing with pulsating neon maggots. I grinned my head off, realizing that I hadn't seen a visual like that for practically years - and this was just the beginning! I dove onto the beanbag, enjoying how squishy it was, how it conformed to my body. It stopped warping, and was just furniture again. I went back to bf3, but soon realized I was in no state to be playing it.



T+3:00



I decide to browse a few imageboards for a while, and jump on IRC to chat to some other tripper friends. I notice that the visuals are becoming rather intense; tracers that lasted for dozens of seconds were left behind any moving object, anything with a strong contrast made a repeating fractal of the edge, and parts of my vision were becoming segmented - I'd see little sections that had their own visual pattern, with a sharp boundry between other parts of my vision. Eventually I feel a little more normal, and realize that this was one of the `waves' that everyone talks about with mushrooms and other 4 substituted tryptamines. I decide to jump on the net, and look up some optical illusions. I find a page, and spend ages looking in wonder at the way my mind made them dance



T+4:15



Part of me says `just one more', and I decide to eat another 10mg of 4-ho-met. After a few minutes, another stronger wave comes on, and I start seeing patterns in everything. Reading or doing anything really becomes near impossible, and I decide to have another bong - this drastically increased the effects. I turned off the light in my room, and watched in wonder as these translucent white ghostly creatures danced around the room, like fractal little elves. It reminded me a lot of DMT. 



T+4:40



I eventually get over watching these amazing visuals, which included those ghostly creatures, fractal tunnels appearing everywhere, and random lights sparkling every now and then. I also got strong auditory hallucinations, hearing flanging all the time, hearing filter sweeps and sawtooth waves playing melodies - it sounded so real, if I didn't know I was tripping I would've freaked out. I go outside and have a spliff, and everything looked like it was part of a 3d game engine. I could see everything in the world as if it was a 3d rendered model of itself. I smoked the spliff while I reflected on this, thinking that possibly our brain interpreted our vision much in the same way a game displays our environment.



T+5:30



The strongest wave yet hits me, and I instinctively take another bong hit to propel me further. Looking around the room, I noticed that the visuals were getting brighter and brighter, instead of slowly fading away. I turn on the light and lie on my bed, and suddenly I feel this massive jolt - my left and right sides of my vision split and travel up and down respectively, before spiralling around and shimmering. I close my eyes. Everything starts to dance in a strange fashion, lights and fractals coalescing into forms.



Eventually, a huge pillar of neon shaman-style masks shoots upwards, forming a multidimensional fractal that spans my entire mind. This all turns into a giant mask, on a pillar of faces, which I realized was my subconscious. Suddenly it was me against it, and I must've been playing too much bf3 because it was a stylized version of one of the maps, metro. We stood face to face, and I realized the person in front of me, was me looking at me. We both shot at each other, and I knew immediately that my ego was still intact - the bullet hit `me', not my ego. I spiraled into another abstract field of vision, and after reflecting that I need to be more prepared if I'm going to experience ego death again I slowly drift off to sleep as the visuals fade in my head



Where can I begin? This is easily the most amazing experience I've had in a long time. It was the most visual, moving psychedelic I've ever had, with the peak visuals being just as vivid as DMT ones. A lot of what hasn't been said here is the emotions and sheer raw feeling that surged through me, because words can't really capture them - however I have felt more than I ever have before in my life now. The peak of the experience put me in a state of pure bliss as I soared through the fractals, in that moment I just existed and didn't worry about anything. I just was. +++ verging on ++++, to put it in Shulgin terms.
