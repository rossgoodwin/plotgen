I have tried several different psychedelic and hallucinogenic drugs (LSD, magic mushrooms, nutmeg and ketamine) and I smoke weed on a regular basis. I've never had a bad trip in my life but somehow I wasn't 100\% satisfied with my experiences. I heard a lot of drug stories about people and how they `saw all kinds of crazy shit' but in all my drug experiences I never had any hallucinations, just altered perception of things (like colors get brighter or walls seem like they're breathing) and CEV's at best.



When I saw a picture of the plant I was shocked! I know this plant, it grows absolutely everywhere! Within 20 minutes I was back home with 6 flowers and 20 leaves. I waited until next morning (I always prefer tripping during the day) and made 2 cups of tea from the plant material.



         Now for the fun part!



 9:00am : The only thing I eat when I wake up is one banana. I drink the first cup of tea  and decide not to drink the second cup because I never tried this before and who knows how I would react to it.



 9:45am : I have to go take a piss so I get up from my couch and realize I can barely stand. I remember reading about this being described as gravity increased 2x strength and that's exactly what it feels like. I stumble to the toilet and walk into the wall because I missed the bathroom doorway. This does not worry me though because I know this is normal. I actually feel happy at how fucked I am. Starting to piss was also quite difficult and when I was done I felt like my bladder was still full.



 10:00am : In the last 15 minutes I had gone to the toilet 4 times but I only managed to piss a few drops out. I give up on trying to relieve the feeling of needing to piss and just try ignore it. Before I leave the bathroom I check the mirror to see my pupils and they are huge, almost covering my whole eye.



 11:00am : I played computer games (Counter Strike Source) the last hour but I don't want to play anymore because I'm playing so poorly and ruining my rank. I feel like I'm really stoned and I can't focus on anything. I want to go to my room and just lie down for a while but just then my mom comes home. She starts talking to me and I realize I can hardly understand her and when I try to reply it is extremely difficult for me to speak. She notices something is wrong with me. I get up to go to my room and at this point gravity was like 5x normal strength and it takes all my energy to not be on all fours. Standing erect is out of the question. My mom looks really worried and asks me what I took.



I told her Datura and she knew what it was and asked if I wanted to go to the hospital. I told her that I honestly didn't overdose and please leave me alone. She did.



 11:30am : I'm in my room, lying in my bed and I notice as vividly as it can be my first hallucination! The shadows on my wall are flowing like liquid. I was overjoyed and I watched the shadows some 10 minutes and probably would have go on watching if I hadn't noticed my curtains vibrating at a high speed. Pretty soon all the objects in my room weren't still anymore. I also kept seeing flashes of light. For a second I panicked and imagined how this could easily become a really bad trip but I calmed down immediately because through the whole trip I was 100\% aware that I was tripping and that it wasn't real.



 12:45pm : A friend of mine passed by my house (this was real) to get some buds and I managed to act normal enough. Gravity was returning to normal (1.5x strength) and I managed to speak more easily, though I went to the bathroom and when I returned I forgot that anyone came over and was surprised to see my friend sitting on my bed. He didn't stay long.



 1:00pm : I think I started peaking at this point because things got really weird. After my friend left I felt like he was still in the room with me. I would answer out loud to imaginary questions he asked me and the moment I replied I would realized what I had done. I felt like he was handing me stuff and when I reached out for it I again would realize what I did. I actually really enjoyed this.



 3:00pm : I was surprised when I looked at the time because I felt like it was 1:15pm or something and my friend had just left.



Hallucinations were very intense at this point. My floor was covered with tiny black ants. There was a snake on the wall which in reality was just a crack in the wall. Any dirt spots on my wall were bugs crawling around. If I stared at anything for a few seconds it would morph and a sort of video started playing. I didn't control what the video would play, it was totally random stuff.



 7:00pm : The delirium is subsiding but the hallucinations not. I can feel the narcotic buzz of the datura and I like it. I eat some dinner and go to my friends house. I can drive my bike normally.



 The entire next day I felt the narcotic datura buzz and I got kind of sick of it by the end. I still had minor hallucinations for 2 days and my vision was blurry for 3 days.



 I really enjoyed this experience but it was purely for entertainment and I didn't learn much from it, except trust your instincts if they tell you don't take more. If I had drank that second cup I probably wouldn't have had such a positive experience. I will definitely do datura again but I don't recommend it to anyone unless they know exactly  what the effects are and are absolutely sure that's what they want.
