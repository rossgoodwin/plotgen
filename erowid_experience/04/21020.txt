I had ingested mass quanities of LSD over a period of 3 years, followed by a 3yr abstinence to all strong mind altering substances.  Then along came a day, or perhaps better said, a moment, when I suddenly felt like I was on 100mics of LSD (note this is 3yrs after any usage).  I have been on this trip for the last 8 months now, day and night, along with thousands of  thers who  suffer from \href{http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/health/hppd/}{HPPD} (hallucinogen persisting perception disorder).



When I was using LSD I took about 500 microgram dosages on average, though  I've taken up to 5000 micograms at a time. I probably tripped 200 times in a 3yr period.





Before the HPPD symptoms came on, I had *acute* anxiety disorder shit, maximum stress, and I went into a severe abnormal 2week depression before the onset of the major symptoms occured. My symptoms are complete etachment from reality, inability to think fluently, thousands of incoherent thought processes that make me feel like i'm going crazy, huge trails, light  flashes, feel like i'm dreaming 24/7, mutating furniture and other objects, static in the air, halos around objects, LSD-like body high, and probably other shit I can't think of right now.



I'm not crazy, i'm not schizophrenic, nor do I have any other mental disorder aside from having a most unfortunate and many times permanent impairment of every sense, feeling, perception, thought process: thick tracers, light flashes, halos aroundo objects, static in the air, depersonalization, and sometimes almost complete ego death, very dream like.



Fortunately for me, and not so fortunate for others i've been lucky enough to take up on a homeopathic doctors treatment which is slowly but surely eliminating all of the symptoms apposed to just treating the acute pain with an anecdote like clonazepam for the rest of my life. Just thought you might be interested, I beleived it was a myth for many years, and in a sense it is considering I don't have actual psychosis (meaning i'm not delusional)\ldots 



I have something inside of me that is sane in diametric position to all of my senses saying i'm crazy\ldots  it can be quite uncomftorable, and I was suicidal for a while, but its in no way psychological\ldots  purely physiological, and I do beleive that the metaphysical precedes the physiological, and perhaps certain doors weren't closed correctly, I was a fucking LSD guru ready to present my X-ray vision, and telekenetic exploitation to the CIA. Now i'm in the midst of alot of infernal pain\ldots  however it will pass.





At the moment, i'm suffering from HPPD again because i'm not taking the clonazepam right now (mis understanding with my doctor), therefore I don't even drink caffeine right now because it excacberates my symptoms about 2 fold.





I usually take 1mg of klonopin(clonazepam) every 12 hours, and I literally go from being completley out of my mind to about 85\% normal within 20 minutes of taking 1 to 1-1/2mg. It is a benzodiazepine that is most effective above all other benzo's for this disorder. Unfortunatley

a tolerance starts to develop in most people at some point, including in myself. However though I complained about my tolerance to the drug, I did not realize how much it was helping me until my discontinuation of it about 2 weeks ago.



I'm still in good spirits for the most part however, because I know that there is something that takes the trip away, and though i'm still very unfomftorable right now, I have faith that i'll ultimatley vanquish this in some way or another, and whether I do or not.. it's ok with me now. The klonopin really helps, i'm gonna try celexa soon though, something thats not addictive, with potential ability to help. I tried welbutrin, and all that did was make me lose 20 pounds. Hopefully i'll be back on klonopin in several days, tolerance free and all.





[ 2 months later , now 2003 ]



I was put back on klonopin, doing fine, but was suggested to see a new psychiatrist who works with drug addicts like myself, she has dealt with numerous people who suffer post LSD disorder, and said that she

was going to take me off of klonopin(This freaked me out), instead she put me on a non addictive anti-psychotic called risperdal and it is not only

more effective then klonopin, it actually balances out the chemicals and is not addictive; in addition she said that in most cases even as severe as mine, the subject can ween off of the risperdal after several years and have zero symptoms, without them ever returning. This is great news. I'm taking 2.5mg a day right now, slowly going up to 3mg. The side effects

are at first *extremely* sedating, nasal inflamation and some anxiety, but it's worth it. This drug mutes the seratonin and dopamine neurotransmitters which helps dispel the overactive LSD symptoms. You can add this to the site.
