\#\#EROWID\_NOTE:EXTREME\_HIGH\_DOSE\#\#





[Erowid Note: 15 standard shots of alcohol is roughly equivalent to 750 ml or 1 fifth (of a gallon) and is considered an extremely high dose.  Similar doses can lead to coma or death in some individuals.]





Under the No Child Left Behind signed into law by President Bush, each state was required to measure students' abilities in some form.  As a response to this, Ohio created the Ohio Graduation Test, or OGT as it is known.  This test is given to sophomores in high school over the course of one week, and where I live, they start the test at 7:30AM and take it until 10:00AM.  Because of this, all other students don't have to be in school until 10:05AM, and so my friends and I, who by now were no strangers to the fun of drinking and smoking, thought this new found time would be a great for a party.





We had an open house, and more than enough people were willing to drink, smoke, or do whatever before the shortened school day.  We started the mornings at 7:45 with some eggs and followed it up by getting pretty smashed taking shots, playing beer pong, and getting stoned.  We even had an event name: OGT Week Beerpongapalooza.  I was pretty concerned about getting caught drunk at school, so on Monday and Tuesday, I didn't really party that much.  But, by Wedensday, my nerves had calmed and I let go.  





I started the morning by taking two 20mg Adderall Extended Release pills.  Pretty soon the party was underway and about 20-30 people were at my friends house.  I was so excited that I started taking shots, and only stopped to smoke two or three bowls on my friends back porch.  When the bottle of Jose Cuervo was empty (there was about 15 shots in it when I started) I realized that I was really messed up, but I still asked everyone if they wanted to drink more.  Luckily, my friends were sober enough to realize that the last thing I needed was more alcohol.  





The last thing I remember was throwing up in my friends car as he was driving us to school.  According to him, he took me home after that and I got out in my driveway and passed out immediately.  He opened my garage and took me inside and left for school.  I woke up at 1:00PM in my bed.  I must have set an alarm because my clock was buzzing like crazy.  As I sat up, I saw that I was completely naked and completely covered in puke.  Right then, one of the worst hangovers I've ever had hit me.  I layed back down, and glanced at the carpet in my room.  There were various piles of puke skattered through out my room.





About 15 min. later, I felt alright enough to get out of my bed and walk around.  I headed toward the bathroom to take a shower, and saw that my bathtub was filled with about a quarter inch of puke.  I spent the next hour cleaning and throwing up from the smell of the cleaning chemicles.  I couldn't get all the stains out, but I figured I had it to a point where I could tell my parents that I came home and found that the dogs had thrown up.





At 2:30PM, my friend who had dropped me off earlier in the day called to make sure that I was alive.  He told me that a bunch of our friends were headed to Subway, so I agreed to meet them there.  I get dressed and walk into my garage only to find a green car that did not belong to me and a maroon car that also did not belong to me parked there.  My car was gone.  Panicked, I called the owner of the green car, and he told me that he and the owner of the maroon car decided to take mine.  He even said that I gave them permission, and that they would return my car soon.





In the end, my parents believed me that the dogs had thrown up when I was at school, but I still had to explain to my principal why I didn't make it to any of my classes.  I told her that I felt sick, but my mom didn't believe me so she didn't call to say I had permission to stay home, even though I did.  I was assigned one day of in-school suspension (basically, you sit in a small room for the entire school day).  I went to the parties on Thursday and Friday, but I held off on the drinking.  On Friday, my friend who drove me to my house on Wednesday was almost caught and threw up in the bathroom at the school.  But overall, OGT Week Beerpongapalooza was a success.





So much of a success, that we decided to continue our morning parties during the regular school week for the rest of the year.  At my school we have a regular schedule on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday.  On Wedensday and Thursday, we have block scheduling, and on the first day of block, all the students don't have to come in until 9:00AM.  My town was even famous a few years back for the `Dankfest Day' scandal, where a major newspaper uncovered kids smoking pot before school at a public park on block day.





Anyhow, to make a long story short, someone who had came to our parties got caught at school.  And expelled.  Not only that, he ratted us out in the process.  The week after his expulsion, the police department staked us out.  Three kids were pulled over on the way to school, resulting in one charge of OMVAUC, or Operating a Motor Vehicle After Underage Consumption, which in Ohio, is when a minor gets a DUI.  Some kids who didn't get pulled over made it to school and were promptly interrogated by the administration, resulting in one 10-day suspension.





Looking back on all this, I would agree that a lot of stuff got really fucked up.  But I would also say that it was a great once-in-a-lifetime experience, and that I wouldn't have changed a thing.
