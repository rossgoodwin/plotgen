I have had previous experience with salvia divinorum extracts 9x and 13x. Small quantities of salvia were mixed in with cannabis and inhaled through a water pipe. On those occasions, the primary effects I felt were those from the marijuana I had smoked. The salvia only had minimal effects, such as my perception becoming ``bent'' or distorted (similar to being drunk) and having a loss sense of direction on the walk home.



Tonight I smoked one bowl of salvia divinorum extract 5x through a water pipe in one inhale. There were five life forms involved in this experience. Two of them being my sisters, one being my sisters boyfriend, one being my dog and I. My one sister (J) was going to take part in the experience of smoking the salvia (mind you, has never hallucinated before), as well as her boyfriend (B) and I. My other sister (M) was not intending on taking part in our smoking circle. The dog was there because she loves me.



I was given the opportunity to take the first hit. Then it was to be passed to (B) and then to (J). 



What proceeded to happen was one of the most intense ``trips'' or hallucinations I have ever experienced in my entire life. Mind you, I have taken ample amounts of liquid lsd and psilocybin, but never have been so heavily encased in visual and neurological disruption and disassociation. I will try to explain the experience as best as I can, although it may not make sense because I, myself am still so unsure of what really happened.



I took my first and only hit and held it in as long as possible. I exhaled and slightly remember laughing in an uncontrollable manner while passing the bong to (B). While is the midst of laughing I see neon light bars come from over my head. Various colors, but all thin lines. Similar to color bars and stripes seen when tripping on other hallucinogens. These ``strips'' of lights become a pattern of a treasure chest top that seems to be closing over my head. These light patterns began to form all around me, making me feel like I am in a treasure chest. I feel my body being closed in it; confined. In a split second, or what seems to be, the chest top pops open and I am taken to a time and place with pirates. Yes, I said pirates. I felt as though I was a pirate and I always had been and I always had been in this place and this time. My ``real'' existence was not even a figment of imagination. Maybe it was what people call ``past life experience'', I have no idea. None of the people that were partaking in the salvia experiment were in my new reality and while I was in my new reality, I didn't care if those people in the ``real'' reality even existed.



Then came the horror.



I started to flicker back and forth from my new reality to the ``real'' reality. This became very confusing. I remember coming back from pirate land and asking (B) ``Is this real????'', and with no choice, I was hurled back into pirate world. After getting a touch of ``real'' reality for about a split second, two or three times, I fell full into pirate world again. This time something was missing. I got that strange gravity feeling again, like I did when I was enclosed in the treasure chest. This time the gravity seemed to come from my jaw but I could not see any of my body. I knew I was still a pirate, I could feel it as my presence\ldots  in my bones. I reached for my jaw and it wasn't there. Instead I felt what is best described by everyone I have read that has experimented with salvia divinorum, as the black hole. My jaw became the black hole and the black hole was seeping down my throat. I was still in pirate world and was running around grabbing my neck. As I was doing this, I flashed back to real reality for a whopping 5 seconds, realizing I was clear across the room now with my hand in my mouth reaching back down my throat. 



I remember seeing (B), (J), and (M). They were clearly staring at me like I was nuts, therefore making me paranoid and projecting me into a worse state of mind. I had enough time to tell them to ``get rid of the shit!!!'', meaning the salvia, and to take the dog upstairs. Then both realities became completely unstable and were jumping back and forth so furiously, I was in complete submissiveness. Like I lost the battle of life or something so similarly equal. It was controlling me and had been the whole time without any concept of my part in the whole thing. 



I was now back to sitting on my bed with my hand still down my throat trying to grab the black hole that was swallowing my exterior from my interior. I heard my sister (M) say ``He's gonna pop'' which threw me back into new reality. I then believed I was in a hospital operating room, tied down, convulsing with my organs spewing from my mouth like some severely sick individual. The imagery was horrendous. I came to the ``real'' reality and found everyone looking at me in the most uncomfortable manner, like I had lost my mind completely. Or like I was a homeless puppy dog in need of help. I still can't figure out what the look exactly was, but it did give me one of the worst feelings of my life. I then became completely paranoid, insisting that everyone stop staring at me and to not talk about the situation we had just experienced. I was frightened and unsure and most of all, felt like I was thrown down a rabbit hole that I wasn't expecting.



I can attest to a few different reasons as to why I had such an uncomfortable time with my salvia experience, and the main important reason is because I was not educated about the substance at all. I jumped into it like an idiot, without doing research, because after all, I've tripped a million times. Whatever this legal garbage I going to do to me, I can handle it, I'm a soldier. WRONG. I also believe being in the company of those who have never sent themselves on a spiritual journey through hallucinogens was the demise of my salvia trip. Having a bunch of people that do not understand a ``trip'', watch me burst in and out of one, makes an uncomfortable situation for you and them. Having your ``always stoned'' sister, saying ``he's gonna pop'' never helps either. 



The best reason I could come up with for telling (B) to ``get rid of that shit!!!'' (Meaning the salvia) was because I was looking out for (J), who has never touched a hallucinogen before. In the middle of me being thrown into alternate realities, I still managed to protect my sister, even though I didn't know I was even doing it. Lastly, my emotional state as of late has not been too stable and I have been somewhat depressed. I think that had an effect on the experience.



I have come to the conclusion that salvia divinorum is an extremely serious substance not to be taken as some ``weak shit'' because of its legality. I believe that salvia is the strongest hallucinogen I have ever experienced, and I draw this conclusion due to the fact that when I am on a salvia ``trip'', I am not even in touch with real reality and real existence. With LSD or mushrooms, I still have the sense of the things around you, visuals or not. With salvia, I enter a complete new world and I am not even me anymore and I never even existed anyway. Thank god it only lasts ten minutes.
