After reading about the wide range of experiences involving this phenethylamine, I decided to add to the tapestry of experential accounts. I experiemented 3 times with this compound in the summer of 2000 after reading up on it in Shulgin's book. My first experience was a lovely and secluded beach in North Carolina. Since I don't have an accurate scale, I eyeballed appoximately 50 mgs. (very questionable technique, not recommended) assuming that my low sensitivity to tryptamines and stimulants would also mean I have a low sensitivity to phenethylamines. I was in a fabulous mood, as usual, and was quite looking forward to my first experience with this compound. Well, I noticed the effects manifest themselves about an hour and a half after ingestion (on an empty stomach). Marked alterations included nausea (slight, fleeting) and slight alteration of visual perception, which was barely noticeable.  I went swimming for about 3-4 hours in the ocean and noticed that I did not feel particularly tired physically after working so hard to fight the undertow. (Rough ocean day) I never surpassed the sort of `warm glowing feeling' that the drug gave me, and was somewhat dissapointed that I did not have a full blown psychedelic experience. About six hours after ingestion, I was completely back to baseline. All in all, a very positive experience, but it would have been just as fun with no drugs at all, so\ldots \ldots \ldots 



My next experience was about a month later, this time at Walden Pond, the famous Thoroeau site in Concord, MA.  This time I decided to take quite alot, probably around 150-160 mgs. I took the compound in a gelcap on an empty stomach at 10:45 am. By noon,  I was out swimming in the pond and noticed the first alert. It felt approximately the same as before, but the naseau soon became quite intense and I realized I should prepare for possible vomiting. I did vomit, but the naseau didn't seem to subside. My freinds and I decided to walk a bit, and I dry heaved twice. I was feeling distincly uncomfortable at this point, but the naseau had now subsided. After walking for 10 minutes or so, I slipped quite comfortably into a full blown 2ct7 state. The extreme discomfort I had been feeling dissipated, and I belive that initial discomfort stemmed from my nervous system adjusting to the extreme time dialation the compound provoked. It is now about 1:00 in the afternoon, and I am in a blissful, euphoric, cosmic consciousness, God kind of state, with riotous changes in my visual perception.



We eventually went back to our townhouse, and I could not stop playing my drums!  Drugs of this sort seem to allow me to channel certain spirits or psychic energies, and the effect it has on my drumming (I usually play jazz) is remarkable! I find myself playing complicated musical ideas that I cannot achieve in my normal state of consciousness.  Anyhow, I remained in this state for quite a long time, finally drinking some beers to help me fall asleep,  which didn't happen until after 3 am, 14 hours after I started peaking! Slight visual alterations were still noticed at this time! All in all,  this was one of the best psychedelic experiences I have ever had, and it really cleared alot of cobwebs from the attic I call ME.



My third experience was at a beach in North Carolina again, and I took approximately the same dose I took at the Walden Pond trip. 

I felt toxic and vomited once, and the drug never seemed to fully kick in with respect to the visual/time dialation aspect.  However, the psychic effects were wonderful and I found myself playing my drums for five hours without stopping at all, until finally the effects dwindled to a warm, lucid, glow which left me feeling wonderful the remainder of the day.



In conclusion, my experiences with this compound were quite productive and positive, despite the vomiting, but I haven't used the compound since last summer because the expense of the material is so great and I have to take such a large amount. I was deeply saddened to read of the deaths linked to this novel drug, and would urge people to realize that phenethlyamines are quite more toxic than tryptamines, and the slow come on is necessary so that your nervous system can adjust to changes in perception. DO NOT SNORT THIS SUBSTANCE! DO NOT MIX WITH OTHER SUBSTANCES! STUDY THE OCCULT! 

I hope this has been helpful. God Bless\ldots \ldots .
