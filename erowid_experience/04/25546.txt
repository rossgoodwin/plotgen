[Erowid Note: The term `yopo' is traditionally used in reference to Anadenanthera peregrina. Recently many people have started using it to refer to both A. peregrina AND A. colubrina. This report specified only `yopo' so we do not know the exact identity of the seeds used. ]



I was interested in the ayahuasca herbs and I was trying to find a combination that wasn't so terrible for my stomach. So, I decided to try the harmala + yopo combination hoping that I could tolerate the nausea and the vomiting I had felt in the past using the banisteriopsis caapi + ps. viridis combination. Anyway, I put the powdered harmala seeds into capsules and let the yopo seeds dry completely in a low heated oven for a few hours. 



I decided to take them one night I was on the beach with my girlfriend and no one would disturbed us. I haven't eaten anything the previous 12 hours. 45 min after I ingested the capsules I was feeling great. No nausea or any bad feeling at all so I decided to take the yopo seeds. I put them in my mouth and started to chew them. Not too bad but not tasty either. By that time I was happy with my choice to use these plants because I was feeling very well. Then, after a FEW SECONDS of chewing the yopo seeds, nausea came suddenly out of nowhere. I was feeling as if an invisible hand had grabbed my stomach and was pressing it. I was afraid that I didn't had the time to swallow the yopo seeds because of the oncoming vomiting. I forced myself to swallow them. The moment they reached my stomach, I puked. 



I thought that, since I puked the seeds, I wasn't going to feel any effect at all. I was a little bit disappointed of the way things had turned out. But after a few minutes, I started to feel a little odd. Nausea was still there but there was something else too. It was a body feeling that reminded me a lot my first ayahuasca experience (which was a failure), but more intense. Probably, the DMT had been absorbed from the oral mucosa and had reached the blood stream. I can't figure any other explanation since the yopo seeds didn't stay in my stomach for more than a couple of seconds. Anyway, while I was thinking all that, that odd body feeling was getting stronger and stronger. I puked twice--with an interval of 10 minutes--and laid down. After a few minutes I couldn't feel my arms and legs and started to loose the sense of time. My body was feeling really bad, especially in the abdomen. 



By that time I started to see things behind my eyelids. Colours and unshaped patterns that soon formed a whole world in front of me. A world that only kids lived in, a world that looked like an enormous playground, a world of happiness and thoughtlessness filled with shapes and colours. At the beginning I was amazed by that landscape in front of me--maybe because I wasn't expecting it. But soon all those things started to move with an accelerated speed that was driving me insane. I had absolute no control over my visions so I opened my eyes to get rid of them. Worse. As soon as I opened my eyes I got in touch with my physical body again--which was feeling terrible. I puked once more. It was a dead end: With opened eyes there was dizziness, nausea, vomiting. I couldn't stand up nor walk. With closed eyes DMT was driving me insane. I preferred the closed-eye state, it was more tolerable, so I stayed with my eyes closed for about 3 hours. All this time I had visions and got used to their speed quite easily. 



The visions where nice but the thing that truly amazed me was that most of this time I was under the impression that an underlying change was going on deep inside me but I wasn't able to see it clearly. Like a veil was covering what went on. Although I didn't knew what was going on, I was sure that it was something positive. Anyway, 3 1/2 hours later the visions started to fade but my body was still feeling bad. I was feeling also very tired and I went to bed very easily. 



The next day there was no hangover at all. I was feeling very calm and renascent. No trace of the previous night's sickness. I hadn't ate anything until 12 hours since the ingestion had past --- although I was hungry. 

In retrospect, I think that it was a positive experience. Finally, I'd like to say two things to anyone that wants to try these substances. First, fasting is a foremost importance matter and second, always have a sitter near you because, unlike other substances, with these ones you are in no position to help yourself nor react effectively if something happens.
