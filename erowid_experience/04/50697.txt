I have never previously taken drugs on a daily basis nor abused any of which I have taken before.  Having said that, I have been perscribed Vicodin and Codeine before, both of which are nothing when compared to the effects of Adderall.  



Orginally, I was perscribed 10mg of Adderall IR and XR (tablet and capsule form) for ADHD.  I was supposed to take XR everyday in the morning, and take the IR at my discretion whenever I needed a boost.  After about 3 or 4 weeks, the aggression, which was supposed to subside after my body got used to the drug was still plainly visible to all.  The dosage was then upped to 20mg of XR, but the IR was left to 10mg.  After I built up a tolerance, the dosage was yet again increased to my surprise 30mg of XR, and 20mg of IR.  



In a regular 30mg day of XR, I'll experience paranoia (people are watching me), decreased appetite, and increased breathing/heart rate.  I often see things out of the corner of my eye.  Sometimes they were blurs, other times people standing barely in my peripheral vision.



The blog section below was written during the experience, the rest written on the post date of this blog.  I was somewhat distracted\ldots 







***The Experience - February 12, 2006***



T +1:00 - Techno has never sounded this good.  After 60mg of IR Adderall, I suppose anything would be great.  I had to do it, I had to know how it would feel, how it affected me.  Currently I feel pretty good.  Dancing to Infected mushroom, raving almost.  I'm resisting the strong urge to take more Adderall, I know and am ready for the depression stage.  



(This next paragraph I had forgotten to write after I was under the influence, I had forgotten to write it when I actually took the Adderall.  Better late then never, right?)



T + 1:15 - ground up 3 20mg tablets of Adderall IR.  Tried to snort, maybe got about 1/2 to 3 quarters of one 20mg pill, ate the rest.  Ate with some oreos and milk.  Tasted nasty shit.  Thought I should put this in here, little late. 



T + 1:30 - They say `fly with a co-pilot' when doing this kinda stuff.  Kinda stupid really, how are 2 smashed people any better than 1? hahaha.  I am trying to take every precaution to keep myself safe.  I tried taking my heart beat but I don't think I'm doing it right, plus I can't seem to count right.  I keep getting distracted.  



T + 2:00 - Stomach ache. Oh god its pretty bad.  But only when I tihnk about it.  All I need to do is think about something else.  But I'm trying to stay in tune with everything I'm feeling and not let myself get too spaced out.  I may take more later. No no no no, I aint taking anymore.  I'm taking 60 mgs and thats it.  I've read lots of people taking Adderall for weeks at a time tripping.  Taking more and more, no fucking way am I doing that.  This is for experimentation only.  The side affects have been mostly expected so far.  Euphoria, stomach ache, and slight `warping' of sight out of the corner of my eyes.  My mind is going so fast, I can't type fast enuff.   I'm even talking with myself as I type this.  I can't even talk fast enough, I hate typos.  I'm gonna go clean the house now.







***February 19, 2006: 6 days later***



I never did take anymore.  I felt like I was dirty as shit.  Although through the duration I never actually had any hallucinations, but I don't think I insufflated enough to get the effect.  I did feel incredibly fuckin good.  The good feeling didn't last long (about an hour), I didn't crash but I felt the normal affects of Adderall. I got too fustrated with the slow typing (even though I type average 65 words per min), I wound up cleaning the entire house, vaccuuming, dusting and putting things in the right place.  The kitchen floor was immacuately vaccuumed and then swiffered, cleaned, vaccuumed, and promtply swiffered again.  I cleaned from around 2ish, to around 7ish.



In all, I vaccuumed the house, and the kitchen floor twice, and swiffered it more times than I care to count, dusted the house, windexed the first floor windows inside and outside, unclogged the toliet, fixed the garage door opener, straightened up the entire floor, tidied the jacket/food closet, washed and straightened up the fridge of all left-overs over a week old, vaccuumed my dog (shes a german shepard and shes shedding, theres ALOT of fur that comes off her), unclogged the gutters, took out the trash, CLEANED the trash can and lastly performed some general maintenance on ALL computers.  I only stopped because my girlfriend called me and practically begged me to come see her.



Some things I did notice however, I would get incredibly fustrated at the smallest things.  Childish as it may be, I got so infuriated that the vaccuum's hose wasn't long enough that I kicked the vaccuum.  The things that impeded my progress are what pissed me off to no end.  I had an indescribable desire to do something useful.  All the chores decribed above were done simultaneously, although each did take much more time to complete.  I'd start vaccuuming, walk past the trashbag I had set to down to inspect the dirty windows, at which point I went to the closet to get the windex and upon the sight of the messy closet, started mental plans for re-organization, but then got a great idea and working on the closet to see if my idea was feasible.  



After some time, my sister walked in the door with her b/f to get a desk.  After helping them get the desk through the desk into the car, I noticed the `unfixable' garage door opener.  I had no previous knowledge of garage door openers or any electrics.  Sure enough, I got distracted *SHOCK!*.  After numerous cuts and electrocutions, I had fixed it.  I walked inside my house and then noticed the partially vaccuumed living room.  I'm sure you can imagine what happened after that.



After is everything said and done, I had `done' a hell of a lot more than I had `said.'  I think for the most part, there wasn't too much more Adderall in my system than normal.  Since I was only able to insufflate less than 1 pill, and swallowed the rest, my best guest is that the snorted stuff was what gave me the happiness, and everything after was caused by the digested portion, the rest of the unsnorted portion.
