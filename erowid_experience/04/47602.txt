Well I am a 24 year old girl that likes her share of partying and experimenting with drugs. I mostly drink alcohol and am not used to any kind of hallucinogenic drug. My boyfriend and I share an upstairs/downstairs house in a small town. My boyf's one friend called and said that he had some trip that we woud be interested in. When he brought it to us I was shocked, I remember seeing them spiny seed pods all over as a little kid. They told us in order to get the whole trip feeling that we would have to take all the seeds out of the pod, put them all in our mouths and chew them for a good 5 minutes, then swallow and wash them down with water. (They totally did not know what they were talking about for a matter of fact they did not even know the name of the plant, I did all the research for them, unfortunately two days after I did the stuff!) 



I was a bit reluctant to do this because I did not believe that something that grows as a weed could make you see things. My boyf did not need anyone to twist his arm to take them, he munched them down as soon as he seen them. I ate them anyways at about 5:30pm. Immediately after, I got extremely thirsty and no matter how much I drank I couldn't quench my thirst. Right after that my body felt very heavy and I was very tired. I said, `alright guys I have to go to bed.' They told me if I did I would ruin my trip --WRONG!!! I didn't care what they said, I went to my room and layed down. It gets kinda hazy from here so bear with me. 



I remember laying there thinking that I was so tired but for some reason I wasn't falling asleep. I threw my legs over the side of the bed and tried standing up (my bed's on the floor so it's not very high up), there was no way. I even tried using my hands to push me up, but fell on my face and got discouraged. I probably tried about 10 more times before giving up. I must have fell asleep for like 6-7 hours because the next thing I remember was seeing the clock that said 1am. I remember I glanced at the clock almost the rest of the night. My boyf was asleep down on the couch and when I woke him up I was horrified at the sight. His face was very distorted. There was no dimension to his face. You know if you sleep on something and get wrinkles in your skin, well he had 100's of wrinkles on his big, square, flat face. Plus his eyes were huge slits and his lips were huge, kinda like the people on MAURY. It had me so scared, all I kept thinking was, `There's no way I can stay with him if he's going to continue on looking like this.' Then everything's a blur again. My boyf must have wanted me to come up to bed with him because the next thing I remember is that we were in the bedroom. 



We had our overhead light on, which casts a yellowish tint on everything, but the tint played a big part on my trip. I was looking at my footchest next to my bed and was terrified once again. I saw millions of bugs. I think the reason I had that vision is because right now my cat has fleas and we were constantly seeing them and it was pissing me off. Anyways, there were about a million cockroaches crawling around. I seen these 2 very different bugs that I had never seen before (the reason is because I made them up.) They were 2 very large, multi-colored beetles. I actually seen them moving around. I had never in my life had a fear of bugs but for some reason I was totally mortified from these bugs. I woke up my boyf (who was restored back to normal -- thank god). I was frantic. I told him that he had to get them or I wasn't sleeping with him. At this point, I was very annoyed with the bugs and my boyf, that didn't seem interested in the bugs at all. 



I kept walking up and down the stairs (very slowly, like a person that couldn't even walk). Finally I remember being upstairs in the bathroom. I looked in the mirror and had 2 black eyes, I thought that my boyf had beat me up. I kept sitting o the toilet and trying to pee, but a little dribble would come out. I kept going back to the bedroom, I looked down at my hands and it looked like I had a terrible sunburn. I remember being very panic-stricken and feeling like I was going to have a heart-attack. 



I remember having many discussions with my boyf at how scared I was (he says I was talking jibberish the whole time). I also had a thought that I was going insane and would never be normal again. The next thing I know, I got really sick. My boyf helped me to the bathroom. I puked in the tub twice, on the toilet, and on the sink. It was mostly just the seeds and an orange coloration of some juice that I had drank earlier. It was a mess in there. I think me puking might have eased the tripping feeling, or at least put it into some kind of perspective because when I went back into the bedroom and seen the bugs I wasn't afraid, I found a hammer and decided to try killing them. I smacked a roach with it and it just disappeared. That's when it dawned on me that I was just imagining all the bugs. Once I came to that conclusion I started feeling a little more calm. I went over to our window and seen 2 hummingbirds flying right out in front of me. I looked at the tree branch and seen hundreds more perched on it. I yelled to my boyf to come and see, but he didn't even respond to me. I didn't even pay that any attention. 



I studied the birds a little longer and decided just to go to sleep. I went over to the light switch to turn it off. This was a huge task as my body was no longer responding to my brain. I was like 5 feet away from the wall, reaching out batting at the switch. My boyf says that it took me like half an hour to finally get the light off. Up to that point I had completely forgotten about taking the datura, and when I remembered I was like\ldots WOAH!!! I then was ready to lay in bed with my boyf. I'm not sure if I was still hallucinating or not. I would shut my eyes and go into a very weird state of mind. I would think that I was smoking a cigarette and having a very in depth conversation with my boyf and suddenly jolt back to reality thinking I had dropped my smoke and I was burning my boyf and frantically search for it, after 2 or 3 minutes figure out that I was imagining all of it and lay back down. I did this at least 25-35 times over a period of 5 or 6 hours. Finally, about 12 in the afternoon we rolled out of bed. We both noticed the blurred vision, which shortly wore off. His pupil's were dialated for 2 whole days, but mine weren't. 



I would have to say off of my whole experience I wasn't exactly dissatisfied. Yes, I did get very, very paranoid, but after I realized that it was because I had taken a very powerful drug I really calmed down. I wish that I would have done the research for this stuff before I just indulged in it. The kids that sold us the stuff ended up apologizing for selling it without even knowing what it was and that they were never going to do it again. That's how bad it scared them. I guess 15 of the 30 people that munched the seeds down went to the hospital. In my opinion, it's because they didn't have enough knowledge of the stuff they were messing with and the lack of somewhat good supervision. I know if my boyf wouldn't of been there I could have possibly ended up in the hospital. Even though he wasn't even really paying attention to me, at least he was there to bounce my crazy ideas off of. I know if he would have freaked out about the bugs, I would have flipped. 



If there are people out there that want to try this but are too bugged out by all the negative stories on here, I would advise to not do too much: I've found that eating half the seeds in a pod is totally enough. It's best to not have anything to do and to make sure to have at least 2 days put aside for chilling after. I would make sure to have someone I trust around, whether it be a good friend or my significant other, just to have someone half-coherent with me. It is probably a good idea to baby proof the place and make sure all loose objects, knifes, scissors are out of harms way. Your balance is totally off when it comes to this drug so be very careful! Out of all the stuff I have been reading on this plant, it stresses that it is poisonous and it could kill, on that I have to say: if you have any kind of heart problem.. stear clear of this stuff. Well, I hope that this story was both informational and humorous to read. I do think that I will do it again, but this is the kind of thing that you only do every few months\ldots .Peace out and be careful.
