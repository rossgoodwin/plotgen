This is a report about the most powerful experience I've ever endured on a drug.  I'll begin by saying that I completely took for granted the quantity and quality of salvia I was using, as I had never `broken through' before and regarded salvia as `no big deal'.  Boy was I wrong.



Let me set the seen: It my first night back home from my first semester away at college.  I was permanently leaving the college I was at because I didn't like it at all.  My parents begged me for months to give it a chance and to please stay, but I refused.  Now during my final days at the college, I ordered and received a package containing 0.5 grams of 4 different strengths of salvia.  I ordered the green (about 5x), the yellow, the red, and the purple (24x) boxes.  I made this order in anticipation of being in my hometown and experimenting with it with my good friend whom I speak to about tripping and drugs and whatnot.



Now as I said earlier, I HIGHLY underestimated salvia, because I had never had a very strong trip.  I now look back and realize that was because I had never done anything over 10x.  The night I got home, I decided to smoke some of the purple 24x salvia.  Because I wanted a strong-as-possible experience, I weighed out a nice bong hits worth of salvia on my scale to just about 1.0 grams.  Man, looking back right now I want to straight up smack myself in the face for being so stupid.  I packed the hefty dose of salvia into the slide of bong.  I was debating whether or not to video tape my trip, but I decided against it (thank god!)



I take a seat on my bed and crack my window.  I proceed to torch the salvia.  I take it all in with one giant rip (uh-oh).  I hold it in for as long as I can, which ended up being about 20 seconds.  I remember not 10 seconds after I exhaled, I felt a force stronger than any force that could ever be.  That force was slowly but surely pulling me out my window.  Right before the force took full control, I remember sitting and saying clearly `Oh, shit!'



I was pulled awkwardly right through my window to the outside world.  I didn't see how this was possible, but I didn't question it.  This is the point where I completely forgot I smoked salvia althogether.  The force pulling me was not cooperating with the force of gravity, and I didn't know what to do.  I lay outside on top of the bush outside my window, though I continue to fall [somehow].  The next thing I know, I'm back in my room - but not for long.  All of a sudden, it begins - the traveling through different dimensions.  All of a sudden, the living room of my old house that I lived in 10 years ago was where I was.  I was bewildered, but I couldn't really focus.  I was focusing on what felt like a concrete statue, about waist high, right in front me.  The force from earlier was stronger than ever, and it was awkwardly pulling and twisting me over and around the statue.  I kept trying to jump over it or get out of the way of it, but I couldn't.  



After about 10 seconds in the old living room, I am shot back into my room.  To describe this dimensional journey, picture a old-school Viewmaster, a device which lets you view multiple pictures on a strip of paper.  You pull a lever, and ever time you pull the lever, a new picture come up.  Well, there was some kind of spirit looking through their Viewmaster, and I was stuck inside.  The only problem was that I was in every picture, and everytime the picture (my surroundings) would change, I would remain.  So anyway, Im back in my room.  But, again, not for long.  I dont remember every place I traveled, but the most vivid one I remember was being shot to right outside my parents bedroom, opening the door, and saying in a panic `Mom\ldots \ldots .mom'.  I heard her respond, but it was too late.  I was gone.  My though process at this point was basically this:  `This is it, I'm going to die like this, I'm going to be stuck on a dimensional conveyer belt for the rest of eternity'.  But  I was still battling, because I didn't know what else to do.  I then heard my mom's voice saying my name, but I didn't know where it was coming from.  All of a sudden, I was back on my bed, freaking out and kicking wildly at my nightstand (knocking over a water bottle).  My mom was there trying to hold me down, but I simply had no idea what was going on at this point. 



Now I was in my room, now accompanied by my parents.  The horrified look on their faces didn't register to me because I was still horrified myself.  I hopped off my bed, started babbling and walking around fast.  I was trying to explain what was happening to my parents, but I couldn't make sentences.  I remembered during my babbling my dad saying `We're going to have to call someone (meaning an ambulance or something), and I remember saying `NO\ldots .JUST\ldots WAIT\ldots .JUST\ldots .'while breathing heavily.  I was still not sure if I was safe  or not.  I thought any second now, I would be blasted away to another dimension again.  It was beginning to come to me that I was coming back to reality.  I just hoped my parents weren't really there.  But of course, I waited and waited, but the reality didn't change.  I started to realize what had just happened: that I smoked salvia.  As soon as I remembered smoking it, I was in utter shock.  I didn't know what to say.  In an instant, I was back. In reality.  My dad looking at me like I had just murdered a man, my mom cleaning the water I had spilled on my rug.  A lot of dramamtic talking went on (mostly by them; I was still kind of babbling).  



As soon as they left my room, I lay in my bed in the dark and really let sink in what just happened.  I went through everything that happened in my head.  I really could not believe it.  It was like nothing I had ever thought could even be remotely possible.  I knew what had happened, but I didn't want to belive it.  The next day, I talked to my parents in a more clear state of my mind.  Apparently, they heard my screaming in panic from my room, came running, broke through my locked door to find me jumping around on my bed like a maniac.  To this day, my relationship with my parents, and my whole family, has not been fully mended.  



In conclusion, I strongly urge people who want to use salvia to 1) NEVER do it when anyone is home, and 2) have a sitter present to calm you down and such.  A little preperation can go a long way.  I dont know what would have happened if I did salvia in the right setting, but I just know it would have ended better.



Alas, my `Death Trip'.
