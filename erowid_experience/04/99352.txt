You could say that I have no experience with psychedelics what so ever. I stupidly went into it not knowing anything about nbombe and totally forgetting my first experience with it 2 weeks prior. All I was thinking about was meeting my friend and buying 15 bucks worth of it. In my days of doing mind altering substances I have only smoked marijuana (a lot), 25c-nbombe once before, alcohol, and the common pharmaceutical pills that you can get. 



It was a hot day in the summer and me and some friends were going to meet up with our friend down by the park to bring him with us to a party later that night. Lucky for me we were going in the direction of a good friend that was going to sell me some 25c-nbombe at the park. I was thinking that I was just going to do some hits of it and casually walk to a local grocery store to meet up with them after. We split up and they go their way and I head down to the bench in the park to meet my friend who I will call J and his girlfriend. I get there, greet them, start talking, take a hit of weed from his pipe, few minutes later kind of high (I am a huge light weight when it comes to weed) and feel really good. I then give him my money and brings out a bag with white powder that he got online about 3 weeks ago. He is a very experienced drug user especially in the psychedelic field of drugs so he measures out on a pen cap what the correct dosage should be for me being a newbie for this type of drug. He couldn't really calculate about how much 15 bucks would be of the powder probably because he was really blazed already from smoking before. Being me and wanting to get the most out of my money and more, I started snorting all of it through a straw he had. Getting way more than expected I got the sides too. Before he told me 15 bucks worth was a lot for a person not as experienced but I did it anyways and told him its fine. Not being smart I noticed a bunch forming on the underside of the pen cap and snorted that too which was just as much as the top side. Seeing this he told me that that was a lot and it was probably about 20-30 hits. Totally got my money's worth and said goodbye and headed up the road to get to my friends. As I was leaving he told me to call him on the phone to tell him how I felt when I started tripping. That got me thinking that I probably did more than he has ever done and he wanted to see how crazy it was.



 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:NOT\_WEIGHED\#\# 



I started skating up the street and passed by a busy restaurant feeling very calm, relaxed and eager for the trip. Upon standing on the sidewalk waiting for traffic to clear to cross the road to my friends, I got my signs of a come up from the nbome. It was only 15 minutes since I snorted it and it was kicking in. I began looking around and seeing purple spots and getting that chemical feeling in my body. The purple spots were like if you looked into the sun and you see those white smudges in the corners of your eyes. It was like that but purple. I started feeling very scared and anxious. The street I wanted to pass was busy as hell and there was no way I could cross it. I called my friend M who was at the grocery store to tell him I couldn't handle crossing the street. I forgot our conversation but he later told me I was not listening to him and panicking the whole conversation. M sent our friend D over to get me.



D gets across the street no problem and I feel comforted a little bit. I call J to tell him what is happening and luckily they are still in the park and we decide to go back to the park to hang out with them until I come down. The busy street and every little sound gets amplified to the point where that alone would make me have a bad trip. As we are walking back the same way I came, I began telling D about what is happening and how I'm freaking out. D couldn't really relate or help because he hasn't done anything other than weed and alcohol so all he could really say was everything is fine.



We began walking by the busy restaurant with hundreds of voices and music blaring into my ears. Being self conscious at this point, trying to seem normal I started to try my best as looking like a person who is not tripping balls. This was a hard thing to do because I felt like I was pissing my pants every 2 minutes and having to check them and feel them. That must've looked weird. I was wearing a buttoned up red and blue patterned shirt with really trippy patterns on it. I looked at my shirt a few times seeing the reds and blues bleed all over the shirt and soak up then bleed again over and over. I was also wearing green pants that started having a set of darker green veins all over it moving about. It was like a scribble of a crayon moving really fast around my pants. As we walked I kept asking D if I urinated in my pants but I didn't. I didn't get to really enjoy everything and forgot most of the hallucinations because of panicking, fearing for my life and my sanity. 



We eventually meet up with J and his girlfriend and we sit down in the park in a circle formation. I look around to find a dad and son playing catch and some people on some swing sets in the background. I was overly paranoid and thinking this wasn't the best place to be. Everyone told me that everything was fine once again and J took out his pipe to smoke. I got really anxious about this, J offered me some but I declined being that I was already tripping balls and didn't want it to get more worse. J also offered me some music from his iPod but I declined again because that would add extra sounds to my life at that point and that wouldn't have been a good decision to me at the time.



Just then it seemed that I had reached the peak of the high and had sensory overload with all the hallucinations. I recall looking at the grass across the park to find that every little blade of grass was outlined in rainbow. The rainbow outlines were flashing from every color in the rainbow rapidly. That just shows that it was a lot to take in at the time. I began thinking fast on how to get rid of the high and I came up with trying to sleep it off. I decided it wouldn't look weird because people sleep in parks all the time so I leaned back still in cross legged position trying to sleep but the closed eye visuals were very intense on top of me shaking like mad. I then heard J's voice saying that I shouldn't try to sleep because the closed eye visuals are more crazier than the open eyed ones. I tried sleeping 3 times but couldn't so I gave up.



I thought I was at my peak but it got worse. Everything my friends said echoed multiple times and at that point it seemed as if I was fucked. I began telling them that I wanted them to call my mom over and over and asking if I could lay in someone's bed because it seemed that that was the best thing to do. After that it seemed I blacked out or something because I don't remember anything until it got dark. My sense of time was really messed up and didn't know anything. We all headed for the bus station and by that time I had come down enough to walk. After the 2 trips I have had with this substance I seem to notice a blue or green skin discoloration on my face. 



Anyways if it wasn't for my friends I would have either got in trouble or worse. For my second time I should have known better to not do that much or in my situation. Since then I have not done any psychedelics but continued smoking weed. For a couple weeks afterward I had this constipated feeling and worsened eye sight but I am still not for sure about the eyesight.
