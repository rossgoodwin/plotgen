At my college campus (I'm a design major), drugs are readily available for those who seek them. Growing tired of pot, I decided to throw in \$25 for a lump of chocolate supposedly containing an 1/8th of shrooms. Seeing how thanksgiving break was just around the corner, I saved another \$25 and purchased a second chocolate, and saved the 2 so I could trip with a good friend of mine over break.



The night I got home, Nader (my friend) gave me a call and we smoked a few bowls of weed in his car, and probably picked up some free food at Wendy's (where he works). We returned to my house and chilled in the basement until my parental units were in bed, and also waited a little for our food to digest. At around midnight, we ate a chocolate each. The one I ate came from an earlier batch then the one I gave to Nader, and had chunks of something (presumably shrooms) scattered throughout it. Nader, however said his tasted just like chocolate. Either way we both tripped, but I am convinced my experience was more intense than his\ldots 



Anyway, we played some videogames, but about half an hour into them, we began to feel anxious. I set down my controller and looked at a cord hanging down from light on the ceiling\ldots  it looked different, but I couldnt quite put my finger on the change. I explored a few other objects near me, and noticed that they too appeared to be different. The walls began to `breathe' and we decided to go for a walk, but took some vitamin C pills before we set out. By this time I could definitely feel something brewing inside of me, so we walked around my neighborhood, waiting for the trip to fully take affect.



Everything began to look as though I had never seen it before. A group of trees I have passed by hundreds of times before looked foreign and almost intimidating, even though I knew where I was and whos trees they were. Then, all of the sudden, It hit me like a freight train. I felt an intense surge of energy, happyness and wonder, followed by another, and another and another. Each surge would leave me feeling so incredible that I was certain the shrooms had reached full effect, but another surge would soon follow. I felt confused, content, incredible, energetic, and adventurous. Nader and I decided to head over to my friend Pauls house, normally a 10-15 minute walk, mainly as an excuse to give us something to do and stuff to look at.



As I walked down the streets, I looked at shadows, trees, the moon, reflections\ldots  everything I possibly could. Trees were massive, mystical creatures with claw-like branches. Street lights became orangey spotlights, casting incredible shadows in all directions. Trails were visible when I closed my eyes or looked away from light sources. Something as boring as my neighborhood became the most beautiful place I had ever been to, full of wonder and amusement. We followed some old train tracks which ran alongside a dilapidated factory, balancing ourselves on the metal parts, and just taking in everything we possibly could. We made it to the parking lot of the factory, and I proceeded to stand on a bench and look down a tunnel made up of train tracks, trees and the factory. I could focus on even the tiniest details with great clarity-- even objects in the distance seemed like they were right in front of me. As Nader described it, `Everything looks 2d.'



The walk took us hours because we were distracted by everything in sight-- stopping to examine the beauty which surrounded us. We finally reached Pauls house\ldots  only to find he wasn't home. Standing under a streetlight, confused as hell and failing to form coherent sentences as we tried to figure out what to do next, the sluggish `I own the road' sound of a cop cruiser crept down the street. With his window rolled down, the officer stared us in the eyes as he drove by at about 1mph, and then he drove past us, seemingly uninterested. Nader and I exchanged a quick `oh shit lets get out of here' glance, and began to head in the opposite direction. Upon our departure, however, the cop turned around and came back, with his lights on and his spotlight shining in our eyes.



There we were, tripping our asses off, surrounded by a dancing red and blue light pattern cast by the cops lights, with a spotlight in our eyes-- Not a good situation to be in your first time tripping. The cop came out of his vehicle, took our IDs, and went back in his car, slightly tilting the spotlight as though he were examining us. Nader and I kept saying to each other `he has nothing on us, he hasnt seen us do anything wrong\ldots ' I had to struggle to keep my composure, as my mind kept forgetting about the police and instead focusing on the sights and sounds introduced by the situation. After about 10 minutes he came out of his car and said some BS about how he thought we tripped a burglar alarm in an office building that we hadnt even come close to (This isnt the first time I was stopped by cops in my town for some completely random thing I hadnt done). he made us walk to the office while he drove behind us (possibly a trick to see if we were drunk or something), but Nader and I were able to control ourselves perfectly. When we got there, there was another officer waiting for us, and they interrogated us with the usual questions: `where did you come from?' `where were you going?' `what are you doing this late at night?' and blah blah blah. All the while they carefully watched our eyes and body language for signs of fear, doubt, and untruthfulness.



To make a long story a little less long, they eventually gave up because they couldnt prove we had done anything wrong, and did not notice we were tripping. they gave us back our IDs, and left us standing there in awe. We headed home in the same manner, slightly shooken up, but still enjoying ourselves. Nader started to come down and took a couple pisses on the way back. When we reached my house, he said he was tired and went to bed in the basement. I, however, was still amused and excited, and wanted to experiment a little.



by now it was 5 or 6 AM. I drank a little water, not because I was thirsty, but because I figured I should. I felt the water in my mouth, but it seemed to dissapear as I swallowed it. I couldnt really feel it go down. Then I attempted to eat some banana bread. At first it tasted really good, but as my saliva soaked into it, it became disgusting. I felt no urge whatsoever to swallow it, and pondered over the concept of consuming food for a while before spitting it out. Then I headed upstairs to my room, sat on my bed, and looked at the wall which was covered in crazy shadows cast by abnormal lightbulbs in my lamp. Green and purple patterns flowed through the shadows and followed the countours of everything contrasting my white bedroom walls. I spent an hour or two observing these patterns in various parts of the house, took a piss, and felt almost depressed that my trip was fading away.



Before I layed down for sleep, I took a good look at my 2 dogs. As I focused on their shapes, they began to `breathe' in the same manner the walls had as my trip first began; their paws and ears and tails shifted proportions. One of them is white, and the other is brown. However, as I looked at the white dog, I mainly noticed darkness in his fur, and as I looked at the brown dog, I mainly noticed the highlights cast upon him by my lamp-- an example of how everything I had encountered that evening was perceived by me in an abnormal fashion. I probobly fell asleep around 7:30 or 8 AM.



The trip was an incredible experience. Even when the police had harassed us, I felt very little paranoia, and was completely comfortable with myself and my surroundings. Although I have not tripped since this experience (due to time/money/school/etc), I wish to do it again in daylight, for the visual patterns were only apparent when I went inside in the light and the only time i got to to see brilliant colors was when the cops stopped us. I hope this report is useful to others.
