A couple of weeks ago I decided to try nitrous again.  I had done it a couple times before while on X once, and meth the other, but it never gave me that intense feeling everyone describes it as having.



The last time I did it was 6 years ago, and I never had any health problem then, or even a hangover from it, but this time that all changed.



I bought 1 box of nitrous about two weeks ago, and came home and wanted to try some immediately.  But I couldn't figure the damned cracker out, so I waited for my brother to come home from work.  As soon as he walked in the door I handed him the cracker and the balloon, and without a word he grinned, sat down on the couch, put some drum and bass on and began huffing.  After he was done he reminded me how the cracker worked and then handed me my first hit.



I was cautious, so I only inhaled a few times and the high wasn't intense.  But I still wanted another one\ldots and another\ldots and another.  After the third hit I was flying.  Each hit following was pure orgasmic bliss, I felt extreme relaxation, an orgasmic rush throughout my whole body, everything tingled with pleasure and my head was buzzing and vibrating.  It was wonderful.



We polished off the box in about 45 minutes.  I'm guessing I had about 12 hits all in all. 



I felt sort of dopey and I had a headache, but I felt okay and started doing some chores.  But then I got this uncomfortable stomach ache and nausea and I was exhausted, so I took a nap.  



Now, I'm big on astrology, spirits and symbolism in day to day life, and I am always looking for signs to guide me, although I rarely listen, but should.  Well, something weird happened that night.  Before I took a nap I opened the sliding door in the living room to get some air in the house, and then I forgot to close it, as I was completely passed out.  



Well, I woke up when my dad came home that night and all of a sudden a bat whizzed by our heads in the kitchen!  I freaked, but my dad played it cool and let the bat out the door with no problems.  



I took this as a warning, and of course, I didn't listen.



Two days later I bought two boxes of nitrous, thinking I'd invite some friends over to do them with me that weekend.  Well, that night I did about 6, the next night 4, then I started getting the cramps again and stopped.  Then Labor day weekend rolled around and that Saturday (about 2 days after my last dose) me, my brother and my boyfriend decided to do a few nitrous hits.  



I was very drunk and had taken some pain killers earlier that day, so I was floatin' by this time.  I couldn't wait to get that sweet, cold air in my lungs and bob to the vibrations.  After about 5 doubles, my brother passed out on the floor, and me and my boyfriend continued to do singles after we lost him.  



Then we got this the idea to have sex while huffing, and the experience was absolutely mind blowing!  Having an actual orgasm while feeling those nitrous rushes is beyond words.  All I can say is amazing! 



By the time we got tired and went to bed, I had easily huffed 12 to 14 cartridges.



But, this time I had no hangover.  I felt fine the next day, and I even went out and partied Sunday.  But as soon as I came home that night, I huffed 6 more by myself.



I continued to huff 3 to 5 cartridges a night before bed, until tonight (Thursday).



Last night I did 4 cartridges, felt fine and then went to bed.  Then around 3am I got horrible stomach cramps, chills, tingling, and nausea.  My thoughts were jumbled and my ears were ringing.   At first thought I had food poisoning, because that's what it felt like, but I didn't vomit, although I wanted to.  I also had no fever, so I thought it probably wasn't a virus either.  Around 8am my stomach began to settle, but I had a horrendous headache on the left side of my face and my nose became stuffed and weepy on that side too.  



I had to run some errands, and somehow dragged myself to do them.  When they were all done, I suddenly found I was starving!  I went to McDonalds and ate two egg and bacon biscuits, a hash brown and 2 caffeine free diet Pepsis.  Miraculously my headache disappeared and my sinus' cleared.  I came home and passed out, as I was absolutely exhausted.  I could hardly find the strength to get in my pajamas.  I woke up around 2pm, got some water and went back to sleep.  I then woke up at 7pm, and the stomach cramps came back.  I found that my back and chest were also aching, but I was still very hungry.  I have a craving for meat and cheese, and diet coke for some reason.  I usually drink only one or two a day, but I've had 5 today already.  I never got a fever, or the chills again, and besides the stomach pains, I haven't had any other stomach symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea).  So, while not certain, I am attributing my health problems to nitrous.  My mind is dull, and I am having one Hell of a time trying to type this.  I am still weak, tired, and my gut aches terribly, but at least it's not worsening.  Hopefully I'll feel better tomorrow.  



I think now I'll listen to the bat and stop this nitrous nonsense and stick to just beer.  It was fun while it lasted, but I truly was getting addicted.  I have about a dozen cartridges left and I need to find someone who will take them from me.  I just hope no one offers me a hit while I'm drunk or partying in the future, it will be hard to say no.  Now I know why they call this shit `hippycrack.'



[Erowid Note: This is an update provided by the author]



After my last high I got intense body aches and stomach cramps/nausea a few hours after dosing.  Well, unfortunately these symptoms are continuing, although thank God in less and less intensity.  It has now been 5 days since my last dose, and my brain still has terrible foggy moments where I can't remember how to work the microwave, or forget what time of day it is.  For instance I was sitting watching TV at 2am and for a split second I looked at the time and thought it was 2pm, and I had an appt. at 2 that day and I jumped up and almost started getting ready, at 2am!  Just weird things like that.  I even put my shoes on the wrong feet for a moment.  I haven't done that since I was 5.  



I also have developed some new symptoms.  A tingling, bug crawling sensation on the surface of my brain, and mild headaches.  I'm still suffering from exhaustion.  I usually get up about noon, but lately I've been sleeping until 3, 4 and once 6pm!  Another new, very disturbing symptom is that my heart keeps racing and pounding so hard it feels like it's echoing in the room and everyone can hear it.  Fortunately it only seems to come at night, and during most of the day it goes away.  And the last thing, which concerns me, is that I haven't gotten my period yet.  I was due the week I started nitrous, and it still hasn't come.  I'm always very regular too, so this is strange for me.  I took a pregnancy test and it was negative.  So I wonder if the nitrous has affected all of my body systems at once.  



Well, I may see a doctor soon, although I sure as Hell don't want to.  But maybe I'll have them run some blood tests to check for a B12 deficiency.  Maybe they'll find it is just a virus, who knows.  



I really don't feel like it's a virus.  I've had no fever, no vomiting/diarrhea, no lasting soreness (like when it hurts to move your eyes around in their sockets, which I always get when I have a virus) and no one I've been in contact with is sick, or has been sick for months\ldots so I'm still attributing this to nitrous.  Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right\ldots I don't know.



I think the worst part of it is, is that nitrous had this addicting quality to it, for me anyway.  I have no desire to do it alone anymore, but if one of my friends hands me a pleasantly cold balloon filled with that sweet gas, I may just partake in it.  And what after that?  More stomach cramps?  Will they be worse?  Will it be the beginning of another binge?  It's kinda scary when I think about it.
