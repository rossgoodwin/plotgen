I had heard around the neighborhood that kids had been ingesting a plant called jimsonweed, also known as datura or angel trumpets. They spoke of cool visuals and strange thoughts. I had been told of a location where plants were growing, and decided to give it a try. Certain people who had experienced this plant warned against it, but after all the hype I wasn't going to miss out for anything. So my cousin Bob and I went to the spot and picked a grocery bag full of the prickly pods, which we had been told to open up and eat the seeds. After eating the seeds we became very sleepy, and our speech was quiet and strained. We felt extremely weak and couldn't stop yawning. We thought maybe we should walk around. We went to a nearby shopping mall, but quickly left because this plant rapidly started to consume us. 



Little did I realize that I was in for the ride of my life. (mind you I am no stranger to hallucinogenics, heroic doses, or bad trips.) I kept thinking that I had a cigarette in my hand, I even felt it there, but when I went to hit it, it had disappeared. I was having conversations with people who were not even there. It was like being absolutely asleep, dreaming, but walking around and talking. We hooked up with a sober babysitter, and he brought us to a pool hall nearby. What a disaster! Let me remind you that you have no real grip on the reality around you, you might get busted doing something outrageous and come back into reality for a moment, panic, and slide right back into the spirit world. Anyway, while at the pool hall I managed to chew on a piece of chalk, and take balls off the table in the middle of a game, walk across the room for some reason, and hide them behind a cigarette machine. My babysitter, Joe realizing that we were far more intoxicated than he had expected, escorted us out of the pool hall before danger of the law became a reality. Everybody in there was laughing at us, Joe said that we just looked really serious and confused. Actually, Joe should probably be the one writing this, for about 10 hours I can hardly remember anything. His story is far more detailed. Look kiddies, this plant is no joke. I don't think it would be going too far to call it extremely dangerous. At least when you're hallucinating off of acid or shrooms you can usually tell that you're hallucinating, on datura you're fucking delirious! I didn't really have a bad experience, but I wouldn't even think about doing it again. It's more fun for a sober friend to watch, I'm telling you, you have absolutely no idea what's going on. This is the shit that will have you jumping out the window! Peace to CLE!
