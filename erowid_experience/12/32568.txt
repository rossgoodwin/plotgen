For about 3 months prior to my first experience I had wanted to try shrooms very much. I had heard really great stories about them. Where I'm from however shrooms are really hard to come by, and my first experience was back when I didn't have very many hookups like I do now. There had to be at least 8 times where I was told that I would be able to get shrooms, and then the plans fell through. However on a Friday night my friend gave me a call telling me that he had chocolates and that he could sell me one with an eigth in it for \$35 which I immediately drove out to get. As I locked the door to my room I took out the Hershey kiss shaped tin foil that had smiley face stickers all around it.



I decided to wait until approximately 11:00pm before I would ingest half of the chocolate, which I did. I know everyone recommends being with friends the first time you trip, but I really felt I could handle it, which I could until I made a stupid mistake later on. I knew with it being my first time, and me ingesting only half of the chocolate that it would take some time before the effects would begin. After an hour I assumed that the effects were about ready to begin, but after another 30 minutes I began to worry. After about 1 hour and 45 minutes I started feeling some of the effects. Things in my peripheral vision began to grow and shrink. I really liked what was beginning to happen, so I immediately ingested the other half of my chocolate. I then laid on my bed, to wait.



Staring up at my ceiling, all of the hard corners had smoothed out so it looked like I was in a moon walk. As I breathed, my entire room breathed with me, expanding and contracting. It was very cool looking. After both half's of the chocolates kicked in, I had the right to say that I was officially `trippin my balls off.' The whole world was essentially melting. Everything around me was melting, growing, shrinking, waving, turning, and tilting and I couldn't stop any of it. I laughed at nearly everything around me. I decided to look at this electricity tube I have in my room, and it was so absolutely incredible that I fell to the floor laughing. 



On the carpet I realized that I started melting into the carpet. I couldn't define my body, but I knew that my body had become the floor and my essence was in the floor. Awaking from my daze I got up and staggered to this huge cushiony chair I have in my room and draped myself over it. Moving my hand across it, I began to melt into this also. Once again I could not find myself and assumed that I was part of the chair. Everything was amazing. My friend called my cell phone and as I began to talk to him, I could not find my mouth. I was talking into the phone, but I didn't know how and I thought my mouth was speaking from the other corner of the room.



After hanging up, I started playing with my hands, touching them together. My skin essentially melted into each other, it was a very odd sight. I then decided to go on the computer to find some trippy sites. I could not make out any of the letters on the keyboard, they looked like squiggles, and all of the keys were literally switching places. Somehow I got to a site, and stared at this awesome picture of a spirit with all of these eyes around him. I turned on some Pink Floyd and the picture started moving to the music. The eyes started rotating, it looked like they were dancing. I then got up, and decided to take a walk outside, since my parents were asleep. I saw my keys on the floor, but decided that I didn't need them since I would unlock the door. I quietly unlocked my indoor pools door and closed it. I then realized that I had forgotten to unlock the handles lock, and was very suddenly faced with the realization that at 3 in the morning, I was stuck outside my house, still tripping insanely.



My friend then called and asked how I like them, and he started laughing at me when I said I was locked outside. He wished me luck and hung up. So then I decided that something must be unlocked in my house. I walked all around my house, enjoying nature and all of the patterns appearing on the forest floor around me. I then sat down next to my garage to think about the situation. The trees all around me seemed to weave and dance, laughing at me that I was so stupid to lock myself out of my house. I decided to tell the trees to shut the hell up, and I went down to the pool, and tried the door again. I then sat down next to the pool and decided to call one of my friends to calm me down because I was very quickly descending into a bad trip.



Fumbling with my phone, in slow motion it fell out of my hand right into the pool. I quickly reached down, and with half of my body underwater I pulled my phone out. It was dead. I also drenched my nice coat and it was about 20 degrees outside. So I took off my coat and sat there. At about this point I assumed that I was going to die, being soaking wet with no phone or jacket stuck outside my house at 3 in the morning. I decided that being outside was stupid so I went to the front door of my house and rang the doorbell about 7 times before my sister saw me.



She yelled out `Mom its only Chris'. So they opened the door and my mom was yelling about me somehow being outside the house at 4 in the morning, and that they thought that I was a burglar so they had called security. They promptly called of security, and I told them that I was sorry and I had felt sick and needed to get some fresh air. I then said good night and started to go to my room when my mom called me back down. I then got interviewed by her for 15 minutes before I was allowed to go to my room. During this interview, her face was still melting and everything around me was freaking out. After getting to my room, I sat in my bed awake for the rest of the trip, dreading the next morning.



With all of the bad events that happened to me, I would not have traded that night for anything. That night is what gave me my love for shrooms, where I then went on to have a second extremely successful trip which I will probably write a story about later. Hopefully I have many more trips to come.
