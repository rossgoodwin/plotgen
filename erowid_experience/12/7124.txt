Trip report: 20mg 5meoDIPT, oral dose, $\sim$10mg 

insufflated.  Subject, male, 21, 160lbs, lots 

of psychedelic experience.



Hello!  I'm a brave chemical researcher, always

trying to push the envelope for the good of everyone.

Eh heh.  Actually, what I did last night resulted in

a great trip, but the route which I took was quite 

reckless!  Don't mess around with research chemicals 

unless you have a scale that can measure the usually

very small doses which you need.  A friend of mine, a

very magic lady, lent me some 5-MeO-DiPT

and I decided it was a must-try!



At 10pm I took what I had eyeballed to be a twenty

milligram dose of 5-MeO-DiPT, in a gelcap.  The amount of

powder needed was very miniscule, and I must take this

opportunity again to warn that these small amounts

really should be weighed precisely.  At about midnight,

I shook out a small amount of powder and divided it into

what I `thought' 5mg looked like.  I got two very small

lines, those of you into regularly snorting things would

not be satisfied with the size of these lines, but this

was no narcotic, this was a potent psychedelic!  The 

powder didn't burn much at all, and the small amount

of chemical taste in my drip was more than tolerable.

I had noticed effects begin to start a mere half hour

after dosing.  I had fasted the entire day except for

one or two light snacks, so I attribute the rapid onset

to this.  There was little nausea, just barely 

perceptable, but this soon faded as the trip began.

I determined to boost my effects and thus insufflated 

the small lines two hours after dosing.  Normally if

you redose on this chemical, the literature says you

have to take more, but I think that up the nose results

in a faster onset and better bioavailibility.  



At 12:30 the effects fully came on, with first a set of

low-hued visual distortions, followed by bright, 

colorful tryptamine hallucinations, very like what

one would see on the traditional trips, acid, shrooms,

morning glory, but much cleaner and more intense.  The

colors were really something, it was a continually

 shifting spectrum, the whole of my range of site

cycling the colors in response to some rhythem I could

not comprehend.  During this come up and plateau of 

the drug, I felt a few mind effects of tripping,

but overall I was very much in control at all times.



I am pretty experienced with psychedelics, and moreso

with with the OTC favorite DXM, so this may have 

something to do with the amount of control I maintained.

The visual distortions were really something else, fully

3-D bumps and ridges appearing out of no where, objects

swinging and flexing, etc.  At one point I stared

intently at my beige carpet, and was amazed to see it 

turn into flowing sand dunes!  



At about 3am I noticed a definent decrease in the

effects of the 5-MeO-DiPT.  At about this time I started

to smoke a lot of weed, and also began to feel the

body load come on.  I got a few cramps up in my abdomen,

like near my belly button for some reason.  That was 

the worst of it, other than a general achey feeling all

over, cleared up easily by ibuprofen. 



At this point, I actually started eating food!  The bong

had made me hungry, so I made several trips to the 

kitchen.  Because I think vitamin C always helps trips

along, I grabbed and orange and a slice of bread and 

devoured both in no time flat.  Then I went back and

got a pear, and then a banana; luckily we eat a lot of

fruit in my family!  I think my body preferred this

healthy snack over anything else I could have eaten, 

although maybe the majority of fruit contributed

something to my cramp, who knows.  



At 5:15am I was still tripping a little bit and getting 

mild visuals, so I decided to turn in, figuring I was

sleepy enough from being awake so long that I wouldn't

need a sedative.  I expected tryptamine insomnia tho,

and got my share of it.  The hallucinations with only

night lumination coming through my shaded windows were

very cool, with my shadows `freezing' in my line of

sight.  I tossed and turned a lot, mostly to try to

appease my cramped abdomen.  However by about 7am I

fell asleep, and woke up at 11:30am with the aid of

my alarm clock.



It's now almost two the day after,

and I still feel kind of muffle-headed and dizzy. 

Luckily I don't think that I really overdosed on this 

substance, and if I did, the OD wasn't harsh or totally

bad.  Since I weighed out my doses just by eyeballing,

a very risky way to do things, there's no way really to

say how much I took, although in my research I see

that the average dose is at the high end 20mg, and

at the insane end 40mg+.  This was a very enjoyable

trip, and I've never had visuals this good!  This was my

first real experience with a research chemical, and I

must say that I'm really impressed.  My hat goes off

to our country's chemists, always preparing new and 

exciting (and legal!) substances for the exploration

of conciousness.  I'd like to throw in my voice and

say that 5-MeO-DiPT is very enjoyable, and I'd like to see

more work done on this and other chemicals so that they

are more mainstream and safe and no longer need to be

`reasearched.'
