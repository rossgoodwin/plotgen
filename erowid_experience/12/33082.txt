It was a friday night and I had enformed a few close friends (L, S, and A coincidentally) of a nice mellow MG trip I had a few weeks back.  L was on a psychedelic hiatus after a bad mushroom trip but she decided it was time to get back into the swing of things. We had a relaxing day of smoking pot and joking around and the mood was quite relaxed. L came over to my house right after school but S and G were coming over later. Me and L went down to the store and picked up 17 packs of MG seeds for the three of us, G wasn't eating any.



When L and I returned we washed the seeds very thoughroly with dish soap and luke-warm water and, after deciding a water solution wouldn't be nessesary, chewed them up.  I ate 350 seeds while L had 250. Before we even finished chewing we began to feel high, but, after standing up realized we were just feeling very sick. We decided that a trip to the park to lay in the sun would be an excellent idea so off we went.



T:30M - Our whole bodies ache, our stomachs are turning with sharp pains at every step. The park doesn't help much at all, we sit for about 15 minutes clutching our stomachs in pain. L starts to talk about throwing up the seeds and aborting the trip but I tell her throwing up probably wouldn't stop the trip, as friendly and comforting as I could I said `It's too late man, just ride it out, the sickness will pass.' She agreed, for the moment.



T:55M - L is puking behind a tree in the park, she didn't have to, she wanted to. I feel significantly better but the body load still is quite cumbersome. We walk back to my house and settle onto the couch with blankets and start to get a bit goofy and giggly. The high is definitely coming on strong.



T:90M - S and G have arrived and S is eating his seeds now. L and I are extremely high in a strange sort of way. The visuals are there in a very subtle way, objects farther away distort and change - Bob Barker on Tv looks like a mutant walrus at times - while objects closer will shift and slide slowly. The mental effects are present but not prominent like they are on mushrooms. I am very clear headed and giggly but I'm in total touch with reality, a bad trip wouldn't be possible.  The body high is what is definitive of the MG seeds.  The body load is very strong and moving around is quite painful in my legs stomach and back; however, when sitting still, feelings of energy pulsing up and down my nervous system dominate the trip. I cannot tell where my limbs end or begin, I feel like a throbing ball of undefined senses. Sitting is very pleasurable and comfortable.



The night gos on like this for about 8 hours and me and L are still peaking. I had about 3 beers over the course of the night and this dulled my speech a bit but had no other really noticable effects. When the 10 hour mark rolled around I was increadibly tired but still too high to go to bed so we smoked several bowls of cannabis to ease us into that dreamy sleep state, which worked quite well.



Keep in mind I've been sitting down for almost the whole time so getting up and running up three flights of stairs wouldn't be the best idea. But that's what I did. I went up to fetch a blanket and alarm clock for L,S, and A who would be sleeping in the basement. When I got to the top I felt extremely light headed but I was determined to get these supplies back to my chums. I had the clock and was reaching for the blanket when L came up the stairs. My vision was starting to pulse and objects began to appear to be buzzing and coarsing with energy. I handed her the alarm clock and took one last step towards my bedroom door before I blacked out.



I woke up seconds later remembering nothing, L was over top of me asking `Are you alright? Are you alright?' I couldn't remember how I got on the ground but it seemed right, I was very calm and I slowly sat up and gave L a funny look, like, `What's your problem? I'm just laying here, jeeze.' I was very disoriented and my vision was still buzzing so I just sat there for a moment while L explained what happened while hugging me and smiling that I was alright, `You took a step and then just fell over into your closet, you started convulsing and making yelping noises.'  I was still much to disoriented to really absorb this so I nodded and tryed (unsuccesfully) to stand up. L ended up helping me into bed, tucking me in, and getting the blanket/alarm herself.



When I woke up my lips were throbing and after a glance in the mirror I saw that I had blood all down my face.  My lips were crusted with dried blood and they were covered in very deep gashes, from my convulsions I'm assuming. Stiches weren't nessesary but its been 4 days and I haven't been able to kiss my girlfriend yet.  Looking past the terrible ending of the night, which I contribute most of the blame to the head rush I got from running up the stairs, we all had a terrific night, the high was very unique and enjoyable.
