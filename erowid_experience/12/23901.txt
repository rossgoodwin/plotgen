Other datas:



- I was not on any other drugs at this time.



- I have no caffeine tolerance whatsoever.  I only once in a blue moon drink caffeinated beverages/coffee/tea.



- My only other full-blown caffeine experience was when I ingested 1000 mg orally.



- The reason for my tiredness throughout the experience could be due to the fact that I had slept very little the previous two days.

Experience:



t -1:30 I bought some Stay-Awake caffeine pills from the store up the street.  I didn't intend to use them right away, but to save them for final exams which were beginning the next day.  However, my impatience got the better of me.



t +0:00 - ***200 mg orally*** I took a single caffeine pill.



t +0:30 The effects start to hit me.  I experience a significant mood increase, and I feel a lot more energetic.  I decide to begin typing up a report that I have due the next day, and to my surprise, it's done before I even realize.  I'd like to take a moment to say that caffeine -does- work as an effective study/homework aid.  I must also state that I was feeling some slight nausea at this point.  It doesn't happen if I drink a coke or something, but caffeine in pill form seems to make me nauseous, especially if I take too much.



t +2:30 I feel the effects starting to fade slightly, and I want to get back to baseline.  I decide to go biking, thinking for some reason that it will help me get evened out more quickly.  I went home, and I was rather tired (even yawning, surprisingly).



t +3:00 - +4:30 I'm puttering around the house at this point, still noticing an energy increase and a willingness to do household chores.  However, I'm getting a headache, most likely due to the caffeine wearing off.  This is where the experience starts to turn downhill.



t +5:00 ***175 mg intranasally*** I'm sitting at my computer, somewhat below baseline, when a friend IM's me and tells me that I should try snorting a pill.  After some deliberation (I've never snorted any drugs before) I decide to go for it.  I crush the pill up with an ID card and my shoe.  I cut it up into 3 lines, one large and two small (I wasn't sure at the time how much my nose could handle) and took the large one.  A few minutes later, I took another one, and the remaining bit soon afterwards.  There was some minor burning, and the drip tasted disgusting, but it wasn't anything I couldn't handle.  The reason I state the dose as 175 mg is because I wasn't very careful measuring, and lost some on the floor/dust etc.



t +5:10 The caffeine I just railed starts to hit me in earnest.  I feel very jittery, and electrified.  I want to talk to everyone, and I have a definite mood increase.  One thing that I dislike about the experience is that I am -very- uncoordinated.  I normally type very fast and very well, but it seemed like my hands were made of ice (this could be related to the blood vessel constriction caffeine causes), and I was typing too slow for my brain.



t +5:20 - +6:30 The nasal caffeine experience, if I had to choose one highlight, had a much `cleaner' feel to it than the oral dosages I had taken in the past.  It was very easy for me to see when I was coming up, plateauing and coming down.  Another plus was that the nausea was more short-lived, and not the subtle, pervading kind that I experienced (and would experience again tonight) when taking large amounts orally.  .  It was very shortlived, and the high is not any more intense than when taken orally; it just comes on (and comes down) faster.



t +6:40 ***200 mg orally*** The high from the snorted caffeine is beginning to wane, and since I've gotten the crazy idea in my head that I want to stay up all night (bad choice number one), I decide to take another pill orally.  This is the last pill I will take tonight.



t +7:40 I start to feel the plateau from the oral dosage.  At this point, it's impossible to pinpoint which feelings are coming from which dose of caffeine, so I won't attempt to distinguish between them.  The nausea, which seems to still be present from my insufflated portion, combines with the newfound nausea that I'm experiencing from both the comedown of the original pill and this new one, and I come very close to vomiting.  Energy-wise, I feel like I've just woken up.  I know I won't sleep tonight, and decide to make the best of it.



t +8:30 After listening to music for an hour, I get up and use the bathroom.  To my surprise, this makes the nausea go away for a good two or three hours.



t +8:30 - +9:00 I try my hand at some meditation I've been practicing for a couple weeks.  To my surprise, the caffeine actually helps me concentrate on only my breathing, which deepens the process greatly.  This method also helps to eliminate some of the nausea.



t +9:00 - +14:00 I'm pretty much lying in bed for the next five hours, thinking and thinking.  I did not experience any `caught in a loop' thinking like I've read many people do when they take large amounts of caffeine.  The nausea comes and goes in waves, and I experience some heartburn.  For some reason, my stomach is growling very loudly.  I didn't think that caffeine would make me hungry, of all things, but I guess everyone reacts differently.  I would like to note that during this time I was very sweaty, although my room was probably around 70 degrees Farenheit, tops.  

                 

I also experienced what has become a trademark of drug use for me.  I (naturally) get very bored lying in bed, and I begin to have flashing delusions, and nightmares.  Although difficult to explain, it is a very discouraging and depressing experience.  The best way it can be explained is that the mind is so bored and over-stimulated it begins to create things that aren't there for entertainment.  This also happened to me the last time I took caffeine, and both times I consumed AMT.

 

I attempted several times to get some sleep, but it was completely impossible.  I was tired, but the residual effects of the caffeine wouldn't let me go to sleep



t +16:00 ***100 mg insufflated*** I believe I got about an hour of restless sleep, tops.  It was time to go to school and take exams, so I got dressed, took a shower and finally ate something.  The nausea subsided significantly.  Before I left, I quickly insufflated half a pill of Stay-Awake.  The burn and drip were much worse this time.  I also blew my nose on the way to school, and noticed that a lot of the powder was just sitting in my nose.



t +16:10 - +17:30 The caffeine is having a surprisingly intense effect on me.  I can't sit still in class, and I do the work very quickly.  I become much more sociable and assertive.  I also become more confident in myself, and give a presentation with great assertion.  However, with the intense positives, come the intense negatives.  The nausea is back, with a vengance.  After first period, I have to go to the vending machine and buy some chips and water to keep my stomach from sending breakfast back up.



t +19:00 ***200 mg orally***  Beginning my second period (We only have two periods a day now because we're on exam schedules) I sneak down yet another caffeine pill orally, under the pretense that I didn't want to crash and burn right in the middle of the exam that I had originally taken the pills for.



t +19:00 - +21:00 I blaze through the math test, and despite the almost unbearable nausea, the water that I bought before kept me through.  I was able to concentrate on the problems like never before, even lacking any real sleep from the night before.



t +21:00 - Present (+24:00) I've decided that I've had enough of an adventure for a while.  Coming down is surprisingly easy this time.  I believe I will definitely sleep well tonight.  However, there are more exams tomorrow.



This was probably one of my most enlightening drug experiences so far.  



- Once my tolerance goes down, I will insufflate one pill without anything else, to determine the effects of snorting.  My experience may have been hazed up by the oral administrations.



- The main drawback of this experience was the nausea.
