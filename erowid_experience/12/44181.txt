This is my first time with my new unknown `friend': 2C-C, and I must say it is one of the weirdest experiences I have had, and I am still wondering if it really happened at all\ldots \ldots . It is important to note that I don't own an accurate scale, and the dose I ingested was eye-scaled. I assume I ingested around 30-40mg. Looking back, it doesn't seem like a very smart move- due to the fact there's so little information known about this substance, and you never know how YOU will react to such a dose..



To the report:

--------------



12:30 - I mixed about 35mg+ in a small glass of water and drank it. I was warned about the bitter taste, but I didn't notice anything more than a regular chemical-bitterness. The taste was very similar to that of MDMA. No after-taste stayed in my mouth.



* Just about 1-2 min after I drank it, I noticed a weird wave of pleasure rushing through my brain.



13:30 - The only thing I could notice was an odd build-up in my forehead, with no nausea or any discomforts around my body. Though I didn't know exactly what to expect, I was feeling very calm and looking forward for it to kicking in. 



14:00 - Noticable effects are very hard to pin-point. I was sitting very comfortably on the couch watching TV, feeling relaxed mentally and physically; yet no visuals whatsoever. Perhaps I was looking the wrong effects?



14:30 - I was wondering if it was going to kick in at all. I thought about increasing the dose, but my friend stopped me from taking more and advised to continue waiting. 



15:30 - Still in the weird build-up phase, I was feeling very much like my `normal' self, yet I could sense something was there.. This feeling followed me during the whole experience. This `There, but not really there' kind of feeling, which some people called `tripping without tripping'.. No negative feelings though; I felt very good and absolutely nothing bothered me. My head felt `empty' in a way, and I didn't think about anything if I decided not to. I found this mind-relaxant effect very efficient for psychotherapy purposes for treating depression or dealing with stress.  



16:00 - Very sensational feeling all over my body- a hard feeling to put in words. I noticed some visual distortions, such as faded bright coronas surrounding everything around the livingroom and a very mellow breathing of the walls. Unfortunately, the visuals stopped as fast as they kicked in. I noticed the build-up in my forehead was slowly turning into a headache, followed by tension in my neck area. I tried to avoid thinking about it as I knew 2C's may cause headaches and/or weird pressures in the body.



17:00 - At this time I could tell I was on something. Sitting outside in the garden felt beautiful and very relaxing. When the warm wind was blowing all over my body, a rush of tingly overwhelming pleasure rushed through me. I remember looking at the sun through the trees, which were moving very calmingly with the wind, and seeing many colors pouring out of the sun. Extreme euphoria. We smoked a couple bong rips of cannabis, which made the effect of the 2c-c increase in intensity. And yet, I was feeling very normal at the same time..



18:00 - Increase of senses; colors and objects looked very vivid and bright. I also saw light trails. Feeling lazy and comfortable on the couch again, I had an urge to nap but could not sleep. I had no sense of time (it felt much slower) and I found some difficulties with the memory (eg. I couldn't remember clearly what i was doing before taking the 2c-c, I couldn't remember what i was doing just a few minutes ago, etc etc.). The headache and neck tension were increasing as well. I suspected the headache may have been caused from not drinking enough water, or not eating enough. We ate some pizza, and I had no nausea at all. After I ate and drank some water the headache

decreased for a while, but came back even worse after about 15 minutes. my forehead was a bit warm felt like it was expending with blood. I will also note that on the peak (around 2.5+ hours from taking it), I had some difficulties talking and following basic conversasions. my head seemed to be going somewhere else while i was trying to hear what was said, yet I still didn't feel

like I was tripping.



19:00 - At this point, I couldn't tell where the whole thing was going. Was it going up? Was it coming down? The headache felt horrible, very much like a bad migraine. I had to just lay down the whole time because walking or getting up off the chair provided great pain. I was avoiding taking any kind of painkillers and kept drinking water.



From around 20:30 the effect was appearing and disappearing randomly, and I was extremely annoyed by the headache. At 1:00am I showered for a very long time (or at least for what felt like a very long time). Even drying my hair with a towel

was extremly painful to my head. I entered my bed still feeling odd and in pain. Falling asleep wasn't too hard, and the night followed by very odd and vivid dreams. I slept very deeply, waking up at 11:00 the next morning feeling fresh. By that time my headache was gone completely and I thought to myself `thank god this one is over.' I smoked a couple pipe hits of cannabis, and could feel the 2C-C hitting back in its own peculiar way.



Overall, it was a pleasant and a fun experience, despite the horrible headache. I am still wondering what caused the headache, but I'm quite sure it was from lack of hydration. The next time I try 2C-C it will be probably mixed with LSD.



I am not disappointed by the experience, but I think I was looking for the wrong effects in it. 2C-C is a very sensational trip with visual aspects at high doses. The sedating feeling is very similar to MDMA or Benzodiazepines.   



extra notes:

- Few days after the trip, I still have some visual disturtions.

  LSD like visuals such text morphing (especially on the computer screen), and object morphing (extreme bending visuals especially late at night). I suspect its from the 2C-c because it is the only substance I have took in the last 2 months. 



Be safe and enjoy!
