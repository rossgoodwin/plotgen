Last night was my first psychedelic experience in my life. The first mistake was probably making DPT my first experience. Let me just say right now, though, that nothing bad happened. The second mistake was getting impatient and deciding to not use a sitter, even though I know that one is absolutely necessary. And finally, my dosage measuring technique wasn't the most precise (a toothpick dipped into the vial and the drop going on the foil.) Despite my mistakes, I had an interesting time. Fun is not the proper word for this substance, I realized that immediately. 



I was doing this all in my room, so it was a very comfortable place for me. I had just finished a long day of martial arts practice, so my body was a little sore, but that wasn't a problem. I was a bit nervous, but a few minutes of deep breathing before the experience calmed that. On my first attempt, I didn't get enough smoke, and barely got threshold effects. I decided I wanted more, so I repeated the process, and this time I got my timing down and I managed to inhale all of the smoke, or at least most of it. I held it for as long as I could (20 or 30 seconds) and was definitely feeling different after about 5 seconds. By the time I exhaled, I was pretty much gone. This being my first drug experience I was in absolute awe at what I was seeing. You can read about it all you want (which I definitely did, for about a year), but nothing can communicate what it's actually like. There were patterns forming on everything that had a texture, and everything without a texture was just kinda waving about slowly. I had Pink Floyd's Wish you were Here playing, and the body vibrations that I had read about with this substance were somehow in sync with the synthesizers of the music, very intense. 



After what seemed like about 5 minutes, but was probably a lot less, I started feeling `myself' start to slip. I would look at the carpet and the patterns would engulf me. At one point I was just lost in this room of colored spirals, with no real knowledge that I had done any drug at all. I snapped out of that a little, and went to turn off the lights, and then the same thing happened. I don't know how long these two events lasted, my guess is about 20 minutes. At this point, the music had changed. It was more upbeat and far less trippy (I think it was the song Have a Cigar) and it really agitated me, so I went and turned it off and let the steady sound of the cars on the highway calm me back down. There was still a very prevalent body vibration, but it felt quite good, as a lot of it was concentrated around my groin. This continued for a while, and by the time I had more of my wits about me I started going off in thought, thinking about my day, my life, my friends. I realized that if this was what tripping was like, it definitely wasn't something I was interested in doing very often. Maybe others react differently, but I can't see myself doing this more than just a few times a year, if that. Finally, I realized that the only real reason for me doing this drug was curiosity. That wasn't necessarily a bad thing, but it seemed like there could have been so much more to it if I had had a purpose. By the time I came down completely, by about 12:30, I was just blown away. The afterglow left me a nice pleasant and contemplative state of mind, and I drifted off into a light sleep, waking up at about 6:00 this morning and then dozing until 11:00. 



All in all, it wasn't a negative or bad experience, just a bit overwhelming for me. I get the sense that this is one of those substances that floods you with things and then gives you the next few months to figure it all out. If I do it again, it will be at least a couple of months, and I will certainly have a sitter, if only so I don't have to clean up after myself while I'm tripping. I'd also like to try it with no distracting music, I feel like it sorta disrupted the flow of the trip a little bit.
