I was desperate, curious. I had never done any type of drug before, and I wanted to make sure all went well. I couldn't get my hands on anything illegal, and I wanted to experience hallucinations.



I decided to try these motion sickness pills. They contained Dimenhydrinate, which is supposed to get you high. I waited for my chance: I was going Upstate, New York in a couple of days, and I knew that my grandparents would never suspect a thing. Once they were out of the house, I knew it was time. I was a bit worried: How much do I need to feel its effects? Possible side effects? Allergic reaction? DEATH? The night before my grandparents would be out of the house, I wanted to take a precaution. I took 3 50mg tablets, and waited. Nothing, except I felt slightly tired, and I fell asleep. Next morning, I knew, would be fun.



I skipped breakfast, after hearing eating before taking a drug would minimize its effects. Here's how it went down:



10:30 a.m.- I took 8 pills, each with 50 mg of Dimenhydrinate. That's 400 mg. I didn't want to take anymore, because this was my first trip ever, and didn't want to over do it. I managed to get them down with a cup of soda. I didn't feel anything but a very, very slight stomach ache. This went away after about 10 minutes. I decided that I would listen to my music. I listen to progressive rock, and today's choice was Kansas. My grandparents STILL haven't left, and in case I did anything stupid, I left the house and went on a trail, that would lead me to a small creek, where I just liked to sit and relax. I sat down, sighed, and waited for the promised effects.



11:45 a.m.- I was listening to my music when all of a sudden, I see a light flash before my eyes. I blinked stupidly, trying to see if it was a trick of light, or an actual hallucination. It happened again. I shook my head. After all, I was sitting by a stream of water, and maybe it was just reflected off of it. Disappointed, I decided to walk home. My body was a little tired, and basically I felt blah. But my music sounded much clearer, and I felt like I was addicted to the sounds. In my mind, I would visualize these sorts of colors, to match the mood of the music. My mind worked blissfully. But I was still looking forward to the hallucinations.



Noon- I'm now on the main road. Flowers grow abundant were I'm walking. My body starts to feel heavier, and my music seemed to grow louder. I stared at a flower, when all of a sudden, a bee darts straight towards my face! I threw my hands over my eyes, and shivered. You know when you have an adrenaline rush? It felt just like that, only it seemed to me that the reaction was delayed, and fear strangled my heart, but only for a moment. I would use the term `pain' to describe it, but very loosely.



It happened again. This time, I dropped my CD player. I picked it up and ran back home, my legs like heavy globs of jelly. I was almost back to my house, when I decided to walk again. Out of nowhere, a big black hole appeared in the ground. I jumped over it, and fell to my knees, frozen in shock. I giant mosquito was hovering over me, and all I could hear was its buzzing. I screamed and ran back, like a frightened puppy. It was a big mistake going outside.



1:00 p.m.- I was much calmer now, sitting on my couch. I had decided to read the newspaper, because boredom was staring to sink in. I opened the page and all I could see was squiggles of black, coated with a fine layer of fuzz. Its exactly like when I just wake up, and I have to blink a few times.  I rubbed my eyes in vain. I couldn't read anything. I ate my lunch, a grilled cheese sandwich, and decided to watch TV, hoping for better visuals.



1:45p.m.- My body now was totally heavy, I could barely stand walking, and I tripped often.  It's like I had 50 pound weights attached to my ankles, and arms that were like cars speeding. When I finally got them to move, I had to `brake' them with all my effort combined. This phase eventually passed, about after another hour.



2:45p.m.- I was slightly buzzed now, and my body was functioning about 90\% normal. I still couldn't read, strangely enough, this `fuzz vision' only happened when I looked at objects close up. I was a little bit mad, I wanted a totally out of body experience, and I felt I had taken too little of the pills. I went to my room, and swallowed 7 more, waiting patiently.



3:50p.m.- Nothing really happened this past hour, just another wave of tiredness. I had started to feel really, really thirsty, and got a bottle of water. I just happened to look at the window when it started to ripple. I was gazing at this for a couple of minutes, when it stopped. This was the last of my visuals.



4:30p.m.- I started to feel all heavy again, and now I felt light-headed whenever I stood up. `Fuzz vision' was becoming a nuisance, as now I couldn't read the words I was typing on my computer. I turned it off and just sat on my bed, listening to Kansas.



5:45p.m.- I was feeling very, very sleepy and dozed off in my bed. This was the end of my trip, except I felt more tired then usual the next day.



The Verdict-. All in all, it was a good first time, although I was still a little mad I hadn't seen as great of visuals as promised. Its a great drug for newbies, since these feelings aren't overwhelming, and it can be enjoyed without any nasty side effects. Except I had a very dry mouth for a few hours. Nothing a little water can't cure. I would definitely do this drug again, as long as my parents were out of the house.
