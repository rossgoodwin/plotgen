I have had interest in psychedelics and these newer `research chemicals' for quite some time. I read many trip reports, and discovered and read as much info as I could on 5-meO-dmt. Then one day after reading some more reports about it, I decided that it was my turn to experience the `terrifyingly orgasmic'(a title of a trip report, and probably the most simple way to describe it) chemical. I ordered 100mg from an online research company. I was looking for an experience to give me insight, or some kind of a spiritual connection I have been looking for, and wisdom, not to get high. I was excited, and nervous about trying this new chemical. I am experienced with a few psychedelics, like acid, xtc, pot, and salvia d.



I made a simple, vaporizer type thing, by wrapping foil around a pencil and then carefully shaping a `bowl' for it. Then, the moment came. The package arrived. I anxiously opened the package. It came in a tiny ziploc bag, as light brown, flaky crystals. It smelled odd, a friend told me it smelled like new shoes to him. I waited until night to try it. It was difficult loading these somewhat sticky, damp crystals into my pipe. I took a business card, folded it in half to make a crease and took a bend out paperclip, and scraped the crystals onto the card, then into the pipe, very carefully. I took a few deep breaths, and briefly meditated. I estimate my first dose was about 5mg. I held the flame under the foil, and gently inhaled. It didn't taste bad, not like burnt plastic, but a plasticky taste was noticeable on exhalation. The threshold effects felt like nitrous, with a touch of acid. I was plesently suprised with a great body feeling, like warm, flowing energy. My thoughts remained unchanged, unlike with most other psychedelics I have tried. I heard a slight buzzing noise, and I also could feel this noise in a physical way. I received no visuals at this dose. I had a slightly faster heartbeat, and looking in the mirror I saw that my pupils were dilated. The body buzz lasted about 5 minutes, then gradually diminished over the next 10 minutes. I felt very excited to have such a chemical in my possession. I felt a great urge to try a bigger dose, but I waited until the next night. 



I decided to double the dose, to approximately 10mg. I loaded the pipe, and took a hit, trying to hold it in for a long time. The effects come so quick. I felt like I had an electric current flowing gently through me. I connected this feeling to the buzzing noise I heard. There is a rising peak, where I experienced the feeling of `Wow, this is amazing'(the physical feeling). I did have some slight, acid like visuals this time. I felt dissociated, like floaty, but my thoughts were not really affected. My heart was racing, and I did feel a slight panicked feeling, like adrenaline flowing. After the first minute of rising effects, the feeling seemed to turn into more of a stoned feeling, the feeling of the `void', emptiness where my thoughts slowed, along with the buzzing feel. It lasted probably 10 minutes, and I felt `speedy' for another hour. I was impressed, but still felt I needed to explore the higher dose range. The next day I experimented with a low dose (around 5mg) with a friend. I put some in the pipe for him and he hit it. He laid back and said, `that tastes weird', then his pupils dilated. He exhaled and had an anxious look on his face. I asked him how he felt and he said, `my body feels fucked up\ldots I feel kinda speeded out.' 



I didn't try it for a few days after that, I was saving it. Then one night, (last night), I decided it was time to try a serious dose. I put on some Pink Floyd music, which played quietly in the background. The setting was my bedroom, on my bed, where most of my previous experiences have been (this was, I think my 5th time doing it). I had the pillows arranged so I could either lay down almost flat or have my head propped up. I placed what I think was about 20mg into the pipe, and set it down. I did some deep breathing, and focused on the relaxing music. It took me a few moments before I was completely ready. I lifted the pipe to my mouth, lit, and inhaled. I could taste it pretty clearly this time. It did not taste bad, just a little weird. Its hard to put what happened next into chronological order or even describe it exactly, but I'll do my best.



I felt an intense rush, a feeling of sudden movement. I felt panic, my heart was going so fast. I began to think I was dying, but remembered that this feeling is normal for this drug. That was the first 5 seconds. I then saw amazing visuals, which I cannot clearly remember, but I do remember everything in my room melting, bending, and floating around. I am not religious, but I felt an inner presence, trying to escape. This feeling is impossible to describe, terror would be the closest description. My thoughts shattered into nothing. I lost sense of self, and my environment. Its not that I didn't know who or where I was, it was absense of conscious thought. Absence of time and ego. Everything seemed to darken. The visuals were still present, intensely. I laid down flat and took deep breaths. It was as if I was experiencing something truly amazing, a once in a lifetime thing. The terror faded some as I entered into this void. The empty feeling started to get replaced by consious thought again. An understatement is I was amazed. I cannot describe the power, and the feeling, no one can, completely. I was happy to be alive.



I had the `rebirth' feeling as other reports mention. I was in a state of ecstasy at the comedown, a great happiness that I had just experienced this, and lived through it. I was still tripping hard but I call it a comedown compared to the extreme effects of the peak. I looked in the mirror and smiled at my suprised, `wow' look, and very large pupils. I started gaining normal thought back. I would compare the coming down similar to a 100mcg trip on acid. The peak experience is not like acid at any dose, or any other drug I can think of, besides the slight resemblence to N2O. Its in its own category, like salvia is. 



It has been about 25 hours since the experience, and I am still feeling unsettling thoughts and anxiety about what I had experienced. I feel a need to analyze this trip. I would recommend a sitter for this drug since it is quite mind blowing, but I don't think I could move during the peak. I will probably experiment with this again in the future when I am ready again. I don't feel there is much to learn from this chemical in a spiritual way, it is a kind of a stoning drug as Shulgin described it. It is much more than that though\ldots
