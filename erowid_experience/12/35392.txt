I had been wondering what the effects of Mysticrine (Nutmeg), and after carefully studying various experience reports and vaults, decided that I wanted to experience it for myself.



Setting: 2:20 AM, sitting in my apartment by myself

Mindset: Somewhat energized, happy, curious



It was a Thursday night, and after work I had a few beers and smoked a joint with some friends.  Shortly after that I arrived at home. I had the next couple days off work, and wanted to try the nutmeg.  I decided I would simply put some water in my mouth, throw a tablespoon in there, and wash it down with more water. This actually worked excellently, although finding the right balance is tricky.



T+15m

Ingested another heaping tablespoon



T+20m

Ingested another heaping tablespoon



T+23m

Smoked a bowl of pot, no affect other than normal



T+25m

Sense of sound is heightened, starting to feel a little bit strange



T+30m

Ingested another heaping tablespoon



T+35m

Just had a nutmeg burp. Nasty. Definatly feeling something, like being really high on pot



T+40m

Ingested another 1/2 tablespoon



T+1.5hrs

Very tired, feeling a slight buzz. Decided to go to bed. When I fell asleep (almost immediatly), I had very vivid dreams. They were all really bizarre, but one of them I will never be able to forget.



I was living in a city that looked like it was from ancient mesopotamia, except instead of being made of clay bricks, the buildings looked like they were constructed of grey playdough. Everything was really strange, I couldn't see peoples faces, only shapes of them moving around. There was only red light, it seemed to come up from the ground all the time, but very dim. The clouds in the sky were looming just above the city. At that time, I didn't even realize that it was a dream. I had actually forgotten completely about what reality is like. After running around the city, completing my daily tasks, I went home to bed. I lived in a small room in a playdough building, with only a bed and room for my belongings. 



When I went to sleep within my dream, I could feel my spirit leaving my body and rising up, through the ceiling, up towards the clouds. Above the clouds was a strange white grid, which my spirit passed through easily. I was then in the upper layers of the atmosphere, looking out into the night sky. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a bright white light, and began moving towards it. As I got closer, it turned out to be Colonel Sanders, the white light was his aura shining so brightly. I was totally baffled at this point, and I felt very uplifted, and connected to the universe. Then the Colonel began talking to me. I can't remember exactly what he said, only what he meant my all of it. He told me to keep going, keep pursuing my dreams and that everything was going to be good in the end.



I don't remember what happened next, only being awoke in my own bed by someone at the door. I could barely open my eyes, it felt like I had smoked an ounce of pot in my sleep. I drifted in and out of sleep for a couple hours, having very nice lucid dreams. When I finally got up, I made breakfast and parked myself in front of the TV. I knew at that point that nothing would get done on that day. 



Another thing, I had major munchies all day, and nutmeg burps. No matter how much I ate, I couldnt fulfill my hunger. By the time I went to bed that night, I was feeling pretty normal though.



In summary, I think it was a great experience and would highly reccomend it. After a few hours of trying to interpret my dream, I came to a conclusion. The playdough mesopotamia I was living in, represented our civilization. Colonel Sanders represented the Divine being, God, call it whatever you want. The basic message I recieved from the experience is to keep doing what I love, and that even though alot of people look down on how I pursue plant allies, continue using them to follow a spirtual path.
