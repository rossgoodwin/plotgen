All week long I'd been wanting to have some kind of experience, so last night I weighed out 25mg of AMT into a capsule and put it aside.  I took it immediately when I woke up this morning, at 9:00am.  I had planned on also taking 500mg of DXM two hours into the AMT, but I ended up not doing that.  Here are the notes that I took during the trip:



9:00am - Took 25mg of AMT, oral.  I last ate about midnight, so it's on a relatively empty stomach.  Hesitated for just a moment before swallowing the capsule - my last experience with AMT was not much fun.  I since decided, though, that I had overreacted to my last experience and that I would try AMT again, at a lower dose (my last dose was 80mg).  I plan to take 500mg of DXM at 11:00am.



9:45am - When I get up and walk around, my movements have a vague `floaty' quality, like I'm weightless.  I'm definitely feeling the AMT start to come on, but primarily in a physical rather than a mental way.  No nausea yet, thankfully.



10:05am - I'm getting strong physical `rushes', a lot like those from MDMA and LSD.  The effects are still body-centered rather than mental, but it's beginning to affect me mentally as well - it's getting hard to focus on anything, and about twice a minute I'm experiencing short hypnotic pauses, where my mind just goes blank for a few seconds and I stare off into space.  Nausea is beginning to be noticeable, but it's still manageable.



10:20am - I'm now in the characteristic AMT mindset; it's something of a paradox because I'm feeling strong stimulant effects, but there is a pervasive calm overlaying it all.  Since I'm capable of writing this, my thought processes are obviously still clear, but it is certainly affecting me emotionally - it's sort of like having a warm, soft blanket over me, but in my head.  Perhaps in connection with my last experience, where looking out my windows at the forest outside helped calm me during a difficult experience, I'm finding my thoughts drawn repeatedly towards trees.  I've moved since then, and I now live in a major city, but luckily there are still big, beautiful trees right outside my window - it was one of the reasons I chose this apartment.  I'm very grateful for them, and right now I feel an emotional connection to them.  This is not actually unusual, because I used to go for long walks in the forest and talk to my favorite trees; this wasn't drug-related, by the way, I was sober when I did that.



10:40am - The physical rushes are very strong now, almost like electric shocks.  When one hits me I shudder violently, and it's intensely pleasurable.  I force myself to drink some water, which I don't want at all.



11:00am - This is the point where I had planned on taking the DXM, but I review my state of mind and decide that I'm happy with where I am right now.  The AMT is presumably at its peak, because the effects are neither increasing nor decreasing in intensity.  At this dosage they remain relatively subtle; I know that I could handle myself just fine in a public place, and that I could interact with others without them knowing that I'm intoxicated.  The effects are not anywhere near overwhelming, but I'm enjoying them and as much as I like disassociatives (and I do) I just don't feel like that type of experience right now.  I decide to revisit the idea of DXM in another hour.



12:00pm - I'm no longer feeling the emotional aspects of the AMT, and the stimulant properties have come more to forefront.  The calm that I felt earlier has been replaced by a speedy sort of restlessness.  I feel a generalized and constant `hum' throughout my body, which reminds me of a car that's idling.  I'm feeling strong urges towards compulsive behavior like tapping my fingers, biting my lip, pulling on my beard, etc., which I try not to engage in but sometimes catch myself doing anyway.  The drug shifted gears on me abruptly - just a few minutes I was content to lay in a darkened room and mull things over my head, but now I feel like I have to be doing something.  I'm still not interested in taking the DXM.  This has been a good experience for me, it sounds a little corny but it's helped me re-establish a positive relationship with AMT.  The combination of AMT and DXM is something that I will probably try in the future, because I think it has the potential to be pretty interesting, but since I have large quantities of both substances I don't mind taking my time to explore them.



2:00pm - Not much change, still feeling strong stimulant effects.  One physical complaint, though: I've had a lot of back pain throughout the experience, and it's continuing to bother me.  I'm 6'8', so it's not unusual for me to have back problems, but I haven't had any in about a year and it's strange that I'm having them now.  It may be related to the general muscle stiffness that I've experienced every time I've taken AMT.



3:00pm - The comedown is relatively gentle, but not exactly fun.  I have that ubiquitous metallic tryptamine taste in my mouth and I feel worn out and spent, but I can't sleep yet.



That was the last note I made.  It's 8:00pm now and I feel a little lightheaded and extremely tired, but mostly normal.  I'm glad that I decided to give AMT another try.
