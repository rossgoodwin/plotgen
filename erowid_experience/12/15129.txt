Substance - 2C-I



Experience - First time



Setting - my house, solo



I was in a mediocre state of mind. I had just had a rough night at work. It was 1045pm and I looked at the capsule containing 16mg of 2C-I in it. I quickly down it with a swish of Code Red Mountain Dew. I then sat back to play the waiting game.



I had fasted for about 6 hours before this point in hope to make a swifter comeup. My stomach was rumbling with hunger.



1045PM - 16mg ingested orally



1050PM - I feel a tightness in my stomach. I had not read anything about naseau so I asked fellow IRC users. They said it was the phenethylamine signature. I myself had never had a phen of any sort so I wasnt sure of this. But I dismissed any alarm I had.



12AM - Feel alert, I also feel\ldots  itchy is the only way I can describe. Much like a feather is being rubbed gently all over my body. A very pleasant body feel.



1210AM - No visuals present, but I am starting to come up fast. But still the effects are not too powerful, I could still function should I need to.

I was speaking to a person whom I go to for advice, and he said that I should try to smoke a little to boost it more. I had read of smoking 2c's and heard it was quite gentle. I decided to try 5mg to see if it did anything at all.



1215AM - Vaporize 5mg of 2C-I in a test tube.



1220AM - I go back on the computer. Smoking definitely boosted the experience. My body high is tremendous at this point. It feels almost as tho I was having an orgasm throughout my body. It actually makes me shudder every few mins.



1AM - Slight visual disturbances. Things seem to be far away or real close. Depth perception means nothing right now.



130AM - Still coming up, very strong body buzz, but still very gentle\ldots  



My previous experience with AMT had been rather bizarre. The body buzz was strong and made me feel weird at times. The 2C-I feel, although definitely bizarre in its own way, was very gentle, and I never felt out of place.



2AM - I think Im peaking now. Visuals are powerful. Slight patterning is present, but only slight. The real visual effects are that my entire vision looks as though I was looking through a piece of bent glass. Everything is very warped, and glistening. 



At this point I can hear my parents stirring in the room next to where I am. I dont think I would handle a visit from them well, so I retreat to my basement where my room is. 



215AM - I go into the bathroom to look in the mirror. I love mirrors on trip, they are so frightening and so fun at the same time. Anytime I made a happy face, my skin seemed to change color, and I looked absolutely beautiful. I was the best looking person that ever lived. But when I made a sad/angry face\ldots  my face warped and contorted, and took on a greenish hue. My eyes seemed to sink back and my teeth seemed to look like fangs. I dismissed this as a hallucination though and left the bathroom.



216AM - On the way out I notice we have a whipped cream can in the fridge\ldots  hmmm\ldots 



218AM - I suck down the nitrous. Holy shit, what can I say?\ldots  I was literally nullified from this world. I saw bizarre images pouring through my head while my body separated from me. I felt as though I was completely and utterly lost in a sea of color and thoughts\ldots  for about 2 mins hehe



220AM - Nitrous is over\ldots  wow\ldots 



230AM - Put on headphones and lay on my bed. Listening to Dark Side Of The Moon. People tell me its cliche, but I still love it. Always puts me in a positive mood.



245AM - Listening to Floyd and watching my room breathe with slight patterns still flowing  



3AM - At this point my mind was gone\ldots  I had random thoughts I had never thought before (and now cannot recall) pour through my head. With my eyes closed I saw images dancing behind my eyes. It was a powerful vision/thought.



315AM - Still watching visual effects\ldots  I have found that if I resist\ldots  no matter how intense it gets, I can seem to suppress all the effects. But for the most part I am allowing the chemical to take over and do its magical work.



430AM - Coming down now\ldots  still feeling great. The body orgasm is STILL there. This was the greatest body high I have ever felt from any substance I have taken. Visuals are still bending around the room.



5AM - I try to force myself to sleep\ldots  not a good idea\ldots  Trying to push all this out (despite what I said before) is too hard. The more I try to sleep, the more intense the CEVs get. After awhile of trying I give up and just lay there.



530AM - I hear a crash\ldots  I go upstairs and see that my cat knocked a vase over. I pick it up. I then go into the bathroom to see the mirror again\ldots  yep, Im still having strong hallucinations.



545AM - My stomach is hurting now, its been about 12 hours since I ate. I pour a bowl of cereal and eat it. It tastes so very good. I turn around and open the blinds, and I witness the most breath-taking site I have ever seen. The sunrise\ldots 



I had only seen the sun come up a few times before, but now, while on 2C-I it meant so much more. It symbolized a new beginning. It was at this point that the eye of my mind opened widely, and I just about fathomed everything I had ever wondered about, revelations about my life were flowing through my head, making me so very happy.



And then I hear footsteps\ldots 



My mom comes down wondering why Im up at 545. I said I heard the cat and then I wanted food. She sat down with me and started to talk to me about random stuff. Eeek\ldots  I do not enjoy talking to my parents on any drug, let alone a hallucinogen\ldots 



Time to try if I can push it\ldots 



Yes! Its working\ldots 



6AM - I managed to get through the convo. And then she asked me to drive out the get the morning paper. Shit, I thought. I cant drive like this. I was still tripping, not nearly as hard as before, but still enough where I would never drive. I say I dont feel good from lack of food, and she goes out.



615AM - I take a shower. Oh god, how wonderful this feels. I look at the shower curtain, and it is breathing. Its been 7.5 hours since ingestion, and Im still seeing visuals? Wow\ldots 



630AM - I go on IRC. To my surprise people are still on and active. I talk to them for a bit.



8AM - Effects seem to have left me completely, a total of 9.5 hours after ingestion I feel normal  



What a great experience



----------------------------

Side effects - I had read of a raise in blood pressure. When it all wore off I had a tightness in my face, and my jaw hurt from clenching. I was tired from lack of sleep, but that was to be expected. 



The effects on my mind were fantastic. I have never had a more introspective trip in my life. This had everything I have ever looked for in a drug. From the fantastic visuals, to the nice body feel, to the completely blissful mind this was my best drug experience to date.



In the future I think I will try smoking 2C-I by itself to see how the effects of that go.



2C-I was a very powerful beautiful chemical. Please treat this one with respect.
