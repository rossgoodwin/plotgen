First off this was my first test of salvia divinorum. I had read the information on how it works and how to dose it. I was at a friends house and had been telling him about salvia and its history. We had planned on getting together that day and trying the new Salvia that night. The day went well and I was able to show my friend some basic info on the salvia plant from an online source. He agreed with me on taking precautions with this stuff. We had taken no other drugs or medications in the past 24 hours, so we were clean. Our only preperation was to have eaten something to start the digestion process and to have a drink ready to keep hydrated with.



We were both set and had divided up the single gram of Salvia Divinorum into our separate doses. He got 0.40 grams and I got 0.60 grams (I did buy the stuff so I got the larger portion). We went to his living room and sat on the couch. He ate his first. Now the traditional way of ingesting the salvia is by placing in the mouth and chewing it for 5 to 30 minutes. This is difficult due to dry salvia leaves are very bitter. He decided not to chew but rather pop in his mouth and wash down with an energy drink. Needless to say he felt nothing the whole night. Now it was my turn. I took my salvia in small ``bites'' so as to keep the bitterness from getting to severe. After each bite I would drink some juice to wash the leaves down.



The salvia took about 20 to 30 minutes to start to work noticeably. I ate mine because I believe it works better and lasts longer that way. First it started off with me feeling relaxed, not tired just loose. Next I started to laugh about things more and I don't mean just pointless pothead laughter. Funny things, like jokes, were funny and others were laughable. Now I am about 45 minutes into the trip. This is where the providers say that the effect is at full strength and it stays that way for another 1-3 hours.



So loose, funny, and now I can't talk as much or focus on what is going on. I am drifting from one to another instance with the trip leading the way. Now when I said can't talk I mean I can talk but I can't focus enough to care to talk about anything. I feel heavy and limber when walking and sitting. I can hear what is going on around me but I can't care to focus on what is said or done. I am so happy and calm that the fact that I can't do much doesn't scare me at all. I am practically immobile and unable to speak and I am just there with it. So I get myself over to a chair to sit in for the rest of whatever happens. I couldn't follow time until I was done with this trip.



I looked around the room and saw something so interesting I just sat and starred at it for ever. I was looking at my friend's computers screensaver. It was a black background with weaving and twisting water pipes all over it. The pipes had white bubble spots on them. Every so often the pipes would move towards the screen and then just shoot up to the top of the screen, it looked like the pipes hit me and even felt that way too. No pain though, just felt them touch me and move. I watched this for a long time, I don't know how long it really was though.



When I was done with that I looked up at a mirror picture on the wall with sparkles on parts of it. The sparkles were glimmering in the light and started to move back and forth. Getting closer then backing off, always changing. This got to me like and itch on my brain and so I stopped looking at the mirror. I turned towards the wall immediately and began feeling things touching, more bumping into my body. I could visualize these three dimensional shapes of gray color floating along in space and bumping into me. There were cubes, pyramids, tetrahedrons, all sorts of shapes just floating and bumping into me then bouncing off in another direction. I couldn't move myself to block them or push them away so I tried using my mind. They started to move as I wanted and do what I ordered. Some just exploded into shards others would move near me and I would think ``other direction'' and off they would go in that direction.



Later on I got a little tired and was able to move enough to lean back and rest comfortably. Before this my eyes had been open the whole time so it was granted to rest them. I only slept for a little while though because when I awoke I was pretty much over the trip. Anyhow, while I slept I remember one thing; my hands disappeared. I was somewhere very dark and then my hands were gone, at the wrist, as if I had never had any hands. I couldn't feel or see them or even remember them or what they looked like but something very familiar was missing in there place. I woke abruptly and pulled my hands out of my sleeves where I was keeping them warm. I looked at them and felt them and rubbed them and clapped them to see if they were real and mine! I took some time in doing this kind of stuff over and over making sure this was real and bringing back the memories of how to use them and what they do. It took about ten minutes for that to end and then I felt fairly ``sober''.



The trip was quite noticeably over. I felt much clearer and was able to stand and walk very confidently now. I decided to take the precaution and not drive home for another 20 minutes to be sure I was back to normal with a little extra knowledge on my side.



In total the experience was very pleasant. My friend said that I had a smile on for the whole 3 or so hours after taking the Salvia. He also added that when I tried to walk I never actually stood up but rather would look like I was trying to get up and then just sort of blow the idea off in a huff. I don't remember trying to get up for anything though. Still he said that my state resembled being very intoxicated yet under control.
