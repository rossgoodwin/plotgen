First, a little history. I take 16mgs of buprenorphine (Subutex) daily, along with 1mg of clonazepam (Klonopin) and occasionally take cyclobenzaprine (Flexirel) or clonadine (Catrapress) for sleep. I take the clonazepam at night usually around 9:00 PM, so I had not taken it this day and did not take it until after the drug wore off because benzos impede the effects of MDMA. My friend takes Subutex and Zoloft. SSRI's can drastically reduce or eliminate the effects of MDMA. I had taken it with him once before and while I was floating in the clouds, he was barely feeling anything. So this time we took twice as much.



At approximatly 7:00 PM my friend M and I snorted 200mgs of MDMA. It was in a crystal form, and from the looks, taste and effects I would guess it was near 100\% pure. Upon insufflating, I could taste the salty, sassafras taste of true MDMA and could feel it burning through my mucous membranes.  Within 5 minutes I could feel a rushing sensation, almost like I was overdosing on coke. It was actually unpleasant and within 20 minutes I remembered why I usually eat my MDMA rather than snort it; the onset can be too intense. When I take MDMA first I feel stimulant effects, which gradually subside and get replaced by feelings of empathy and euphoria. We dosed in my friends basement and left to head home, a 20 minute drive. \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#  A few minutes before we got home we stopped at the pharmacy to get syringes and cigarettes. When I walked into the pharmacy I was shaking and became overwhelmed by all the colors and the change in lighting upon entering. I felt like I was on too much speed. I purchased the needles, M got his cigarettes and we left.



At around 7:30 we arrived home and I went to my room and put on some music and sat down to relax. The uncomfortable rushing sensation started to go away and I began to think that maybe I wouldn't end up rolling because I had rolled off 100mgs a few days before. However, prior to that I had not taken MDMA in about a year or more, because it was not around. I also wanted to take a year off to `get the magic back.' Well after a half hour of listening to music, I started to feel that familiar love and contentment that makes me love this drug so much.



At about 8:00 PM ``The Great Destroyer Remix'' by Nine Inch Nails started playing on my computer. I suddently felt an overwhelming urge to get up and dance. M was upstairs with his kids and I was downstairs by myself. I got up and pretended I was at a Rave and danced like crazy. After about 20 minutes of dancing I decided to do some Subutex. I have a nasty habbit of injecting the stuff so I began to prepare a shot. While trying to carefully prepare the shot, I kept feeling like I HAD to dance because the music sounded so good. I got up to dance while I was still in the middle of prepping the shot because it was so uncontrollable. This is one of the things I love so much about ecstasy\ldots. Appreciation of the arts is increased tenfold.  



At about 8:30 I injected 2mgs of buprenorphine and lay down to feel the drug take effect. Bupe has a great synergy with MDMA, and just about any drug for that matter. My body felt so good, I just wanted to lie there but at the same time I wanted to get move around because everything and anything felt great. I started thinking about my life and how I need to stop shooting my pills but it didn't cause me to become upset, I simply accepted it. I have a problem and I need to find a solution, no matter what it takes. Because life is too precious to waste and if I do not stop this it will kill me. 



At 9PM I walked out to the road to meet a friend and trade him an 8th ounce of pot for 300mgs of MDMA. I did the trade and returned home to give the MDMA to M. He said he was feeling really good but needed to do more. So he went in the bathroom and did another tenth. Shortly after I asked him for a hit of weed. We eached smoked a hit and then M went to bed. I didn't know how or why he wanted to go to bed, I assumed he wasn't rolling as hard as I was because he takes that awful Zoloft and I went downstairs to enjoy my high in solitude. A few minutes after I smoked the weed I was tripping! Weed always gives me closed eye visuals, but when on MDMA it is intense. I shut off all the lights in my room and listened to more Nine Inch Nails. Their music is perfect for this drug. I put on ``The Great Destroyer Remix'' again and once again felt an uncontrollable desire to get up and dance. The music gave me such joy and the lyrics made so much sense. I always hear music in different light when I'm rolling. Lyrics that were meaningless before take on new meaning. After an hour of dancing I was tired and lay down and tripped out. I was the happiest I'd been in years and was having the best time I've ever had on MDMA (without LSD anyway). This was the second best MDMA trip I'd ever had, only second to the first time I candyflipped (MDMA+LSD). 

At around 11:00 the effects were dwindling so I scrapped all the resin out of my pipe because M was in bed and I didn't have any weed. I smoked the weed and it boosted my roll. For the next hour I just sat in my chair, overwhelmed with how good and felt. I realized I was 2 hours past my daily Klonopin dose and decided not to take it, because I wanted the MDMA to last as long as it could. I felt that I really needed this experience, as lately I have become very depressed because my life is so mundane these days. I felt like after this I would have the motivation to do the things I need to do, like get a job.



By midnight I was definitively coming down so I put on a movie, ``The Abyss'', and just lay down and rested. After the movie was over I was all done rolling, so I took my Klonopin and a Flexirel and went to sleep. When I woke up this morning I felt fantastic, just like I thought I would. I suddenly had the motivation to find a job, so I put on my shoes and jacket, and ran out the door to go downtown and apply for jobs. Today I applied for more jobs than I have in the last 2 months. I felt refreshed and happy, like the MDMA gave my brain a much needed `reset'. It is now 10:37 PM, over 24 hours since I took the MDMA and I still feel much better about my life than I did before I took the drug. Long live MDMA.
