So booze is legal and everyone does it, maybe its not as exciting to think about as other drugs, but a drug it is. I had decided to get drunk, very drunk, to see what it was like. Somehow, regarding the booze as purely a drug and not just a drink made it more appealing.



In the weeks prior to this event I had tested the water, as it were, by getting mildly drunk a few times, on various drinks. By mildly I mean so that I could easily control myself still, but could fall into the drunkenness if I let myself go. I researched alcohol and its effects, both mental and physical, learned about it, and decided that I would go ahead with getting completely drunk.



The friend with whom I intended to get drunk with had been drunk before but never to the extent we intended to be. We looked around and found prices of different sources of alcohol, looking for the cheapest price per amount of pure alcohol. 



I bought a 750ml of whiskey from a local shop and hid it in my bedroom until I was going to use it. During this time I sampled a small amount of it, perhaps 30ml, not much at all. I found that it tasted very bad, but drinkable.



One Friday evening my friend's parents had gone out so we decided to get drunk then. I went round to his house and we got straight to it. I was feeling a lot of excitement and anticipation for what was to come. Everything felt good and right to do it. This was 2 years ago so times will not be quite accurate. At about 6.30 we both drank half of the whiskey, which was about 360ml each. That is about 80\% of a pint. I downed it all in one go to make it easier, but it still burnt my throat terribly. I almost threw up into the sink, but held it in. The desire to vomit quickly passed. My friend drank his and we washed the glasses and put them back. We went and watched TV and just hung around his house for like 15 or 20 minutes. We decided to go out and walk around the streets for a bit. We went out and walked and talked, and went to like the centre of our suburb. It was pretty quiet, not many people were around but it was very warm and light still. 



We were wondering when we would feel anything; it had been about 30 mins already. It was suggested that we go and buy some more, but instead of turning down towards an off-license we continued on walking. We went into a supermarket and looked at the alcohol, considering whether or not to buy more. About that time (T+45mins) we begin to notice some effects. Just a feeling of happiness and well-being. Jokes brought about a lot more laughter than usual. So we concluded that we wouldn't need any more booze, and continued walking on. The effects came on quite rapidly after that. The happy feeling increased, and everything felt fun to do. If I let myself go I could lose some physical control and start to stumble, but I could still pass as sober if I wanted to.



We headed back towards his house, cutting through a graveyard as a shortcut. Here we began to fall about laughing in the grass, not caring where we were. From here onwards my memory is a bit sketchy, but I will tell what I remember.



We made it back to his house, he walked up his drive and got to the door and I was behind him and kind of ran into him, we both laughed and he pushed me and I stumbled and fell through a high wooden fence separating his house from his neighbour. The fence collapsed on top of me and I crawled out. The neighbour came out and I seem to remember apologising and helping him stand the fence back up. I then ran out into the street and back into my friend's driveway. I have a clear picture of running back towards his house; everything was black and white for a moment.



Inside we fell about, knocking furniture over and such, it was all very good fun, and everything felt great. I remember that several times we would try to get through to each other, saying ``Sober! Sober!'' For a few moments we could drag our rational minds out of our drunken state and communicate seriously about what we were going to do, but it was like holding a heavy weight; very soon you had to drop it and we would return to acting like fools.



We headed for his parent's drink cabinet, and drank an unknown amount of other spirits. I remember we drank a lot of amaretto between us. My friend dropped the bottle on his fireplace and broke some tiles. I think maybe we broke a table in his house too.



We went back outside, where it was still light. We went and called at the house of this guy we used to know. His mother answered the door, and we managed to act sober -- he wasn't home anyway. We walked around a bit more, it was like watching the world through thick glass. Not because my vision was obscured but because I was just a spectator in what I was doing. I think we may have been talking far too loudly, as someone looked at us rather strangely from across the road. I had an urge to hit my friend, I don't know why. I kept hitting him playfully on his arm, I wasn't in control. I really remember very little past here. I'm pretty sure we went back to his house for a bit. 



After that the next thing I recall is being in a local park which is about equidistant from our respective houses. It was dark so some time must have passed. I estimate it was about T+3 hours. We fell around on the grass, no one could have seen us so it was ok. We tried to break through again, ``Sober! Sober!'' which worked for even less time than before. My friend had to get home before his parents did.



I woke up in the park and he was gone. The next maybe 30 minutes were spent waking up in different places around the park, trying to walk, and then just waking up somewhere else. I have some flashes of memories of walking home. When I made it home my parents were in the kitchen. My bloodshot eyes were noticed, and then my behaviour, and basically I got busted for the whole deal. I don't like to recount this part of the evening, as it is the extremely bad part of the whole memory, the first half being extremely good.



I threw up soon after getting home. The next morning I was still a bit drunk, but had no headaches or aversion to light as is traditionally felt after a binge on alcohol. I was sitting in my room that morning when I imagined the almond taste of the amaretto I had drank. The taste was vivid and real, and I again vomited. I had previously liked an almond flavour, but even to this day I am not entirely comfortable with it.



Being found out by my parents was an intensely uncomfortable situation, and no one ever mentions it still. It was an awful end to a truly great evening. 



It would have been wise to have a non-participant with us that night, so prevent us from doing anything dangerous for example. I do not in any way regret the experience, indeed I am extremely glad I did it. Since that day the alcohol I have drank totals about 3 glasses of wine. I haven't really drank since, nor do I intend to in the future because unless I want to get drunk, I have no reason to drink it. And I have not felt any real desire to get drunk again, mainly due to health and fitness interests. Recently however, my interest in drugs has been rekindled and I intend to get drunk to a similar degree sometime soon, just to remind me what it is like.
