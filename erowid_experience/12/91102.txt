Dose - 15 mg ACO-DMT  ('K')

       20 mg ACO-DMT  ('V')



850 pm - drank powder dissolved in water

910 pm - felt a heavy vibration, palms sweating



We sat on a couch , holding hands, that's when we noticed our palms were 

sweating. Indian raga music playing on stereo.DMT like visions with 

closed and open eyes.



K--I entered into a golden realm with a bright deity present, who said 

very clearly `Not with him' which snapped me back to the awareness of 

sitting on the couch. I asked V `What does that mean?' And V, 

flabbergasted, twisting and turning,said `What do YOU think it means?'  

My response was indignant and I wanted to go after the entity that had 

said this to me!



V-I was deep into the music and felt like I was entering a sacred realm. 

Suddenly I got to a point where I was being told where this realm and 

music is only for those entering with a single heart and pure love. I  

could go no further till I had expressed my pure heart. I took K by the 

hand and said let's go lie down on the bed. We cuddled and preceded with 

our trip.



K-Upon cuddling, I entered into a beautiful moving colorful oneness with 

V. I sensed V taking my hand, approaching a golden being, where he had a 

conversation with it, requesting us to enter together into the entryway 

beyond the being.V pulled me into the entryway, where we became as one 

and back into the beauty of the oneness with V again. I was loving this 

so much and I said to V, this is so beautiful, where are you taking me? 

and V responded , `That's what we're going to talk about..'



V-I confessed/explained that my heart was not int the same place as K's 

and that I had to be 110 \% honest before we continued this journey 

together. K told me to chill out and relax and we continued to embrace.



K- I went back into a huge golden space that the entity had permitted us 

to enter, it was beautiful but I as I went further into the entryway,  I 

came upon the essence of some kind of accident/ train wreck/distortion, 

preventing me from going any further. Very clearly, I was now told to 

listen and be quiet. I was not permitted to speak..However, I was 

blurting out things I was not suppose to say, and constantly reminded to 

be quiet at least four times.I.I perceived V to my left as a golden 

being on a throne,and to my right was the entryway with the being 

inside, I was dressed all in blue, veiled, with bangles all over my 

dress. I was in a realm of intense blues and golds.I laughed at V, and 

said `You will not be my God!' V, angered said `You will laugh when I 

tell you to laugh' I responded with silence.



V- I remembered saying to K, I like to hear her laugh, it is interesting 

that she heard it a completely different way.



K- in my anger, I now possessed a staff in my right hand and I went into 

the chamber where the entity was and proceeded to tell it that it was a 

false god and that Jesus  was the real God and that he had created 

everything, including them. I raised my staff and struck the being and 

it vaporized. I did this repeatedly with many entities, I was angry and 

like a warrior princess archetype. I was now thrown back on the bed, 

noticing how I would go in and out in waves. V and I were astonished at 

how beautiful we both looked to each other and commented on it. and we 

cuddled and kissed\ldots even with all the ongoing craziness of it we still 

had a love for each other.



V-We had some intense conversations on our relationship and due to my 

personality and her religious beliefs that there were some 

irreconcilable differences. K pointed out some very astute observations 

on what my problems dealing with woman were. Boy, did she nail me! These 

were some valuable insights. I realized and said that I was like a wolf 

stalking his own heart .We also discussed our very different spiritual 

beliefs. This took place over a span of  several hours as we would 

alternate intense conversations as the effects of the drug ebbed and 

flowed in waves.



K- I would drift back to the beauty constantly, but I could only go so 

far until I encountered the vision of a trainwreck. This happened four 

times, I didn't want to face it and on the fourth time I realized that 

the trainwreck was V's relationship with me..and I was now trying to fix 

it.



At 5:30 am the most intense parts had passed, sleep was difficult,so we 

both took Xanax.We were both shocked at waking up at 5:30 pm on the 

next day !



V- Basically this was an incredibly potent substance, but like MDMA I 

believe that this has strong empathogenic and therapeutic properties. We 

both joked that we had saved thousands of dollars in therapy bills!



K- With the right person, the person you love, this could be the best 

experience of oneness one could ever have in this lifetime.
