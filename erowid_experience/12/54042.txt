So, I was relaxing at home, abut 2 AM. on an IM (instant messaging) service, I started talking to E. At the time, I was pretty awake. I knew I had an exam the next day, but falling to sleep at this time, would most certainly render me unable to attend the exam. I ask E if he has any ideas to keep me awake. He Mentioned 2-Aminoindin. a research drug I had taken before in about a 60-80mg dosage. So, believing (and experienced enough to know) that it was a stimulant, I decided to go for another dose.



2:30 AM: E arrives, we head up to my abode where we conversed for a while about experiences Alex had with the drug previously. Hearing nothing more than only slight negativity, and many positive points, I decide to take the dose. (100mg remember)



2:45 AM: the dose is down, and I'm drinking water as per normal.



3:00 AM: Started to get bored waiting for the come-up. I decided to have a few `Shotties' ('bongs' to those unfamiliar with certain lingo)



3:30 AM: the Dosage kicks in. my legs go numb as per the previous experience. Things feel fine, but a bit drowsy. Taking this as a sign of tiredness, I go downstairs and make 2 extra-strong cups of coffee. At this point I was not feeling stimulated in the way I thought.



5:00 AM: We start watching `garth merenghi's dark place'. And I start to sniff poppers. Whilst sliding out of my chair and giggling at a doctor doing a front flip with a baby, a sharp pain appears in the back of my head. Not liking it, I asked E to move off the bed so I could lie down. As soon as my head hits the pillow, the rest of my head starts to pulse with pain. Each beat of my heart sent agony into my head. I start to writhe on the bed, wondering what is going on.



5:05 AM: E starts to get freaked out by my actions. I knew his voice was calm, and relaxed. But to me, it sounded like he panicked. I start sweating profusely. The pain searing through my head and the sweat trickling off of my face started to make me panic. I stand up and as I thought. I threw up. Luckily, into my hand. But also into my shoe. I run to the bathroom. Lift up the toilet seat, and start the long process of seeing what I had to eat that day. With the feeling of a jackhammer crushing my skull, the sweat going down my face, and with the vomit spewing through my mouth and nose, I wasn't really having the greatest moments of my life. In fact. it was possibly the worst feeling I've come across.



5:10 AM: still sat in the bathroom, I have E checking up on me, whilst I try to take off my vomit-soaked clothes. The feeling I had was certainly outlandish. My body was being put through, what seemed like torture and my mind was still in a state to clearly capture it all and remember. 



5:15 AM: I go to get some air outside, rushing down the stairs to prevent throwing up on the carpet again. I sit on the porch step, look to the sky, sigh, lean over, and throw up to my left this would be my target for the next half hour. E comes down with cigarettes and hands me one. I lit it, took about 3-4 drags, and threw it on the floor, and the same with yesterday's lunch of Sausages in brown sauce.



5:30 AM: the air around me starts to chill my body deep. I cursed the sweat that had started to dry on my skin. E grabs a bucket from the garage, and we head back in.



5:40 AM: I go back into the bathroom, and ask for some music. Amazingly enough, I managed to pick out the band, album, and song in one thought. shortly after though, I threw up.



5:41 AM: hold on\ldots since when did machine head play so fast?



5:48 AM: I head to the main bathroom to wash myself off. I pass out on the floor for about 20 minutes and wake up with a towel over my head



6:41 AM: it occurs to me that time seems to be moving quickly. The gap that was an hour seemed to be merely 10 minutes which probably explains why it seemed that E was nagging, when he must've only been asking about once a minute. Also, at this time, the only thing coming out, when my body tried to eject the contents of my stomach, was merely the now-foul-tasting coffee.



7:00 AM: I finally have the energy to get back up and lie on the bed. Still feeling like shit, I arrange things around me for best use. pillow..check. bucket\ldots .check. that's all I really needed.



7:00-8:00 AM. E talks to find out what I'm feeling like. He makes sure I'm okay, and he heads on his way home.



8:00 AM: I turn off my computer. The damn thing made so much noise. All this did was make my mind concentrate on the pain in my head.



9:00 AM: my mum walks into the room and asks me about the exam. `it's only voluntary' I replied, just to send her out the room. She shortly after, accuses me of alcohol abuse and says she's disappointed in me.



4:50 PM: I wake up. no nausea only slight head pains. But also very span out by the whole ordeal. I walk downstairs, open the front door, and pick up the cigarette I threw there about 12 hours ago. I light it back up and walk back up to my room wondering what the hell happened.
