Before I start, let me say that I think that I probably handled this experience as good as anyone could hope for, and it was still a horrid waste and MUCH more unpleasant than I was hoping would be possible in a worst-case turnout. It was enough to forget about the possible good effects and abandon the drug totally, just to avoid the risk of repeating this experience ever again.



To start off, I am an avid DXM user, very comfortable with my own mind in various states. I was looking to try LSD, but where I live, right now, it is very dry. One night I decided to try morning glory seeds. I figured that at best, it would be a new experience that would further my understanding of different states of conciousness and provide me with a nights amusement. At worst, I figured that I would have a bad experience that I would get through.



It went for worst. After picking out several packs (500 seeds worth) of Heavenly Blue morning glory seeds, my friend and I went to his house. I washed the seeds off in a bowl with dishwashing liquid, and my friend pulvarized them in his coffee grinder. We then mixed it into a bowl of applesauce (I was amused at the concept of magical applesauce), and I scarfed it down. The taste wasn't unpleasant at all, especially compared to the gagging that ensues from just thinking about the taste of cough syrup. It was a nut-like taste, not pleasant, but not really bad. I just got the applesauce down quickly and didn't worry about the taste.



I had a plastic garbage bag on hand in case of vomitting, and it turns out that was a good idea because as soon as I knew I was going to puke, my head was in the bag. I wouldn't have made it to the toilet. I can normally stomach cough syrup, so I am used to controlling my stomach. This still took me. I continued to wait, only feeling a bit better from puking. Nothing happened, and after a while, my friend and I decided to go to sleep because the drug obviously wasn't going to do anything. I was feeling pretty uncomfortable at that point, and as I got under the covers, it intensified. My legs began to move against the covers, and it felt like some form of internal itching that would only go away by moving my legs. It spread to other parts of my body, but mainly stayed in my legs.



My mouth was salivating under my tongue and, though the taste of the seeds wasn't bad going down, I tasted them under my tongue in my saliva, and it was very unpleasant. Drinking something or putting something in my mouth would only make this go away for a short time, before it would be back. I laid in the bed and stared at a poster on the ceiling, somehow hoping that the seeds would do something eventually. In the darkness the image on the poster seemed to shift a bit, and sometimes regions would fade and the poster would dissappear into the wall completely. It was VERY minimal, and I'm not sure if it was even the drugs at all. Not interesting in the least.



I was somewhat tired, and it was about 2 or 3, but I couldn't keep my body from moving around under the covers. The unpleasant body feeling grew stronger and my legs began to spasm periodicly, a bit at first, and then more and more frequently until my legs were spasming every two seconds or so. My arms would sometimes spasm too, especially if I directed any amount of attention whatsoever to a particular muscle.



I got up and went back to bed several times. It was one of the most unpleasant experiences ever. I wasn't worried at all, I just wanted to get through the night. It was aggrivating to be in a helpless state of twitching. I couldn't stop the spasming if my life depended on it. If my friend's dad had walked into the room, I would still be kicking and jerking my arms. It was terribly retarded looking I am sure. The spasms made it impossible to attain sleep, which I wanted more than anything so that I could just finish this ordeal. My stomach at this point was wretched, and my mouth tasted horribly dry and yet filled with seed-tasting saliva. I had the very uncomfortable body sensations going on and every second or two another limb would jerk itself. Without being able to stay still, there would be no way of getting to sleep. I laid on the bed and thought a lot. Mainly about how horrid the entire situation was and how much I just longed to get through it. Several hours later, I finally was able to drift off, but woke up several times and went to the bathroom.



The next morning, I became conscious in steps. At first it was like I had awakened, but I still was unaware of a body. I felt my conciousness in a non-void. I didn't feel like I was anywhere, but I didn't really feel like I was nowhere either. It was like my spacial perception was just not happening at the moment. It was dark. The ONLY thing I became aware of was a strange feeling. It wasn't pleasant, but it was manageable. I didn't know what the feeling was at all, but I knew that I could make it feel better if I just willed it to. I don't know why I didn't will it to feel better, but I am oh so glad that I didn't. Slowly, I became more concious, and finally awoke sort of dazed and quite a bit disoriented. As I woke I realized that the sensation that I had felt was my bladder, and had I relieved it, I would have pissed all in my friend's bed. At the state I was in, I probably wouldn't have even realized it until I woke up from peeing on myself. I'm sure that would have been a very embarrassing experience.



I felt totaled, horrid to say the least. I still spasmed, but it was a bit more controllable now. I could sometimes keep it down to a minimum, and for short periods, stop myself from spasming completely. My stomach felt raped and my body in general was in a pretty sad state. I was going to go home, but as I walked to the van in the garage, my stomach unkindly let me know that I really meant to be heading to the trash can to vomit. I puked my insides out. The smells from the can were wretched, and it was all I could do catch myself from gagging and dry-heaving long enough to request something to vomit into besides the trash can.



At this point I had specks of vomit on my pants. I was in no condition to go home to face my mom, so I went inside and got the vomit off my pants with a wet towel. Since I was very noticably wet, I decided to go with my friend out of town to score some weed instead of going home. My mouth tasted disgusting and my body was feeling quite lower than I have ever felt. I was completely torn up from the entire experience.



After several hours, mostly driving with a short stint at the dealer's house while we waited to finish the deal, I returned home and spent the rest of the day in my room lying down. I didn't sleep, but I was physically and mentally exhausted and could only rest the remainder of the day away. It was a relief after the previous night's unpleasantries. It has been a few weeks since the experience, and although the initial `God-that-sucked-I-am-never-ever-going-to-try-that-again' period wore off, I can still say that the lasting impression of the experience is far more than enough to keep me away from morning glory seeds for good.



I did not get a trip at all, and I spent the night in utter discomfort, and the next day trying to recover from such a punishing experience. It was enough to keep my mind off of drugs completely for the next few days. I made it, but anything I gained from the experience I would gratefully give up for the chance to have not had it. I am sticking to my regular drugs until LSD comes around. This has certainly convinced me that waiting for acid with nothing is not the worst thing that could happen.
