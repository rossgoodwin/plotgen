Well, every two weeks there is this huge event in a network of arches (basically tunnels) under a bridge somewhere in London. I can't name it for obvious reasons, but it's basically ONE BIG TRIP. It consists of a weird, acid-induced play, a few chill-out/trippy/gallery/art rooms, and a huge network of dance floors playing booming trance, ambient, techno .etc. The whole event is a sort of tribal gathering, decked out with various psychedelic forms of art to add to your trip (in one particular room, they were spinning some kind of flourescent spider web for the entire 24 hours) There is a stall in one of the rooms selling every psychoactive drug under the sun (provided it was legal, or relatively legal(whatever that means)), and one particular evening I was particularly hungry for that type of thing. I went over to the stall, intent on buying some magic mushrooms (I had heard they were particularly good, but had not yet tried them). I bought 5 grams for £20, and as they were small English liberty caps, I happily munched them all away in about ten minutes. 15 minutes later I had a joint, and stage one of the trip began.



It started as a really relaxing and pleasant trips. Colours danced and disappeared, passed through skin, and twirled around my head. Music was visible, floating through the air in spirals and circles, almost touchable. I was watching the play at the time, and everything that was said seemed to mean so much to me, sometimes even directed straight at me. I was transfixed, amazed by this new world I was entering, and was furiously chewing the sleeve of my shirt. Time passed and didn't passed - minutes passed me by like hours, and stage one seemed to last so long. Stage two began when a friend of mine left, and everything became more intense. Geometric patterns appeared everywhere, and faces were moving and warping in ways I had never experienced on shrooms before. I began to write down thoughts and quotes from the play, but the pen I was using seemed to be doing it all itself, the ink flowing uncontrollably from the metallic tip. I could not focus my attention on any one thing, everything was so powerful and interesting. Sound and light and taste was so beautiful, even touch, when I held a cigarette, was a magical, different sensation. Then the walls began to move, convulse and change shape - holes appeared and disappeared, colours melted and reformed, shapes danced to any sound that I could hear. i felt trapped, enclosed by a pulsating organ - I had to get out, especially since I really needed the toilet. But for some reason I forgot why I had left the theatre and found myself by the mushroom stall again preparing to buy yet more mushrooms (How stupid can somebody be, man!) In my hand, I had a water pipe, from which I had smoked a gram of Salvia during stage 2 of the psilocybin trip, one book on Tudor England, another on European history in the 16th century, and a normal dope pipe. Don't ask me why.



Suddenly, I felt something horrible, somebody's legs twitching against mine. It was an acquaintance of mine, somebody who had come with me, in the middle of a seizure. The mushrooms were too much for him, and his body had given up trying to cope with what he was seeing. (the next bit is pretty nasty, so hold your stomachs!) Suddenly a fountain of orange vomit errupted from his mouth and poured itself all over his face. He got up instantly, completely out of his trip, not knowing what had happened, and wondering what the hell was all over his face. His body had expelled the psilocybin, unable to deal with the utterly intense power of the trip. The rest of us entered into the next stage, the stage of complete and utter terror. I remember repeated over and over again `Bad Karma, man, Bad Karma!' I had to leave. All the people who had taken the mushroom were experiencing the same thing, the same intense terror. The crowds became one big, overwhelming entity, standing against me. I don't remember what happened next, except that I ended up in the toilet, feeling trapped and claustrophobic. My urine left my body like it was terrified too.



As soon as I had finished draining myself, I rushed out, even more terrified than before. I was greeted by a juggling friend of mine, who began to juggle and immediately lifted me out of the pit I was in. If you have ever seen contact juggling, you will know what I mean when I say how amazingly beautiful it is. When I was satisfied, I left him to find some water. Things went bad again - everyone was against me, laughing, pointing, trying to kill me. I reached the water tap, and drank as much as I could, but the taste was unimaginably bad. When I looked around me, It looked as if I was standing a lake of putrifying, horrible water - I was drowning. I ran, followed by my friend and found back in the theatre. I found another companion, and sat down, ready to experience the visual power of this incredible trip in more relaxed surroundings. My mind was lost and found, tumbling and holding on. The play became my trip, it controlled how I felt, what stage I was in. When something was going wrong in the play, something was going wrong in my trip. Faces deconstructed and reformed in different ways, like a picasso painting. Some people, who were clearly experiencing just as intense trips as me, seemed to be home to maggot, hundreds of maggots writhing under their skin, stretching the skin in the most distressing way. This continued for 5 more hours, before I could leave the theatre and get something to eat. My body was completely drained, but I felt gratefully, almost euphorically happy. I would go back the following fortnight, and experience the whole place again. Another world in the middle of the metropolis that is London.
