Repeated `museum doses' 4-aco-mipt, plus caffeine [Editor's Note: at the time of ingestion, the author believed the substance to be 4-AcO-DiPT, see Follow-Up Note at the end of the report.]



\#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SUBSTANCE\_ID\_QUESTION\#\#



35 Year old male 86kg  



Religion: Neo Pagan- Wicca 



Meds: None 



Alternative Meds: 333mg St Johns Wort (standardised extract 1000mcg hypercin), Vitamin tablet (100\% RDA of all major Vitamins, plus some minerals), Fish oils 600mg (All taken daily, AM)



Previous experience: Including the following, LSD, Mushrooms (liberty cap), 2c-x of various types, others including unknown pills, mdma, various amphetamines and 4-aco-dipt. 



Reasons:  Having had a full blown experience with this compound, why not explore it at the opposite end of the spectrum? I've experienced the same doses before, but the intention here is completely different. This isn't the build up to a high dose, this is taking time to see what if any subtle effects there may be at low doses. I dreamt this plan up while contemplating my breakfast, faced with a day of sitting at home (see set and setting below)



Set \& setting: Frankly I'm bored, stuck at home waiting for a utility to send someone to change a meter. They give appointments by the day, and could visit any time between 8am and  8pm. Sometimes they don't show up at all. I'm stuck here for the duration. On the plus side I'm at home, comfortable, and have any amount of toys to play with.



Preparation: Not much, I'd already done the morning routine. I'd eaten a breakfast of oatabix, and a cup of freshly ground coffee.



Drug identification: Certificate of analysis was provided with the substance indicating $>$98\% 4-aco-dipt, method unknown at this time. The powder was measured on a laboratory scale, +/- 0.1mg accuracy. The powder was dissolved in distilled water to give a concentration of 10mg per ml. Doses were then measured using a calibrated measuring pipette. The combined accuracy should be (much) better than +/- 1mg. 



T+00:00 I take 10mg in water, along with a second cup of coffee. The taste of the compound in no way compliments the coffee. The taste is bitter and extremely unpleasant, and hangs around for a good time.



T+00:10 It dawns on me what I have done. I've just taken a compound that I have previously used to `smash my brains out' fully expecting to have to deal with `real people' at some unknown point, possibly in the very near future. Yes there is some fear there, quite a bit of fear. I realise fear is not a good emotion to be embracing right now, but it's got me. For a time I think of trip aborting meds, and cancelling the appointment. The trouble is I have to take time off work, and who knows when the next appointment will be with the Christmas holidays.



T+00:30 First alert. I am not so happy at this point, normally I would be looking forward to what is to come. The fear is still there, but I have talked myself down a bit by now. I can always not answer the door if needs be.



T+01:00 This isn't so bad. Taking the substance on top of food slows the onset, and it's a low dose. Things have gone slightly wavy, very mild OEVs and some body sensation, also wavelike. I decide to update Fedora (a linux distribution, on my computer). Things break, I fix them (I could go into detail, but I'll spare the reader). I note that my concentration, and focus isn't as great as normal, but I do ok doing complex computer type tasks, searching for solutions on multiple websites, etc.



T+04:00 My how time flies! Some of that spent fixing the computer, some more wowing strange 3d effects on the computer. Well enough of that. I think about putting some music on, but just end up listening to the normal sounds of the day. It dawns on me that there is a lot of sensory enhancement. A loud noise causes a funny drawing out sensation in my body, sort of like being sucked towards it. Ok it's fairly tame compared to my previous experience, of feeling as if I am flowing to music, but interesting that it is present with a low dose.



T+05:00 I'm wrapping presents, and I drop a box of chocolates. They spill out, so now I can't give them as a present. I pick one up and eat it. WOW Taste explosion! Just like chocolate but so much more so. It's lunch time, so I go explore food. I settle on something simple, a slice of toast, with pate. The smell of the toast! The taste is something else, so much more than normal, it's the same taste, but magnified, intensified, and drawn out. I grind some coffee, and make it fresh. That too is so intense, I get lost in it for a while. It's not that anything tastes different, but I can almost pick over the flavours, examine them and such things. All fear is gone now, I'm enjoying this a great deal. The waviness has gone, the sensory enhancement is still in full force. 



T+5:30 Time to re-dose, on a full stomach again, so hopefully no surprises. Again 10mg taken in water. I eat an apple, this does quite well at getting rid of the taste. As a plus I get an intense appley experience.



T+06:00 Not a first alert exactly, but things have gone up a notch. Very mild, and steady, I didn't get to baseline, and have not shot back up either. Just a slight increase in intensity, and the waviness is back.



T+0:700 I amused myself for a bit. I can't say what I did, just sort of rambled away in my own head. I though of friends, and passed away some time. Nothing particularly deep, but it was quite meaningful in some ways, just not overly intense. 



T+07:20 My visitor is here! Shouldn't take long to swap an electricity meter\ldots\ldots. BUT General chaos ensues, things are ripped off the wall, I have to go and get a drill, screws, and fix the board that the meter goes on back to the wall. Nothing is ever simple! The job gets done in the end, though it takes longer than anyone could imagine. Mr meter isn't very chatty, but there is a conversation. Once the job is done, he is out of my way. I'm glad it's over, thankfully I didn't imagine this sort of performance earlier, or I may have been less happy. 



T+08:00  Just chilling out, put some music on, and made another cup of coffee. The coffee was everything expected and more. The music was also similarly enhanced. I just dreamed, and listened, and dreamed some more. Who would have thought such simple, normal things would be so deep? All you have to do is look. I realise that sometimes, when everything is just right, this sort of thing happens without chemicals. Those times are few, and far between, but it does happen. Now though, it's just so\ldots.. Easy? Simple? Right? 



T+09:30 Time to prepare food again. A simple stir fry, chicken, fresh vegetables, and some rice. After the last food experience, I'm looking forward to this! There is quite a bit of prep, chopping of vegetables. The colour, and smells are all great, everything is enhanced. I decide to go easy on the herbs and spices. Let the natural flavour have it's say. The whole cooking experience was great, the colour, smell and taste.



T+10:30 Food is so good! I thank the god, goddess, earth, and in fact anyone/thing involved, for allowing me to experience this. I hope I can capture some of the same feelings / joy in simple things in my everyday life. I realise I do see these things in everyday life, but this has opened my eyes to it in subtle ways, things that are hard to explain. I burn some incense, by way of an offering, the smell is of course divine, then multiplied by 10. I'm not particularly messed up, or tripping that strongly, but I'm having a serious experience here. It's all normal stuff, but magnified many times over. 



T+10:45 Wow! Some deep stuff there. There is no way to put it into words, but, just WOW! Time for more chemicals, another 10mg.



T+11:30 I read some trip reports, and try to digest my thoughts, and the food. It's easy to do both. I am happy, very happy. Not the fake chemical happy you get from drugs as such. Just enhanced natural happiness, that may sound silly, but there is a whole world of difference. I'm happy that the earth (universe, god, goddess, everything) cares for me, and that I try to return that care, you can't get any bigger love than that, it's just not possible. 



T+12:00 This has been, and still is very different, and more rewarding, than a higher dose. I am having a hard time deciding what to rate any of this on the trip scale. It's both a variable intensity ++, and ++++. This is slightly confusing, because it should be one or the other, but is obviously both. 



T+14:00 I have spent a good time writing this up, and going over it. The WOW factor is still there. It's a very different wow than a high dose, in many ways better, or at least it seems much more satisfying. Everything is so much more than I can capture in words alone, but I have tried (and failed miserably). I can only hope that some of the wonders I have seen make it through. 



T+15:00 Enough of the writing, contemplation, meditation, and sleep await.  



I can only hope that others who try this compound are able to explore this side. It would be such a shame to pass this over in the pursuit of blasting your self to the four corners. More isn't always better! 



I have gained from the experience greatly, more so than just having fun, although it was fun. It goes much further than that, to the very core of who, and what I am. My place in the world, and beyond even that. I would say that this has been a great tool, making this possible, but not getting in the way.

FOLLOW-UP EROWID EDITOR'S NOTE:



Case of mistaken identity; subsequent to the original submission of this report, the author wrote in `The substance is incorrect, and is actually 4-aco-mipt, this was recently discovered, due to sending a sample to be tested.  This is either an error on the part of the vendor, or myself, it is impossible to say.'



No other information is provided, such as information about via what analysis method the substance was positively identified.
