Title: You can't untake a drug

Materials experience in order beginning at age 14.  Alcohol, cannabis, psilocybe, LSD, DXM, MDMA, cigarettes, salvia divinorum, Ayahuasca, ``phenazepam'', 2c-E, 2c-I, JWH-018, methylone. 

Gender: male



Substance: Alcohol -- beer/hard alcohol

	   2c-I - 80mg



On this particular day I had no intent to take any substances other than maybe alcohol.  I would consider myself to have been an alcoholic at this point in my life, episodes occurring mainly every 1-2 weeks.  I had spent the day clearing branches in the yard and building a fire in a fire ring.  I ate supper with my family, and then went outside to light the fire.  It was a pretty chilly night, and the fire and the alcohol synergized just perfectly.  I started drinking around 8pm and by ?12 or 1am had consumed 5 twelve oz. bottles of ale and the very most of a 375ml bottle of gin.  



At this point I realized that I was heavily intoxicated.  Way too drunk to go inside and go to sleep.  I did have the remains of what was presumed to be 100mg of 2c-I.  I had had 1 previous attempt with this material.  I had eyeballed, and shot for around 20mg.  I wouldn't say that I liked it the first time, but I thought I might not have taken enough, better to err on the low side.  The feeling was very tactile, and it affected my sense of taste in a neutral/negative way.  I had no visuals and my vision seemed brightened in a neutral/negative way.  Definitely some audio hallucinations.



I went to my room and grabbed out the plastic bag 2c-I.  This material really sticks to plastic.  It looked nearly impossible for me, in my condition, to eyeball a dose the way it was sticking to its self and the bag.  In one terrible lapse of judgment, I stuck the bag in my mouth and started chewing.  This had a very distinct, very chemical taste, and it took about 15 min. of chewing and swallowing a very potent medicine.  I was filled with anticipation as I walked back out to the fire.  



All I had to do now was wait.  It's rumored that substance takes up to two hours to reach full effect and I knew that this would hit a lot faster based on the amount.  The first time seemed to take maybe 30-45 minutes.  This I could feel the first effects in 15 minutes.  



What happened was, it was cold outside, the fire was going out, and I was quickly losing control over my motor functions.  I was still interested in seeing what would happen.  It had to find some way of keeping warm so I sat inside my vehicle and messed around with a cell phone.  It seems like I sat there for awhile and passed out/dissolved for about 45 minutes to 2 hours.  I was awakened.  It was simply too cold out, and I had to go inside.  



I really just wanted it to be a normal night for everyone else.  I lay in bed like I would normally do except I am tripping balls and still very drunk.  It is definitely a lesson to be learned that alcohol and psychedelics, of any nature, do not mix.  My dog knows something is up.  She hates it when I am drunk, not because I am mean, but because I make a fool out of myself and someone or something might get hurt or broken.  I am no longer having fun.  I would rather just pass out but that was an impossibility.  



The most intense effects seemed to build for 3-5 hrs., but it was probably more like 3-4 the way it just kept building and building.  I knew that I had made a mistake, and this would be an ordeal.  In this extremely agitated state, I go to the bathroom to make myself puke as much as I can, realizing this too late anyway.  All I can say is there is no way to get comfortable.  If I am laying down, I feel like I should be sitting up.  If the lights are off, I feel like they should be on.  Over and over.  



I don't like pulling all-nighters. Everything looks so amazingly crystal clear, but there is a huge weight and empty headedness.  The weight feels like a massive heavenly body named Iodine.  The feeling is that I am trapped in the inescapable grasp of a female intelligence.  It is indescribable but I am in her firm grasp and my entire body is rearranging itself according to her whim.  I can see and feel this, and it feels exactly how I would imagine mercury poisoning feels like.  She is very vain and she makes me smile a lot for no reason except to make me feel vain and to go through my thoughts.  



Tactile hallucinations are intense and feels very ``sticky'' like plastic.  The very idea of plastic is bad in this state.  I am scared to touch anything plastic because it is static and nasty.  Visuals are slightly boiling textures on a small scale.  It's like pixels about the size of a raindrop that just keep moving around.  Time is slowed way down and I am fully aware of every second.  I am not proud of myself for getting myself into this.  I ate some benedryl.



By morning I was a walking disaster.  I had spent all night in dread and when the sun came up I was imagining things like crazy.  I couldn't tell what my body was doing except full sensory overload.  You can not hide this state from anybody.  All I could do about it is keep walking and walking and walking.  Alright, here the visuals flare out.  



There was a new found looseness to the rest of the trip.  Everything was fine and beautiful, but I had literally no connection to my body.  I couldn't tell if I was OK and I was scared shitless.  Maybe a fatal error had occurred.  I really couldn't tell.  I kept trying to just walk it off, but then I may have made a very big mistake. I was asking to go to the hospital.



We went to the hospital because I was having a severe anxiety attack.  I was very concerned that something was not right, however the emergency room equipment was showing that I was pretty normal.  I asked for some benzos and was refused until a urine sample could be taken.  If I had had any benzo beforehand I would have taken it and probably been fine.  Anyway, I was so overloaded that giving a urine sample was a complete impossibility and I could hear everything going on outside the bathroom.  



They were giving me IV fluids to make me pee and I still couldn't so guess what.  I got to be held down and get my first catheter.  It was pure dread and felt all most, well, horrible.  After that happened I just laid there writhing in agony.  I think it was very dehumanizing and I withdrew into my own little world.  If I had had any brains left, since I was obviously not in any real critical danger according to the machines, I should have left the emergency room.  I did not protest being held overnight.  It felt like operating my body was confusing.  I finally got a benzodiazepine, Ativan, and I was fine to lay in the hospital bed.  I wasn't released until the next afternoon after waiting to be checked out by a psychiatrist, family doctor, and a counselor.  



In hindsight it was an incredibly regrettable intense experience.  The Med bills are expensive and I didn't even see it coming.  To top it all off, because I was lucky, I was in no real medical danger.  There is no need to push this material this high.  And remember that you can't untake a drug.  This experience really took it out of me and I was not back to baseline for 5-6 days.  It wasn't just regular depression either.  I would wake up in the middle of the night and just feel terrible every night for 3-4 nights.
