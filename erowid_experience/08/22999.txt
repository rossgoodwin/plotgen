I just tried HBW for the first time and had a positive experience, so I hope the things I learned can be of value to others. I'm in my mid-twenties, with pretty broad experience in most drugs, though my tastes run almost exclusively to MJ and booze, with occasional (i.e. once or twice a year) psychedelic voyages facilitated by entheogens like psilocybin mushrooms or LSD. Wanting to try something new, I researched HBW and decided to give it a try, buying seeds online. 



First I chose a good time to dose- it was a beautiful Sunday morning in the spring, I had no pressing responsibilities to attend to and I had the whole day to myself. Furthermore, I was in good mental/physical/spiritual health and ready for a new experience, so I prepared a drink from nine HBW seeds. Here's what I did:



1. Scrape the seeds with knife, removing as much of the brown, woolly matter as possible, so the seed looks white. This fuzz is the stuff that will irritate your stomach.



2. Fill a jar with warm water, soak seeds for two hours



3. Remove seeds, try to scrape away any lingering brown fuzz (it's easier after they've been soaking), then crush seeds to a pulp with mortar and pestle. Needlenose pliers or a hammer will work, too. 



4. Take pulp, put in jar with water, shake vigorously a few times. The water will turn brown-green. Drink the whole thing and relax. 



DOSAGE NOTE: I'm a lean 6'3 and 190 lbs., I work out regularly, have a quick metabolism and a sensitive stomach. I took the nine seeds on an empty stomach and found it was a good dose for me, especially for my first time. 



The mixture didn't taste that bad, but it didn't taste that great, either. So I sat back, put on some tunes and took a couple bong rips, for both pleasure and to help with the nausea. After about 30-45 minutes my stomach rumbled. I felt nauseated enough to think that at any minute I'd be running for the bathroom to hurl my guts out, but I closed my eyes, relaxed and pulled it together. After a few minutes, the nausea got better, so I drank some water took a soothing bong rip and my stomach returned to calm.  The nausea passes and never comes back. The effects came slowly. After an hour or two, I noticed a definite change, though nothing major: a mellow, full-body tingle and altered perceptions, especially where time and space were concerned. I tried watching a basketball game on TV but found it too hard to follow, even though I'm a fan of the game. Relaxing, listening to music and sitting outside on the porch by the trees was the best thing to do. 



At three hours the effects plateaued and I thought that was it, the experiment failed. I'm glad I was wrong. Suddenly at the fourth hour, the stuff really kicked in: I had a wonderful mind trip very similar to a mild dose of good LSD, but with a surprising burst of energy I hadn't experienced with any other psychedelics. I felt calm, serene and full of vigor all at once, stoned and full of piss and vinegar.  After a while, I walked in the park  through the grass and trees, enjoying the beautiful spring day. The effects tapered off after a couple more hours, so the total trip time was about eight hours, though I felt a few lingering effects into the ninth, tenth and even eleventh hours. 



SUMMARY: This was an excellent experience- a mellow, easy buzz, similar to a mild dose of good LSD. It lasted about eight hours, with an onset of about one hour and the peak hitting after 4 hours. There was some initial nausea, but it's not that bad and it passes. Cannabis goes very well with HBW, it kicks off the trip and calms the stomach.
