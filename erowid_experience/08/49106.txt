Before I begin talking about my experience, I would like to give a little bit of information concerning myself and drugs.

  

I'm not really one to regularly use drugs for recreational purposes, mainly because I try to avoid addiction as much as possible and highs are more intense and enjoyable for me after being sober for so long.  Kind of like a special gift I give to myself every couple of weeks or so.  I'm not the biggest fan of opiates or downers.  I don't really like to get `fucked up'.  As I a dedicated student and family member and being a senior in high school I am required to be very attentive and alert.  So my drugs of choice when I do use them are usually anything with effects relating to amphetamines, mainly meth.  Also, I do not like to mix drugs.  I have discovered though that Oxycodone is a drug that I thoroughly enjoy, and is definitely my main choice when it comes to opiates.  Anyways, I shall move on to my Oxycodone experience.



Being a very ordered person I tend to make every preparation and arrangement possible in order to obtain the level of highness that I want and to make the high as comfortable and fun as possible.  I have done Oxycodone many times in the past so before I began I made sure I had a CD with my favorite soft/melodic rock music, a glass of water, utensils I could use for drawing or writing, and my laptop.  Also I went ahead and smoked a cigarette because usually once I have codeine in my system I tend to have strong urges for cigarettes but at the same time if I smoke it will make me slightly nauseous.  Today is Christmas so I made sure that earlier in the day I did not drink or take anything that would effect this high, like I said I hate to mix things.



After making my preparations, I crushed up a 20 mg tablet of Oxycodone (small round pink pill) and divided it up into 4 equal lines.  I like snorting Oxycodone because of the much faster onset, nonetheless it gives me control over how much I take at any given time.  I turned on my music and snorted my first line at around 8:45 PM.  At around 8:51 I felt a very slight mellowness and I went ahead and smoked about a quarter of a cigarette at that time.  



At 9:00 I went ahead and snorted my second line.  Instead of snorting it all at once I like to space it out and sort of build up my high.  By 9:07 a tiny bit of heaviness began to accompany the mellowness/relaxation I was feeling.  Also, I began to itch a little bit, which is normal when using oxycodone.  It doesn't really bother me though. I smoked another quarter of my cigarette at 9:17 (I smoke little by little after every line as to avoid nausea and fulfill my cravings at the same time).  By this time I noticed that I was getting distracted every now and then. Aside from that, there were no other effects.



At 9:22 I snorted my third line.  By 9:28 the heaviness became more prominent.  Well it's not exactly a heaviness, it's like everything is softened, mainly my movements and perception of music and my body.  It's slowed down a bit but not weighed down.  Also I felt a sense of euphoria, nothing extreme, just a good amount of contentment.  Also I am starting to get distracted more easily.  I like to occupy myself when I am doing Oxycodone, but I tend to get lost in my preoccupation, especially when I am drawing or talking on the phone.  Because of this, I begin to lose sense of time, it seems to go a little faster than usual.



At 9:32 I went ahead and took a few more puffs off my cigarettes and then sat back and listened to music.  I started to itch a little more.  The itching was really bad the first time I tried Oxy, but after a few usages the itching wasn't so intense.



At 9:40 I snorted my fourth line. By 9:46 I started to itch a lot more, but it's made tolerable by the Oxy.  Everything gets `softer' and it's hard to really concentrate on anything for a long period of time.  My vision isn't exactly `sketchy' or `obscured', I don't feel like I'm spinning or anything, but when I try to read something or concentrate my vision on one thing, particularly something small, my eyes will begin to drift from my focal point after a couple of minutes.  Also the itchiness compels me to rub my face a lot, but it's odd because it's almost like my face doesn't even itch, it just feels good to rub it.  At some points in time I hardly even feel the high, I just feel that slight euphoria and relaxation (and the itching), but once I try to do something that requires movement or concentration I can actually gauge how intense my high is.  I am going to smoke a full cigarette this time, which will make me sick, but I can alleviate the nausea by laying down and going to sleep.



In summary, Oxycodone is a great drug to use for relaxation purposes.  The dose I used was not a large dose nor was it all that small.  I used just enough to feel the euphoria, pillowy relaxation, and even a slight disorientation.  I have used up to 50 milligrams before, which wasn't too bad of an experience but I got sick a lot easier, the disorientation was a little bit annoying, I would be only be half-conscious at times, and I got a little bit freaked out because I could feel my heart pounding but I couldn't discern it's pace or rhythm (at times it felt like it was racing wildly).  Also, in this certain case I spaced out the time in between snorting my 4 lines a lot.  I actually prefer to have snorted all of my 20 mg within at least 20-30 minutes and then go to bed.



The day after isn't really too bad, it's just hard to wake up and I sleep a little longer than usual.  I have also noticed that Oxycodone can tend to work in the same way as Hydrocodone, at first producing euphoria and somewhat of a restlessness, and then making me grow a little groggy.  Except I find Oxycodone to have a better euphoric effect.
