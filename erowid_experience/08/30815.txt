I am a 17 year old white male in good health mentally and physically, with a with a wide range of drug experience (especially tryptamines). I live in a small, rural town of about 9000 people in SouthWest Colorado (should be easy enough to guess). My first experiment with 5-Methoxy-Alphamethyltryptamine was roughly 3 weeks ago. I ordered .5 gram from an online chemical supply company for \$85.00 plus a few bucks shipping. When I recieved the order I purchased 1 pint of 190 proof (95\% Ethanol) Everclear from a local liquor store and dissolved the 500 mgs in 250 mls of the ethanol. 



I was sound emotionally and physically at the time of my first dose, no big problems in my social life either. I decided to start low and ingested 2mls (containing 4 mgs of the tryptamine) of the liquid mixed in 48mls of distilled water (8:30am). My empty stomach immediatly started churning when the alcohol hit, after fasting 10 hours for absorbance efficiency. The first 45 minutes consisted of nothing but slight nauseau. At the 45 minute point I began to feel the familiar tryptamine buzz come on, which, to me, consists of feeling of an internal `energy' or a buzzing feeling. This continued, getting progressively stronger, until the 1 hour 45 minute mark, when I began to see tracers and slight wavy movements near the outside of my vision. These same effects continued to increase until about the 4 hour point, when my experience peaked. The effects were entirely visual and physical, lacking any mental change at all. The visuals were fairly unspectacular, consisting of powerful tracers, bright colors, and the melting and moving of objects within my vision. There were no closed eye visuals of any kind. 



I dosed at 8:30 am and went to bed at 11pm still going pretty strong. By the end of the night I had a mild headache from tripping so long, as it was quite a strain on my brain. The 5-Meo-AMT did not affect my behavior or thinking at all while tripping. I went through the entire day acting normally, no one had an idea I was tripping. My pupils were not dilated at all, in fact the were smaller than usual. It was slightly hard to get to sleep, but once I fell asleep, I slept well.



My first experience with this substance was fairly unspectacular. Even though the visuals got pretty heavy at times, it was nothing I hadn't experienced with other tryptamines. In fact, I would describe this as the most basic tryptamine I have ever experienced. It just has the basic visuals that I experience with many tryptamines. The only thing that set 5-Meo-AMT apart, in my mind, was the length of the trip. 



My second 5-MeO-AMT experience was a whole lot better. Last Friday, I got out of school at about 12:30 and decided to trip. I had to get up at ungodly hour on Saturday morning for a school trip (no, not that kind of trip) so I didnt want to drink. I decided to go for a higher dose of 5-MeO-AMT mixed with another tryptamine, because my first 5-Meo-AMT was not much of an `experience,' just a temporary visual `toy.'                  



I checked through my stash to find a mate for the 5MA. I passed over the 5-MeO-DMT, DMT, AMT, 4-AcO-DET, salvia, `shroomies, DXM, a few 2Cs, and a few 'common' recreationals drugs, and finally decided on Dipropyltryptamine (as the HCl salt). I mixed 4ml of the everclear in with a glass of orange juice and ingested it at 1pm. I decided to wait for the full effects of the 5MA to come on before dosing any DPT. I had eaten a turkey sandwich at lunch about 90 minutes prior to dosing. I think this, along with the Everclear being dissolved in OJ, prevented the nauseau that I had felt with my first experience.  



I peaked around 2 hours 30 minutes after taking the original dose. The effects were similar to, but much stronger than, the effects of the first trip. These consisted of 8 or 9 image long tracers at times, combined with near blinding lights and extreme image melting and moving. reading was impossible, as the words would all become one and split apart again constantly. The smaller the image, the more radically it moved. It felt like everything in my vision was moving, along with my body. This continued, without slowing down for 3 or 4 hours after the peak (5:30 to 6:30 after dosing).                                   



At T+5 hours, I decided to bust out the DPT and my pipe. Me visuals were still going strong from the 5MA, so I started off with a low DPT dose. I hadn't had time to freebase the DPT, but in my trials, the DPT HCl salt smoked nearly as well as the freebase, so I didnt expect significantly decreased efficiency. I started off with my personal low dose for DPT HCl, 30mg. I loaded it on top of a tiny bit of crushed Artemesia tridentata leaf (a local sage brush that serves well as a smokable base for drugs). I held the pipe to my mouth and slowly inhaled. The powder vaporized very quickly. I inhaled for about 8 seconds, then held the hit in for as long as I could. By the time I exhaled, there was no smoke left in my lungs and I was already feeling the effects. The smoke wasnt harsh, but slightly bad tasting. Immediatly, my open eye visuals ecame extremely intense. I was sitting in a car that had frost all over the windows, and I remember instantly seeing faces in every inch of the windows. Everything was moving and spinning around at an incredible rate. There were still not many mental effects. 



After that first hit, I felt safe doing the other 70 mgs I had taken with me. I loaded the rest of the powder into my pipe, and proceeded to take a massive hit. I held it in for roughly 45 seconds, and by that time I was having insane visuals. The hundreds of faces I was seeing all began to move and laugh, all the while my mind began to see things totally differently. Everything was `odd,' in an indescribable way. I instantly related the mental effects to a mid level salvia trip. Able to see and move around fairly well, but everything was just `different.' As the DPT peaked, my vision broke down into three colors: red green and blue. There were three images of my vision, one in each color. I began to think I was looking at a TV whose signal was phasing in and out. After peaking, I began laughing at everything. The 3 friends I was with were also on the DPT and whenever one of us laughed at something, the others would always join in. We laughed for the better part of 4 hours.                            



During one of these hours I stopped at an Arby's to get some food, and while eating I began to get slight synesthesia. I took a bite of a curly fry covered in Arby's sauce and instantly I thought,'That tastes blue!' It took me a few seconds to realize what I had just thought. At first the thought seemd completely normal in my state. For a good hour I kept ordering and eating small amounts of food just to see how my brain would interpret the taste. I got all kinds of weird tastes doing that. It was extremely fun and interesting to experience this kind of isolated synesthesia. I eventually went home at about midnight, and when I got home I realized that the effects of the DPT were lasting incredibly long. after about 5 hours from my second DPT dose, I was still feeling moderate effects unique to DPT. Needless to say, the 5MA was still going strong. The 5MA and DPT definetly potentiated and prolonged the effects of one another. I tried going to sleep at 1am but it took me a hell of a long time to fall asleep, due to the intense CEVs I was getting whenever I closed my eyes. I finally fell asleep around 1:45 or 2am.       

                                                    

I woke up at 420am to get ready for the school `Knowledge Bowl' trip that left at 5. (Ironically, many of the smartest kids in our school were `trip-mates' of mine. Theres no feeling like giving someone who may very well grow up to be an important figure in society their first drug experiences :-) ) When I woke up, I was still tripping pretty hard from the 5-MeO-AMT. I was dead tired, but I couldnt tell if it was because of the drugs or the 2 and a half hours of sleep I got. 5-MeO-AMT has a lot of potential in my eyes, as a simple boredom killer, or as a complement to another drug or drugs. I am eager to try it at the 12-16mg range. Definetly an interesting compound.
