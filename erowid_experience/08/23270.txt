 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\#  





First off I'd like to note that I'd eaten about 10 Adderall pills, slept 4-7 hours, smoked some pot (1-5 times each day) and eaten only 2 small meals in the 3 days before this. Any, all or even none of this could have factored into the effects. The Adderall pills are time-release and meant to last 12-14 hours. The computer duster was PerfectData `PerfectDuster II', containing Chlorodifluoromethane.



I learned about computer duster the night before from a friend of mine. He let me try it at his house. I took a hit and enjoyed it. I decided I would try it again soon. The next day I got my hands on a bottle. I ate 2 Adderall pills sometime between noon and 1. I called my friend and asked him to meet me at 10. We walked down to a gas station to get cigarettes, stopping a couple times to take a hit. We got back to my friends house around 11, waiting for his parents to go to bed.



They went to bed at 11:30, so at 11:45 we put on the Kottonmouth Kings, A band who has at least one song perfect for every drug, and started taking hits. We took a hit every few minutes for half an hour, totalling about 10-12 hits each, every hit getting more and more intense. The first 5 or so hits felt like I'd taken an entire baloon of nitrous. After that, it was almost exactly like I was peaking on multiple, potent, ecstacy pills. The last hit I took gave me visual hallucinations. The world moved in and out quickly, like my eyes were pulsating like my heart. I headed home around 12:30.



I got home and was planning on hitting the duster a few more times then sleeping (it'd been a while since I had), but I noticed that my heart rate was still up. I decided to wait a while until the Adderall wore off. Around 4 I was still pretty speedy, I got tired of waiting and went to my room. I put on my headphones and picked the song `Brain On Drugs' by Shakey Bones, thinking it would be the perfect song to listen to while doing a duster. I was lying in my bed under the covers with the lights off. I took a hit and held it in. I pressed play on my boombox as soon as I started to feel it. As soon as I exhaled, I took another hit. I'd never done 2 hits in a row of it before.



Visual hallucinations set in instantly. I felt like I was rising in the air slowly, the walls turned a dark red. My mind split in two, one thinking how incredible this was, the other saying the words, oddly enough, `drug experience' over and over again in my head. But the words stopped and the trip changed directions. The song I was listening to had a DJ spinning a record. But I couldn't hear the song any more. All I could hear was the record spinning faster and faster, getting more and more high pitched. I rose higher into the air, the walls were getting a brighter red.



I panicked, thinking ( or maybe it was) that my heart was going faster to the music and that at any moment it would explode. I sat up quickly and I ripped my headphones out of the jack, but that didnt help. The record still spun faster, my heart beat more and my mind was preparing to die. I ripped the boombox plug out of the socket and the record stopped. I sat on my bed, taking huge gasps of air. The trip itself was a mere 1-2 minutes long. My heart returned to normal. I came down from the high. It was horrible. I was positive I was about to die.



Despite always taking precautions before drug use, I was incredibly stupid about this. First off, mixing drugs is never truly safe. Second, I was well aware of the hallucinogenic effects of this on one hit, 2 was a whole new world, and I did it alone anyway. Never, EVER trip alone. Third, any drugs you should do with caution when you're worrying/scared/any negative thoughts. (i.e. I was worried a bit about my heart beat, since the Adderall had not yet worn off after I expected it to.) I would suggest both Adderall and computer duster (not a lot though) for recreational purposes, but mixing them was obviously a bad idea. Please, everybody, no matter what you're doing, I beg you, BE CAREFUL. Being certain you're going to die is easily the worst feeling in the world.
