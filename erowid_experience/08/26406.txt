 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\#  

I grew up in a small farming town in America where it seemed that huffing was a rite of passage.  Nearly 75\% of the crowd I hung out with had experimented with inhalants by the age of 13.  The most commonly abused inhalant was gasoline.  Before I started experimenting with alcohol, pot, psychedelics, etc, I was a gas can man.

Gas produces a `drunk rush'.  My body fights it for the first few breaths and then I can feel my lungs open, my blood vessels dilate, and my body lighten.  The feeling is slightly similar to going from 0-10 drinks in a few seconds, excepting for the differences in mood between gas and alcohol.  I found in general my mood to be somber and introspective on gasoline, although this may attributed to my usual setting\ldots in a garage, by myself, with slower music playing.  

My experiences had produced mainly the common audio beeping hallucination (this seemed to be common to a majority of abusers in my hometown), as well as the general `electric blue' patterning that a few of my friends dubbed `kinetics' while in the depths of a binge.

Probably around my 4th or 5th experience with gasoline was particularly memorable.  I was sleeping on a couch in the garage at the time, due to a visit by out of town family for a few weeks.  While bored one night trying to fall asleep, I figured I was going to grab that gas can and huff until something more happened.  I began breathing out of our red metal gas can with a fury and purpose.  The kinetics and beeping were becoming intense, too intense.  

I had probably been going at if for an hour or so.  The beeping was becoming higher in pitch, and the beeps faster as well.  There was a physical discomfort that was directly correlated with the pitch of the beeping.  I was not to be deterred though, and kept my mouth to that can.  It was sometime not long after the beeping became slightly painful that I stopped paying attention to my visual input (for lack of a better description).  I was so focused on the audio qualities of the experience that I let my mind block all else out.  

Then \ldots BANG\ldots  the sound changed into a atari-esque crash and burn sound.  This was an immense relief.  But then things became very strange as I began to seem myself as a glowing orange bird.  The experience gets very trippy and a tad personal from here on in, so the description will end.   Best to describe it all-in-all as mystically terrifying.

When I regained visual input, I was laying in a pool of gasoline on the garage floor.  My skin burned and my breath stank.  And I kept huffing.  I was able to hide my problem the next day with a cover story about fixing the lawnmower while I couldn't sleep.

This should have been enough to end my huffing habits, but it fed them like, well, gas on a fire.

Over the next months my habit spiraled out of control.  By the time I quit I was using various inhalants about 12 times a day, including first thing in the morning, huffing myself to sleep, and keeping scotch guard in the night stand in case I awoke at night.  

Most of the experiences were mundane\ldots just to achieve the rush.  Any time the experience would get out of hand, mainly from a familiar sound, would trigger paranoia.  Sometimes enough to make me literally run screaming.  To cover for my habit, I was constantly lying to my family to cover for the smell.  And at this point, I was still a kid.  This habit made me a pro at lying to my family which is a skill I wish I never would have developed.  This may be the worst part of the experience.

When I finally decided to quit, little did I know this would entail some awful withdrawal pains for about 2 weeks.  Quitting was hard physically but not hard mentally.  After nearly getting caught huffing gas on the job, I knew it was time to stop.  But my first few `relapses' were all due to the withdrawal pains\ldots which could be stopped by huffing.

This stuff has permanently altered my mind and vision.  The `kinetics' never totally went away, and are fully a part of my life, responding to stimulus like an annoying little pet.  The reactions to sounds still persist as well.  It can be pretty embarrassing trying to explain to a new girlfriend why I have to leave running because a bus `sounds scary'.  An in addition, my right eye has some vision damage from a mishap with some Scotch Gaurd.
