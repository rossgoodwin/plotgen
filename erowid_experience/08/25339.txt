It was early December of 2002 -- just a month before, I had discovered the joys of marijuana, and decided I need to expand. I wanted to hallucinate, I thought of the process as mystical and mind-expanding. After 2 weeks of zealous research, I discovered Dramamine. I had had many negative trip reports up to this point, but my stubborn teenage sense of adventure had taken over.



So it was simple: one day after school I went to my local Shop and bought a box of 12 Dramamine tablets, and went home. I read the box, and noted the `Do Not Exceed This Dosage' warning. I will always remember reading this and blowing it off. I was wrong and it cost me.



So I got home around 3 o'clock. At this point I was bubbling with excitement and anxiety: I was going to see the dark side of the moon, a concept introduced to me only weeks earlier. I giddily took out the white pills. This was it, there was no turning back. I filled my mouth with water and took the pills three at a time. There taste was absolutely revolting, it was like a very bland piece of concrete, and I gagged a few times. But in the course of a minute, I took the twelve 50 mg dimenhydrinate pills.



All I expected was some annoying drowsiness, and then fantastic hallucinations like I never imagined.



I sat at my computer typing away to people on message boards about how anxious I was. After around 20 minutes I felt the first effects.  One was the perception of the weight of my body\ldots when I stood up I felt as if I had a 75 pound backpack on. I walked to the bathroom and just sat on the toilet, for lack of anything else to do. As I looked down at the floor, I started to notice I was hallucinating. It was nothing like I had expected. As I stared at the floor, the center of my vision seemed to be fluctuating. Some light black waterish pattern seemed to be compacting and releasing and compacting and releasing again. I stared at this intently. I felt little emotion as I looked at it. It was intriguing to see and all I could do was watch and stay silent. 



After about 5 minutes, I noticed that I was getting incredibly tired. The feeling absolutely revolted me. I felt as if I hadn't slept in 2 or 3 days. I was fatigued beyond any previous experience. Also, my body continued to get heavier. When I tried to walk, it was  noticeably more difficult. I walked into my room and sat on my bed.



I remained on my bed for about 30 minutes, just looking at the visuals. They were fascinating. Along with the black water, a sort of a static field had formed. I went on my computer, but at this point I was totally blown -- walking was extremely tiring, and I felt as if I could fall asleep any minute. I was so disoriented it really made me severely anxious. I felt the worst I had in my life. I kept on getting this urge to stretch my muscles (they felt powerless), especially my lower back and it was extremely uncomfortable. I also had to pee every 5 minutes, but couldn't. AND I was getting a bit bizarre, I started to walk around upstairs looking for somewhere to go but I couldn't. It was frustrating. I felt like I had to find someplace to feel better but that place was nowhere. After about an hour and thirty into my experience, I went downstairs, and sat on the couch to try to distract myself and watch TV.



As I limped downstairs and sat down (which did not relieve me in the least) and turned on the TV, I realized that I was extremely sensitive to sound. I tried to talk and discovered I had severe dry mouth, I could only mumble barely understandable words one at a time. As the TV flickered on, I was jolted down into my seat. It scared the shit out of me. It was so fucking loud and turning it down just seemed to emphasize that wretched sound was coming out. I was scared. My thought process was severely compromised, and all I thought of was regret. When would this HELL end. I thought this would be enjoyable, cheap, and fun?



Now, about 2 hours in, the most memorable moment of my trip began. Feeling like I am going to go mad, I try to get up and go upstairs to do\ldots anything. I didn't care. Then suddenly I saw the single most fantastic hallucination: On top of the TV, in the 2' by 3' space between it and the power box, I saw dozens upon dozens of flies flying up and down. I blinked. Still there!! It was absolutely stunning, as I watched these black dots fly randomly they seemed to really exist. I wasn't even thinking about there validity, but it seemed so real. One might fly onto a wire between the TV and power box and stay there for a moment, and quickly fly away. The wire might physically move. I approached the TV, and after a minute of apprehension, put my arm in the swarming group of flies. 



Most flew as usual, but to my utter amazement many seemed to land on  my arm, maybe hop a few steps, and fly back. And I could feel them too. Not sharply, but I felt the dull sensations and just stood there for 15 minutes in shock. I was nervous about the flies, but I knew they weren't real. I wasn't concerning to thinking of the reality of them. I went upstairs like I had previously planned to, to do who knows what. 



I still had to go to the bathroom every 5 minutes, and at this point I was getting paranoid that someone would suspect me of being on a drug of some type. I checked out my window nearly constantly under fear I would be caught. I was as paranoid as a schizophrenic. 



Finally, 2 hours and thirty minutes into the hell, I decided I would go to sleep. I was fucking tired. The hallucinations mostly were unimpressive when physically I felt so terrible. My muscle stretching continued and was worse than irritating. It was driving me crazy. I tossed and turned. Looking at the walls, I was still having the static and black water compaction effects. I remember when I was shutting down my computer I could swear that the on-screen mouse was actually smoking some clear vapor. Somewhere along the line, I started looking at my arm, and I had some pretty horrifying visuals. 



When staring at it, parts of my arm would slowly turn terribly dirty and crimson red. I couldn't tell if it was real or not. Also, I saw little individual hairs growing out of my skin. They grew quickly and bent every which way like the legs of some dying insect. I tried to ignore it. 



I then started hearing voices. Nothing too specific, but every 30 seconds I would hear my dad yell my name and wake up and feel terribly frightened. Eventually I heard people having conversations. I don't remember anything specific but I remember them having an especially negative affect on me.



So three hours in, I fell asleep, utterly terrified and disappointed. I woke up the next day very depressed and anxious. It wore off within a week and I decided to get on with my life. I promised myself never to screw with Dramamine again. Unfortunately, I broke that promise an additional five times. This was deeply regretted each time. I chose to come back those times because I was lulled by the hallucinations. The visuals just affected me. They made me want to see them for the shear rarity of there appearance on a normal basis.



Well, the last time (early January)I did Dramamine I took 24, felt like shit, and was caught by my parents and basically screwed. About a month later, in a panic attack, I displayed symptoms of Hallucinogen Persisting Perceptual Disorder (HPPD) which have NOT gone away. So its basically like this: in every single second of my consciousness, I have low dose Dramamine-like visuals. But it doesn't stop there. my anxiety has increased, along with pseudo-paranoia, and I always have to think about the one day I started and thank that for the errors in my body now.
