I was planning to head to a small gathering with some friends I didn't know too well, but with whom I had at least been acquainted since the beginning of the school year. It was after a much larger party at Reed College, and everyone was dressed up and ready to start drinking after a fun and raucous night. I wasn't looking to drink due to antibiotics I was on, so I decided to create my own crazy time that night by insufflating some 2C-B that I had just bought. I had done it before, both orally and by insufflation, at 20 mgs, but my dealer assured me that 40 would be okay orally, and I assumed that meant I could also snort it.



I went to my apartment, with the plan to go back to the dorm after I did the drug to meet my friends. The apartment is a two-minute drive from the dorm, so I snorted it, literally ran to my car, and sped to the dorm. During the drive, my face was burning and I continued to sneeze and cough, but there were no effects of the drug so far. When I arrived at the dorm's parking lot, the drug hit me instantly, and I parked as quickly as possible and got out of the car.  \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# 



That was when it started to really affect me. My pupils began to dilate, creating the illusion that everything was moving. I was able to walk to the dorm, meanwhile hearing echoes of voices all around me from the various people that I saw on the walk to the dorm. When I arrived at my destination, the door was locked. I knew I needed to knock, so I did, and I was let in, barely managing to croak out a thank you.



Instantly, my friends asked if I was okay. I managed to stammer out 2C-B, and then the night started. I remember feelings of my face burning and an overwhelming feeling of nausea. As I sat down, I began to puke. And let me tell you, I now know what puke my guts out means, because that is exactly what I did. And puking on hallucinogens is interesting, because, as I so eloquently said ``I am nothing in my stomach and I am being puked out.'' In other words, I took a trip to being my stomach and physically hallucinated being vomited.



After the overwhelming nausea, which lasted about 20-30 minutes, I was taken out to a quieter hallway where I sat calmly with my friend. The whole time, I was seeing my world in blurred motion, and I was unable to focus on any one thing for more than a few seconds. The world was reduced to fractal patterns and all sounds echoed, quite literally like in the Yellow Submarine. Perhaps the most amazing thing of the trip was I had absolutely no idea what reality was. I couldn't pin down my life at all, as in I couldn't identify what I would wake up to in the morning, I couldn't understand what a duty or chore was, I couldn't understand where exactly I was, and I couldn't identify what my goals or desires truly were. 



A lot of my friends were quite drunk, and I couldn't really remember what was appropriate behavior for a drunk individual and what was appropriate behavior in general. Also, all dimensions were morphed, and let me tell you, the word ``morphed'' does not do the drug justice. I couldn't tell the difference between the distance to the nearest tree and the degree of friendship I shared with the person sitting next to me. Another interesting effect was on how I thought I should respond to social situations. I knew what was funny, but I didn't really know what my own sense of humor was and what little humor nuances I wanted to display. 



After about an hour, I started to calm down as I began to grasp reality a little more firmly. Let it be noted, that this whole time I was a little frightened, but nothing to the point that I wanted it to stop. The only reason I wanted it to stop was because I realized I was being an imposition on my friends. But overall, I was having a pretty great time. Rumors were beginning to spread around the dorm about ``the girl on too much drug'' and people began walking in and out of my vision to observe the girl who reportedly puked everywhere. I was able to raise my hand and point out that the notorious girl was I, but I still focused on several key people who were standing there talking to me and continued my ``conversations'' with them. 



It was reported that I was very contained at this point, but I didn't really feel like that at all. The fractal patterns were continuing, as well as the echoing sounds, and I pointed out several times that ``I get the Beatles.'' I also said I understand what the drugs did to them, but I didn't get why they would want to do these drugs more than once. My view of that definitely changed as the night wore on.



About two hours into my trip, I was enjoying myself immensely. The nausea had ceased, and I was starting to just relax into the visuals and sounds. Various people left, but it was important that I at least had one person with me at all times that was focused on me and talking to me. I was able to describe my experiences a little more than I was earlier at this point, but I was still lost in my own mind just amazed at how altered reality was. All dimensions were still ``morphed'' to me, and I found myself thinking about one thing for an extended period of time, then blurting out a conclusion, only to be distracted and lose my train of thought before I could actually announce what I was trying to iterate. 



Three hours into the trip, the drug was definitely still present, but much less intense. I was able to joke around with friends, drink some water, and get a sense of bearing, both physically and temporally. The come down is great, as I didn't really feel a come down at all, rather a gentle and slow down. While I was slightly let down that everything was ``stopping,'' I realized that I wanted to be off the drug to reflect on what I'd been through, so I welcomed this slowing without any of the comedown effects I tend to get on cocaine and amphetamines.



By four hours, I was almost completely sober and able to walk and talk and head to the opening of 4/20, a large party at Reed College. I didn't partake in any marijuana, but I had no desire, as I simply wanted to reflect on the night's experiences. 



Overall, this drug is fantastic. I consider myself a changed woman, as it showed me that reality is not something at all set in stone, and that the world is a complicated place with many dimensions to be analyzed. Compared to my experiences with 20 mg, snorting 40 was life altering, where 20 I could do almost any weekend as a low-key recreational drug.  2C-B at higher doses is a mind bender to say the least, and I won't be doing it again tomorrow, but I would definitely consider it for sometime in the future.
