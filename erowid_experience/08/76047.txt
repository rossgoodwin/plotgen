The reason I wanted to write this was to help inform people like me who use these experiences as reference for what to expect when using certain drugs.



My drug history includes Marijuana, Concerta, Vicodin, Percocet and Cocaine. I use marijuana 2-3 times a week now, which is less than often than I used to use. I use opiates every day because I am dependent on them, although recently I have curtailed my usage. Also as of recently, I started using cocaine occasionally. However, at the time of this experience the only illicit drug I had used previously was marijuana.

It was a Friday in October , and ever since I started smoking pot, Friday meant one thing, and that was getting stoned and going to the football games and then finding something to do after. On this particular Friday, I just went home after school and didn't think it was going to be all that special. I had plans to do a burn run at about 6:30 with my two friends and then head to the football game which started at 7:00.



Just a little more background, I had wanted to obtain adderall for awhile because I heard if it is snorted it produces effects similar to cocaine, and former friend said he got some. I went to get the pill immediately and looked it up online to make sure it was adderall, however, to my disappointment, it was just a 30mg concerta, or time released Ritalin(I wish I would've payed attention to ``time-released'' but that'll come later). You'd have to do a process on it and basically take the pill apart to snort it, so I threw the pill in the place I keep my weed and forgot about it.



So, back to the day of the experience a few weeks after I had obtained the Concerta, I went home from school and my friend was supposed to get me at 6:00, however he is always late so he called and said it wouldn't be until 6:45 that he'd pick me up. So, me being impatient, I remembered the concerta and popped it at around 6:15 so hopefully I'd be feeling it by the time my 2 friends, we'll call them A and B, picked me up. Well, they picked me up at 6:40 and I still wasn't feeling anything, and then we proceeded on our burn run which lasted about 20 minutes in which B and I smoked about 3 grams between us(roughly 1.5 grams each) and A toked up a little. B and I were thirsty after our burn run so they sent me into the gas station to get some soda. I hadn't stood up in about half an hour so I got up feeling the usual effects of marijuana but I was a little more unbalanced than usual, however I proceeded to go into the gas station and get the drinks, the entire time I was feeling happy and it just felt like a really good marijuana high. It's now about 7:15 and we proceed to the football game, with B and I stoned pretty nice. We arrived at the football game at 7:25 and I was feeling happy, my coordination was relatively unchanged, we parked, I got out of the car, and then it started\ldots 

 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#  



After I got out of the car, I looked around outside and everything felt off a little. We started walking up the hill to get to the game and my eyes started moving in every direction and I remember just repeating to A \& B, ``Oh my God guys I am tweaking right now, I am so whacked out this is crazy, this is insane'' or something along those lines. My heart was beating really fast, my eyes wouldn't stop moving, and walking was a pain because I just wanted to stand still and slow down but even if I would stand still I still felt like things were moving at a million miles per second. We get to the top of the hill around 7:30 and around this point physically my head feels as it always does when I smoke pot, which is light, but my heart is beating, my eyes won't stay in the same direction, and I'm kind of shaking. Mentally I felt scared and worried, I was tweaking, I never felt like this before and I was actually scared, the happiness I had felt earlier was no longer the prevalent feeling.



So, at 7:30 we had got to the top of the hill and we go into the game. At the game I lost A \& B for a little and found this other kid, we'll call him C, and I started talking to him about what I was feeling. I was talking kind of soft but really fast. Then after moving around for about 15 minutes, 2 other people, I don't recall who, joined C and I. As we stood there, I couldn't stand still, I was swaying back and forth, my eyes were half open, my heart was beating fast, my eyes wouldn't stay in the same direction for more than 3 seconds, I couldn't remember anything that happened 15 seconds before, also I felt this strong feeling in the pit of my stomach, it just felt like a big ball of happy energy that wanted to burst, it was really cool. In the next 20 minutes I began to become more comfortable with the state I was in physically and mentally, I was tripping pretty nice, everything was moving fast, I was worried but happy at the same time, and even though I say things were moving fast it felt like the night was taking forever. Around 8:30 I met back up with A and B, I was rather adjusted to the state I was in, I was still tripping but enjoying it, I had no short term memory, couldn't look straight, felt the energy in my belly, was breathing fast, and was having a good time.



At around 9:40 we left the football game, and I was still pretty much in the same state as before, and then we got in A's car, and I told him there's no way I can go home feeling this messed up, so A drove B and I to Starbucks. During the car ride, I tried real hard to focus on coming down, I tried closing my eyes and just tried focusing them and it seemed to work because they weren't moving around as much. About halfway through the car ride, at 9:50, I began mentally coming down, things from my perception weren't as fast anymore and I felt  tired and became more aware of my physical state and how my breathing was fast, how my heart was pounding, and how my eyes weren't really staying straight. We arrived at the relaxed atmosphere of Starbucks and I sunk into a nice comfy chair and tried to relax. Over the next 45 minutes, I mentally pretty much returned to normal, I felt a little happier than usual and I was also proud and happy of myself for the experience I had just gone through. I just sat and talked to my friends. At 10:45 we left Starbucks and I was still working my way off the high, my eyes were still having trouble focusing, the energy in my stomach was pretty much gone, and my heart was still beating rapidly. 



At 10:55 I arrived home, and before I went up to bed for the night I had to check in with my dad which I was worried about doing because I wasn't fully down off my high yet, I was still talking a little faster than usual. So I went to see my dad and tried looking at him while talking to him\ldots Well that's when I realized my eyes still couldn't really focus in like that yet so I pretty much looked at the floor and my eyes were going every which way, luckily he didn't notice and I made it upstairs fine.

I got to bed around 12:00 surprisingly, still with a rapid heartbeat, eyes still unable to really focus, breathing somewhat fast, it was at this time I wish I'd kept in mind that it was time released because I didn't think I'd get to sleep, but unbelievably I did. However it doesn't end here\ldots.



At around 4 in the morning, I woke up after only 4 hours of sleep, I was sweating and my heart was pounding, it felt like it was going to break out of my chest, and I felt like my chest was going to explode. For the next 2 and a half hours I laid in bed afraid I was going to have a heart attack, mentally I was completely normal and that was the worst part because I was able to understand the seriousness of the situation. I tried taking my pulse and it was about 18 beats in 10 seconds, which is a heart rate of 180, which is not a good heart rate you should have while sleeping(normal heart rate while at rest for someone my age is 70-100). All I wanted to do was go back to sleep, and at around 6:30 I did. When I woke up again at 9 I felt very tired and drained.



At first I said I'd never do it again, but to be honest I would. It was a lot of fun actually, I really enjoyed it even though I haven't done it since. The only bad part is when I woke up in the middle of the night scared that I was going to die because my heart was beating so fast. Also, I somewhat regret doing it in public and not a more controlled environment, because I think it helped lead to my initial panic. I do think that combining marijuana and concerta led to this experience, and I wonder what would've happened if I had just done concerta and not the marijuana. However, I assume not much considering the intense experience began half an hour after I had smoked the marijuana, and not in the 45 minutes after I took the concerta.



I hope this is helpful to anyone who is considering using concerta or any drug like it. It was a great experience but just make sure you know what you're doing, do your research and be careful because it's not something you want to mess around with.
