I ordered 50 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds for 15 bucks online.  They were the Hawaiian strain, which I figured would probably be more potent since it was where they were more expensive.  I received them pretty quickly (3 days, priority mail), and waited until I was done with finals to try them.  I decided to try them yesterday.  In preparation to reduce nausea, I only ate a small meal at 12:00pm.



At 7:30 PM last night, I took 9 seeds out of my bag.  They already had the fuzzy coating removed, and I cut each in half with a knife.  I took two dramamines before I ingested them to counter the expected nausea.  I placed 10 halves (5 seeds) in a teacup filled with water, as suggested on the web, and microwaved them for 40 seconds.  I got them out of the water, and ate them.  They were pretty chewy because of the microwave, and went down fairly easy.  The taste was bland\ldots I think next time I'll put some honey in my mouth or just wash em down with pop.  I drank some of the water but I figured it was stupid.  I put 8 more halves (4 seeds) and microwaved them in water for another 40 seconds.  I ate these, drank a bit of Mountain Dew, took one more Dramamine, and sat down to chill.  When all this was said and done it was 7:45 PM.



Within 15 minutes I started to feel a bit heavy.  I was bored so I went and took a shower.  I watched TV until about 9:30.  I was pissed because nothing had happened at all yet other than the heaviness.  I didn't feel any nausea either, which is a telltale sign something's gonna happen.  My friends were over and we decided to go get something to eat.  I had decided that the seeds weren't working, and I was pretty mad since they cost me \$15, and I'm a poor college student.  We went to a restaurant.  I was kinda high on the seeds, in a good mood and heavy feeling, but nothing close to tripping\ldots maybe like I'd smoked a bowl or two.



We ordered a delicious appetizer, and I ate it right up.  I went into the bathroom, I looked fine.  Upon receiving our entrees, I decided I wasn't hungry at all.  I felt a little nausea, went to the bathroom, and tried to force myself to puke.  It didn't work, and I went and looked in the mirror, and my pupils were very dilated.  I decided I didn't want to stay, since I had just gotten off an MJ possession probation.  I know HBWR is legal and all, but I don't think I'd wanna explain to cops why my pupils were the size of dimes.  So we left the restaurant.  That's when it absolutely slapped me at about 9:45, 2 hours after ingesting them.  When my friend started driving, I felt like we were going 90mph, then 10.  Every turn felt way too wide.  When my friend pulled up to the curb, I thought he was gonna go right over it and smash into my front door.



I went inside, no nausea yet.  I started watching TV and talking online, listening to a little music (which, obviously, was awesome on this substance).  My friend was flipping through channels, and there was an asian baseball player on tv.  It said like `Comparing Ichiro,' obviously meaning they were comparing him to someone else.  I was like, `Comparing Ichirio?  What kind of name is Compa-ring???'



Nausea (very bearable) finally hit me for about 10 minutes, and I threw up my delicious appetizer and mashed potatoes.  After that, the nausea was totally gone gone, and I think I plateaued.  I had been playing Warcraft III all day, and I kept seeing characters for that (closed eye).  I went in my bathroom with the lights off, and I tried to make myself see scary shit.  I did, and just laughed at it.  It was easy to distinguish reality from fantasy, and I could see anything I wanted to (closed eye).  I had a cigarette outside.  I couldn't feel the smoke or taste it, and I felt like I was taking huge hits when I was taking really small ones.



We started watching Peewee's Playhouse on Cartoon Network.  The show was very funny on this substance.  Everything was funny and I was babbling to my friend about goofy shit.  I kept twitching my arm though for some reason, and I didn't stop moving my legs all night.  It was apparent I was on something, so I stayed at my apartment until later.  Everything had a rhythm to it, and all the lights were bright, glowing, and warm.  My lamp has a funny pattern on it, and touching it was really neat.  I ate a pack of Gushers.  The sugar tingled my tongue, and the chewy texture plus gooey liquid was amazing in my mouth.  Try different textured foods and objects on this, it's fun.



I was in my room on the computer.  I got really tired, and wanted to go to bed.  However my friend was over and I figured it'd be rude to sleep.  I put my head on my monitor.  It felt really warm\ldots the glass right now is cool to the touch.  I could've fallen asleep on it.  I went downstairs and took some Guarana (in the form of an energy pill also containing Ginseng and a few other `energy' herbals).  I was wide awake within 15 minutes, so I doubt it was from the pills.  Keep in mind that every minute feels like 10 on this stuff.  I tripped for about 2 hours total, but it felt like 5.



We watched some more TV, and I was having a blast.  I started to come down a bit at Midnight, so we went to the strip club.  I think it would've been much more fun when I was peaking, but I was still pretty high.  The cigarettes tasted gross - I smoke Dunhills which taste more natural than most cigs (no additives).  They reminded me of the taste of the seeds, which made me feel kinda weird. So I put it out and just chilled.  Some friends of mine were there, and they had rented a big velvet couch.  So I undid my top two buttons on my shirt, and layed back, imitating Tony Montana in a coked out daze.  



For the first two hours at the strip club I was pretty high.  I couldn't feel parts of my body.  I could've pissed my pants and not known.  That area was numb, but then it got really sensitive later.  I imagine sex on these would be fun (on a lower dose).  I couldn't feel the Coca Cola I was drinking, but I could feel it at the same time.  I found this to be true often with this.  You could do something yet not do it at the same time.  Don't ask me how to explain it.  I finally came down off my high at 2 AM, and all the effects subsided around 2:30.



I ate some pizza rolls, and got a very great sleep.  I woke up at 2 PM, and I feel like a million bucks right now.  My next planned dose is 13 seeds.
