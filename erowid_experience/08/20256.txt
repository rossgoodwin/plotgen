It was a Friday night and all of my friends and I were ready to go to the club.  At about 8 PM a friend of mine asked me if I wanted to do some cocaine.  I laughed because I thought he was joking, but I soon stopped when he pulled out a small baggie of white powder cocaine.  He soon asked me again if I wanted to do any and I said sure, why not.

     

At first I put a small amount in my mouth to see what it felt and tasted like.  After my mouth went numb I was ready to do a line.  Before I even snorted a line my heart was racing as I anticipated what the drug would do to me.  I imagined how great of a feeling it would be.  Snort!  Line one up the nose.  My top teeth were numb along with my tongue.  I waited about 30 seconds and I started to feel it.  All I wanted to do was jump and dance.  



After a few minutes I did another line, and then another.  By this time my nose was extremely itchy and runny.  My friend took me to the bathroom and we put some water up our noses which made them feel better.  I was feeling pretty good, but it wasn't what I expected.  From all the things I have heard and read about cocaine, I thought the experience would be tremendous.  I don't see how cocaine could be addictive at all.  I really didn't like it at all.  I felt pretty good for about 30 minutes and was really hyper, but besides that there wasn't much more to it.  Although I'm sure cocaine is extremely addictive, I felt no craving for it later that night.  I had a pretty good time at the club because I had a lot of energy.  That night I lay in bed from about 1-4 trying to go to sleep, but it was hard.  



It's just a waste of time and money.  Cocaine is highly over rated and much too expensive.  If I was offered cocaine again I would reject it.
