I live in the Netherlands, were prescription opioids are extremely hard to come by. It's impossible to fake pain to get strong opioids, and so OxyContins are an exotic treat, like finding a lump of gold. By enormous coincidence a very good friend of mine found someone offering 180 OxyContins, in both 5 and 10mg at a Dutch eBay type auction site. The person who sold the OxyContins didn't know how much they were worth and sold them for a bargain to him. The guy who sold them probably didn't know selling prescription medication is illegal as well. When I heard the story from my friend my mouth fell wide open from amazement.



Since then I tried looking for opioids on Dutch auction sites and I already had one nice find, a whole heap of tramadol, 50mg IR, 100mg/200mg/300mg XR, some 50mg pentazocine and some 10mg MS Contin. The woman who sold it was a former chronic pain sufferer, who also didn't know the value of the meds and sold it all for half the price it would even cost at the pharmacy, let alone on the black market. And now recently the same happened again, I found someone who was also a former chronic pain sufferer, and who happened to sell 4 strips of 10x10mg brand name OxyContin for next to nothing, so I immediately jumped on it, and bought the whole lot. Before this experience I had 2 previous experiences with it, this time I wrote a experience report. Here it is:



T 19:35 I snorted my first line of 20mg crushed OxyContin. It's horrible. Because they are just 10mg OC's they have a lot of binder, so it's a lot of powder to snort. Almost immediately after snorting I had to couch, it's disgusting.



T 19:40 I am already starting to feel the first effects coming up. I snort my second line, another 20mg OxyContin.



T 19:45 My head is starting to glow like a lightbulb, but in a very nice way. I `m hit by a tsunami of comfortness, as if I step under a nice warm shower, really relaxing. My head feels like a stuffed pillow, but like everything else it feels incredibly nice.



T 19:50 The effects came up very quickly. I'm now pretty sedated and I feel incredibly hot throughout my whole body. I've taken of my sweatshirt because it was too hot, I'm wearing just a t-shirt now, but I still feel very hot. I'm feeling very stoned as well. I can only guess how good my peak is going to feel. Heaven probably.



T 19:55 I'm still glowing like a radiator, though it feels like it's slowly declining heat, or I'm accustoming, anyway the glow is now more comfortable, the last few minutes I felt a bit too hot.



T 20:05 I'm feeling even more stoned and the nice body glow got even better. My stomach felt a bit uncomfortable a while ago, but that has subsided as well now. Everything is perfect, there's no trouble in the world. This is also clearly why it's so incredibly addictive. It's the perfect opioid. Fortunately it's nearly impossible to get oxycodone for me, so there isn't any possibility to get addicted to it, in any way.



T 20:15 I've been moving around in my room a bit, and the nausea came back. Now I'm sitting down it subsided again. I'm going to get a glass of water because I'm thirsty and sweating.



T 20:20 I take a 25mg Nytol(diphenhydramine) against the nausea, although the nausea isn't too uncomfortable, the experience would be even better if I wouldn't experience any nausea, and diphenhydramine potentiates opioids a bit as well, so it only has advantages.



T 20:25 As long as I sit perfectly still, I barely experience any nausea, but if I even move the slightest bit I feel the nausea growing, the more I move, the worse it gets. My eyelids are getting heavy to. Walking is difficult as well, I sway around like I'm drunk.



T 20:35 The glow seems to have subsided, It seems the oxycodone is already wearing off, really weird since it has a much longer duration. But 5 days ago when I snorted 20mg oxycodone the duration was very short as well.



T 20:45 My eyelids are getting heavier, it's hard to keep them open at times. The nausea is still returning in waves, even when I'm lying on my bed. I almost felt like I had to vomit.



T 20:55 Again, the nausea has subsided after several minutes, and after I had burped I felt a big relief from my stomach. Although I'm certainly feeling relaxed, the effects have subsided a lot. 5 days ago I snorted 20mg OxyContin and took 2 tablets of 3mg Lexotanil, and again 2 tablets some time later. That experience was much more euphoric, even though this experience has been relaxing, it wasn't really euphoric, so I'm going to take some Normison in the hope of bringing back the effects, and hopefully get some euphoria. I strongly disadvice anyone else to combine opioids with any downers, it is very dangerous and can be lethal!



T 21:05 The effects from the oxycodone have subsided a lot, but I might snort some more later, when the Normison has taken effect. This way I can be sure of euphoria. I'm going downstairs to get some water.



T 21:15 It feels like something is coming up or increasing in strength. Maybe the Normison is indeed potentiating the oxycodone, hopefully it does and will make it hit strong again. In theory the oxycodone should still be circulating in my body, but it just might not be really noticeable anymore, so hopefully the Normison will bring back the effects. Otherwise I'm going to snort some more OxyContin later on. I've been grudgy the whole evening, but I just noticed it really obviously. Someone just came in my room asking me something and I wasn't exactly friendly. I'm best to be left alone at the moment, and have been like that the whole evening.



T 21:25 Unfortunately the effects haven't came back. I'm still feeling a bit nauseous and doubt if I can handle snorting more OxyContin without having to vomit. I'm going for it anyway, so I will still experience what I hoped for. Because in theory there should still be oxycodone in my system, so I would feel a small amount pretty well. At T 21:36 I will snort another 10mg so it's exactly 2 hours after first intake.



T 21:35 I snorted another 10mg of crushed OxyContin. Because I only snorted one pill this time, no cloud of powdered binders was blown through my throat, nor did I feel any binders drip down into my throat. Almost immediately I felt it hit me again. We'll see what it does, and if doesn't do enough, the last OxyContin will be snorted for tonight.



T 21:40 It's starting to come up again. I notice a a kind of buzz growing in my body, mainly my arms. From experience I know this feeling is going to change into a flow of warmth.



T 21:45 The buzz has only slightly increased in strength, I'm pretty certain I won't be going to experience anything overwhelming from the single pill I just snorted, so I'm going to get my final pill for the evening. I also takes my second 10mg Normison tablet sublingually.



T 21:51 The buzz has increased and my head feels like a stuffed pillow again. I have a feeling this time the effects are going to be stronger than with the previous 40mg I snorted, earlier on this evening.



T 21:55 I snorted another 10mg of OxyContin, my total for the evening is now 60mg of OxyContin, and 20mg Normison.



T 22:01 The nausea I feared for has come back somewhat, though I'm also starting to feel stoned and warm again. I really hope all his effort is going to pay back and is finally going to give me a good high. We'll see.



T 22:05 I still experience nausea, but as long as I stay put, the nausea is barely noticeable. I'm still feeling more stoned and sedated, and I'm slowly starting to glow again. My eyelids are heavy as well, and my vision is blurring, which is a good sign. I always have blurred vision on high doses, when I'm under heavy influence of opioids.



T 22:10 I'm feeling very content, and relaxed. I ain't groggy anymore like I was earlier on this evening. Everything is good now, I'm feeling what I hoped on feeling this evening. This is so damn nice.



T 22:15 The sedation has increased even more. I'm too lazy to type, and my hands are heavy, my eyelids are closing all the time. This is a really nice drug for a Sunday afternoon, watching a movie on the couch.



T 22:35 I took another 10mg Normison. Unfortunately the oxycodone seems to be slowly wearing off. It's exactly an hour after last intake, so I should be at my peak, but instead I'm already past it, it seems. The addition of Normison this time certainly was a improvement, though again, I warn anyone not to combine downers.



T 23:55 I don't have much trouble keeping my eyes open, and my limbs don't feel heavy anymore. I'm still feeling a bit content and relaxed, but all the effects have subsided quite a bit, my body glow has subsided to just a bit of warmth. I'm still feeling sedated and a bit stoned though.



T 23:15 At times I still have a short period where my eyelids feel incredibly heavy, and keep closing. I still feel a nice body glow though it has slowly decreased some more. And I still feel nice and relaxt, I have noticed music seems to enhance the feeling of relaxation and contentment. I become happier when listening to nice music.



T 23:35 I still feel a mild glow throughout my body, mainly in my legs and head. The nausea is gone, fortunately, and I'm still feeling nice and stoned, though only a third of what I felt almost 2 hours ago. I'm still pretty relaxed and enjoying oxycodone's nice afterglow, though 4 hours after first intake, I think this experience is nearing it's end.



T 23:45 I'm going to call it a day. I had a very good experience with oxycodone, and had learnt several new things for any future times I'm going to take oxycodone again. It will still be a while before the afterglow has worn off, but all of the main effects have subsided to a very low point, and there won't be much happening anymore to write about. Goodbye for now.
