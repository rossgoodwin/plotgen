Introduction



I thought I'd just buy 2 grams as it has *very* mixed reviews, perhaps I just got a great batch, or it reacts well with me, because I am getting reaaaallly good effects.



Dose



I have had between 0.75-1.25g in the last 12 hours, in small lines insufflated every hour-ish.



My side effects:



Despite many negative side effects listed on the Wikipedia entry for Mephedrone, I have no nose bleeds, obviously the nose burns when I snort it!, no hallucinations, no blood circulation problems, no rashes, no anxiety, no paranoia, no fits or delusions, my concentration is ridiculously good on it, not sure about my memory, heart is fine, I am really happy, my mouth is fine and not dry at all and idc if my pupils are dilated or anything, I'm not gurning.



The setup / reason for doing it.



I have a messed up sleeping pattern due to too much studying (turned over a new leaf and trying to learn 600 hours of missed lectures by studying $\sim$8-10 hours every weekday) and I woke up at 10pm after 10 hours sleep (yea messed up!) so thought I'd try my mephedrone overnight, nothing better to do at that time of night with no prospect of sleep (I have problems with insomnia so I won't be able to sleep for about 30+ hours after 10 hours sleep)



Effects



Basically effects for me from mephedrone: Mellow feeling, however not tired in the slightest (unlike butylone which is far from mellow, but fun as hell!) and I have basically in the last 6 hours been really productive*, happy and had some amazing ideas. It makes me want to be social (even though I am alone). Music sounds better too (though not to the extent of weed music).



*Things I have done on mephedrone overnight(put at bottom just as an example)



I have signed up to volunteer to help children with literacy which may look really good on my CV.  I have joined a trampolining society and a gymnastics society, because I am good at both things but haven't done either in about 2 years, which is a shame.

I barred myself off poker sites for 120 days (which will save me at least £500, I'm not really that good at poker!)  I wrote up an excercise regime and added it to my timetable on my phone.  I organised my finances and worked out how much money I can spend per day as well as finding out the dates I get more money from my student loans and bursaries.  I wrote a timetable of things I am going to do today, including putting a classified ad in a newspaper to become a part time maths/physics/french tutor for some extra cash.



Those were all things I have told myself I need / would like to do, but normally I'm not very motivated (hence missing 600 lectures) and mephedrone told me I need to sort my life out.



Basically, it isn't for everyone, but it is certainly for me.
