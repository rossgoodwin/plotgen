First, here's a little history\ldots 



I'm 20 now and I've been smoking bud since I was in middle school. It calms me down.

I met a few ravers in Hawaii when I was there in december 2000, first time I tried exstacy, it was great. Shrooms, well, I'm over those. Bad trip with ex girlfriend.

acid, not again afer shrooms. I tried coke for the first time about a month ago I love that stuff, it's become my new best friend.



First time I tried meth was when I was rolling (on exstacy) really nicely at a rave. I don't think I felt much of it cuz I was already hyper from the e (exstacy) and did a couple lines of coke before. I was just really fast.



My first time trying meth by itself.



I got home from work today at 7:30 after waking up at about 6 to get there on time. I was planning on lighting up a spliff and watching some cartoons to relive stress. Well after a while of that I got bored, which was a totally new feeling while high. I remembered that I got a gram of meth and 2 grams of coke along with my weekly quarter o of my wife, mary jane. Well when this boredom hit I felt like goin up to my bedroom and doin a couple lines of coke. When I got up there I opened up my fun box and saw the bag of coke sittin on top of my coke.



I said what the fuck and set out a little tiny pile of it on my glass table. I cut it into a little bump the diameter of a pensil eraser and went to snort it up a pen tube. When I got a little closer I noticed that these were crystals about the size of a grain of salt and didn't know how well that would go up my nose. So I cut it up till it looked more reasonable. I cut out a couple bumps, same saze ad a pencil eraser again, and snorted one each nostril.



a couple seconds passed, and then this intense pain in my nose. It felt like I had a huge pressure on my nose, like I had to blow it, but it also seamed like I could breathe great, kinda like coke. After about 10-15 seconds I felt fine. I don't know what everyone's talking about, it wasn't all that bad. About another 30 seconds after the pain went away I felt like I was rolling on e except for the absolute love of everything, and the acatter brain feeling.



I felt like clenching my jaw, but a frequent exstacy user has taught me to use baby pavifiers. I grabbed it and chewed away. Another different feeling was that I was completely focused on anything I set my mind to. Anything and everything. I really wanted to talk to everyone, but thats just the same as e and coke for me a little. Another new feeling is that for the first half hour I couldn't sit down, I just had to go out side and smoke a few cigs just to have something to do.



After about an hour I decided to focus my evergy on something. I sat down at the computer at about 11 to type up a resume and went almost straight to the internet instead. I read about 10 of the expierence stories and started to talk to 2 or 3 people on instant messenger. When I was done reading the stories I decided to type up my own, and here I am @ 1 am. I did a few things inbetween all these things like get water and eat a mint.



I feel great! Almost what I expected, but it completely took over my weed high, I think. I feel like I can do anything. I can't stop moving. I have music on right now and I can't stop moving my feet. I really want to dance but I'm packing up all my stuff to move and I have no room. I'm hungry but I can't even look at the food. I really want to drink water but I can't make myself drink it right now. I'm really horny, not exstacy horny, just a general feeling. My skin feels more sensitive and soft. My hair is about the same.



I'm getting bored with random things about me an changing them. I just have a general all around good feeling about myself and feel fast as hell. Not the euphoric feeling of exstacy, and not the really positive feeling of coke, but somewhere in the middle a bit. And of course a bit high. I feel like talking to everyone. I'm rambling to my friend on the fone and typing this all up at the same time, I feel like I'm focusing on both completely! I'm gonna finish packing and continue to talk on the fone. Maybe even invite her over because I am very horny still.



I still want coke even tho I'm spun on meth. I don't recommend that anyone do any drug, but I really like this meth.



Have fun!



I think I'm gonna go ride my bike or run a little later!
