Over the xmas holiday period I managed to acquire 2X 500mg of piperine in capsule form. Finding myself at a loose end, and with nothing else to do, I decided now was a good as time as any to try what many have attempted to call the legal alternative to xtc. At roughly 11pm, three hours after eating, I decided to pop one of the capsules. As is normally my routine when sampling stimulant-type substances, I drank a couple of beers and smoked a few weed spliffs. Don't know about anyone else but this helps me to `come up' easier as it takes the edge off the first waves of nausea sometimes associated with introducing chemicals to the body. 



Settling down to watch a movie, I felt nothing for about two and a half hours. This may have had something to do with the meal I'd eaten earlier although I have heard that piperine can take a while to work. Anyway, fearing that nothing was happening I took the second capsule. Within twenty minutes I started to experience that E tingling sensation in my stomach. It felt good and I decided to slip on the headphones and listen to DJ Shadow for a while until I really started to peak. This pleasant sensation continued for about an hour or so. My jaw was clenched slightly and I could feel sweat gathering on my brow. All fairly standard stuff associated with taking MDMA. At this point I was beginning to believe that piperine could be an adequate alternative for E. How wrong I was.



Roughly just after 3 am I stated to feel a rising wave of nausea grab hold of me. This was something that had never happened to me before when getting high on any substance. Thinking it was dehydration I got up from where I was lying and went to the kitchen for a drink of water. A couple of glasses later and I was still feeling quite unpleasant. I noticed that I was having to concentrate on breathing properly. My lungs didn't feel like they were inflating fully and I was aware that my heart rate was through the roof. My pulse was racing and my eyes were so dilated that they appeared to be black. A few minutes after drinking the water I felt the need to go to the toilet. Upon attempting to urinate nothing happened for a few minutes. After it did, I was back and forth to the toilet for the next hour constantly. 



At this stage I was starting to feel weak and just wanted the experience to end. I climbed into bed and tried to ride it out. The nausea was still as intense and I just couldn't control my breathing and heart rate like I normally can when I've taken something. Sweat was pouring off me but at the same time I felt quite cold. I sparked a spliff to try and bring me down but that just interfered with my breathing even more. Turning to the clock at the side of the bed it seemed like time had slowed down. I really felt like it was never going to end. After much tossing and turning and promising myself I'd never do this stuff again, I managed to fall asleep for a few hours.



Upon awakening at 11am, I still felt ill. I was exhausted and weak. Worst of all was my head. It hurt like hell. Having read other reports on piperine this seems to be a common feature of the drug. I don't suppose the beers I'd had earlier helped in any way. To conclude, stay away from piperine. It seems alright at first but after a while it reacts in a very strange, almost toxic, way with the human body. Definitely not a suitable substitute for E.
