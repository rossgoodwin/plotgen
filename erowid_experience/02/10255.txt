salvia + 5meo-dmt + caffeine



--- Introduction ---



Earlier today I had an incredible experience -- perhaps my most profound (whatever that means) to date.



Here are the basics.



Subject:

male, 38 years old, 225 pounds



Substance/Dose:

approx. 150mg caffeine (strong cup of coffee)

then, 30 minutes later

simultaneous dose of:

2mg salvinorin (via 2, 25mg doses of enhanced salvia)

about 10mg 5-meo-dmt (eyeball divided from 250mg lot, so + or -- 50\%)



Technique:

Like in my last experience combining salvia and 5meo, I load the waterpipe with the salvia and sprinkle the 5meo on top.  I heat the bowl with the lighter flame to melt the 5meo, then place the flame above the bowl, drawing the heat down to vaporize and inhale the 5meo.  After a few seconds I lower the flame to the salvia and finish the bowl in a single inhalation.  It's a delicate process and I had a tough time finishing the dose because I hadn't thoroughly exhaled before starting.



From here until the conclusion are my notes from the experience, starting with a journal entry that leads up to the dose, which serves to capture my set and setting.  Annotations are within brackets.



-- start realtime notes --



9:33am



Very excited this morning, and rather stimulated after a cup of strong coffee



I knew I wanted to try another experience this morning, to find the time, but in addition to finding the time, it feels right, and it is not often that both `opportunity' and `the right time' come together



It's a Sunday morning; clock was turned back an hour.  ***** and *****  are hanging out in bed.  I told them I was going in to my office to meditate and should not be disturbed, and that I'd be out in about an hour.



***** knows what that mean; she still doesn't like it.  Last night over dinner I told her my idea for a business based on providing a safe environment for people to have such experiences.  She said it was the dumbest idea I ever came up with and that she didn't even want to talk about it.



So what do I want to accomplish this morning?



I'm trying the salvia and 5meo-dmt combination, but this time with 50mg (2mg salvinorin) salvia -- last time was half that much.  The amount of 5meo is in the ballpark of 10mg, but could be + or -- 50\% due to my eyeballing method of dividing up the 250mg lot.



During my last experience, or in the reflections, it occurred to me that salvia plays with the fabric of human experience while 5meo plays with the fabric of reality.  Lately, I've been fond of saying that my two heroes -- Joseph Campbell and John Lilly -- are two sides of the same coin; it feels, somehow that salvia is like Joe while 5meo is like John.



While the 5meo experience is, by itself, interesting, it may not be as useful as others.  Playing with the fabric of reality means that `ideas' do not really exist -- their playground has been obliterated.  And I like ideas.  Salvia plays with ideas -- particularly the sense of self.  So by combining these two molecules I am, perhaps, trying to see if a sense of self can exist within the realm of the 5meo chaos -- I guess you might call that a transcendent consciousness.



I suppose this all sounds simplistic, but to me, naming things and categorizing things are just methods of organization and have no real basis in reality -- whatever that is.



Other than what I have just written I have no intentions.  Take me where you will.  I feel good, excited, and feel that I am doing something that feels very right for me.  I am open to arguments that it is `wrong' but haven't really heard any.  (I've heard `declarations' -- this is bad -- but not arguments explaining why)



I don't like the vision of a future where widespread pharmacological manipulation is daily fare -- unless we find/synthesize some new, particularly useful tools.  Instead, for now, such experimentation simply provides glimpses of many typically unexperienced slices of human conscious experience.

maybe that's a connection

to the shame

and inhibitions

bizarre



My fear of people is fear that I am being seen as someone who they do not like because I just shit my pants and they want to run away from, like they did, I tried to play into the `game' to cover my pain and confusion and shame



covering over shame

playing the game

I said, in effect, ``I am going to get you''

I'm the monster

the ugly one

the one you want to avoid



yes, try, marshall

10:11 AM



what is worth doing

you must be prompted -- remember that



provide for health and safety so you and others can explore

that's all that matters

huge implications



what is genuinely worth doing other than that?



human evolution

has gotten to where I am so healthy and so safe that I can do this

survival is secondary

dangerous thought



perhaps tghat's all humans can do

explore

and work toward health and safety



all of this business and economy

is it all required for health and safety and security??

i just dobn;t understand it enopuigh

the pricioples

the dynaimics

of `econoinmy' i guess



if the goals is ONLY health and safety and security



and that should perhaps be the only goal? 

along with exploration

which means technologies

which means industry

which means\ldots



this world of ours?



i'm about 75/80\% down

very fully withing consusnes realuity

90\% really at 10:16 AM



i feel that i have found it

i didn't waste the come down

but i know how to leverage it for real

it must be real time

it must be audio visual

it is religion and performance

it is ritual



and you are afriad and have shame



how can you get past that



by having a safe psychological environment

like friends

what a concept



who do you consider such a friend?



a friend is someone you can be yourself with



christ -- didn't mean it that way  



i am unable to be myself with\ldots anyone



fuck, how do i change that

by starting



just be you

just be you



and *****?

she'll have to come along

if you want her to and ask her nicely she will

and if she can't, then she can't



you must be open vocal

you'll sound crazy

but some with  appreciate pieces of it



wonder what singning would be like during this



once you're playing -- performing -- you can do whatever, say whatever



why haven't you performed?

lack of talent?

maybe, but i think i have enough to get things going



just do your part

do what you do best

don't fake anything

no faking needed

be honest with yourself and everyone else



10:21 AM

90\%



perhaps i don't form stronger relationships because i don't feel that i deserve love



you are who you are

you do what you do

just be open and honest about it

the rest will take care of itself



yes, i really believe that

or at least, i believe it's a nice way to behave

as if\ldots



\ldots



10:38am

had a bowl of cereal, chatted with *****

i feel 95\% back, slight stoned feeling



i like how performance became a solution to realtime audio-visual capture

while not a new idea for me, it was reinforced in a new way

before i was simply thinking of ways to combine interests

here is became a more natural part of it all



my transition from non-engaged to engaged is via this kind of performance activity



speech recognition software could help as well



elements

	percusive typing, keyboard, drum -- fingers, hands, arms

	voice, speaking, singing

	and the visual\ldots i guess that is me doing this\ldots

	and the output of my activity -- words



For what it is worth, today's technique feels like the best so far -- it felt perfect

perhaps expectations were simply fulfilled but it genuinely felt like it combined the `self' oriented aspects of the salvia with the reality shattering aspects of 5meo-dmt.



extremes in exhibitionism



10:47

about one hour later i feel 95+\%

i'd wait another hour before driving though



-- end of realtime notes ---



--- final thoughts ---



The combination of salvia and 5meo makes for a truly amazing experience.  I think the caffeine ahead of time contributes as well; hard to know how much.  The space in which I was immediately propelled lasts only a minute or so, but of course it seems like a much longer time -- as though the experience reaches completely past the idea and the perception of time.



I have read, if I recall correctly, that chocolate (a MAOI?) might increase the duration of that first level.  (Found it: ``Terence McKenna has mentioned chocolate being a weak MAOI, which could be a reason for the popular habit of ingesting mushrooms with cocoa.''  Perhaps I will try a cocoa-coffee mixture in the future.



The positiveness of the experience matched the positiveness of my set and setting -- very self-fulfilling I suppose.



What did I get out of this experience?



I have a very busy life, and these experiences -- including this one -- remind me to consider other paths and other possibilities.  They remind me of my dreams, of things I would like to do with my life.  They help me take stock of where I am, what I'm doing with myself, where my head is.  It is all too easy for the months and years to go by so quickly.  I'm fortunate to have an interesting career and it pays the bills, but there is so much more; there is the wonder of what `existence' and `reality' and `consciousness' are, and of what is possible to experience.
