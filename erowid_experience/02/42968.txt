 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\#  



I can remeber this experience very clearly, as if it happened only a few days ago, probably because it seemed to increase my intellegence and therefore memory so greatly.  I was staying at a friend's house Martin Luther King weekend last year, and after a day of boredom with nothing to do we decided to try to get ahold of some weed.  It proved impossible as no one was answering their phones, and the boredom was unbareable.  After a few hours of sitting around doing nothing, my friend said he'd heard you could get high off of adderol, this drug he was taking for supposed ADHD.  Without much hesitation we scurried upstairs to the cabinet his medication was stored in.



We started off conservitively, he took three pills and I took two.  We went down to his basement to watch the movie frequency, and after getting past only the first scene we decided we needed more.  He took four more and me five, adding up to seven apeice.  We went back down to the basement and waited, and soon enough a feeling of complete euphoria washed over my body.  Everything felt good, no matter which way I moved or what I was doing.  We began to talk about religion, and ended up forming a religion that made absolutly no sense and I won't bore you with, but it seemed totally real at the moment.



When we made a trip upstairs to smoke a few cigs in his garage, we saw a tupperware container full of cookies and decided we were hungry, this is where I noticed things start to get really weird, but it was a fun kind of weird.  I took a cookie out of the container and started to eat it at what seemed to a be a normal rate as we continued forming our outlandish religion.  When I was around a quarter the way through the cookie we looked at the clock and three hours had passed.  We had been sitting there for what seemed like a maximum of ten minutes, but it had in fact been a very long time.



This oddity happened on several occasions, we would be doing something and stop what we were doing to talk about something for a little bit, soon realizing it had been an hour or so.  One of the times, my friend got up to turn off The Wall on his stereo, but stopped right before he got to it to say something.  By the time we realized he hadn't turned it off yet it was already over. The feeling wore off after around six or so hours, right before dawn. We decided it was time to take more, this is when we made our mistake. 



We made our way upstairs to the bottle and took out 14 more, making a total of 14 apice.  The feeling soon came back again, and I felt on top of the world.  We laid down in the dark room after his mom woke up until she went to work so she wouldn't know what we were up to.  After she left, we decided the house was getting fairly boring and left.  The time was around 7 am.  We walked a short distance to McDonalds to get some food.  We ordered outragous amounts of it, but ended up eating nothing.  It seemed we wanted to eat but at the same time had no desire to actually do it.  After that we made our way to the grocery store next to McDonalds and bought a few pounds of candy, which we of course never touched.



We then went to the woods behind McDonalds and smoked some cigarettes, in hindsight it was most likely an hour and a half we were out there (in 10 degree weather) but it again seemed like only a few minutes.  We had a sort of perceptual hallucination, he pointed out that I looked oddly tall and at that time I realized he looked abnormally short, more than a foot shorter than me when he is really only a few inches shorter.  After a while, my friend said he was starting to feel sick, as if he might throw up at any moment, so I suggested we go back to McDoanlds and get something hot to drink.  As soon as we got in there he sprinted for the bathroom and didnt come out until I was done ordering.  We went to the table and sat down, and he began sweating like a pig.  It literally looked like he had just gotten out of the shower, and his breathing became very shallow.



He started to panic, but I told him to relax because the anxiety would only make it worse, he told me later my assurance was what stopped him from falling off the edge.  A few times his eyes would roll back in his head and his head would drop to the table, and this is when I became agitaded.  I started to worry that this might happen to me soon because the adderol had also kicked in on him sooner than it did me.  He told me unless he passed out not to call 911, becuase he was going to try his hardest to get through it.  We sat in McDonalds for a half hour or so, but it actually ended up being two hours.  He calmed down his breathing and said he thought he was good enough to make it back to his house.  The second we stepped out of the door he fell over, and I had to pick him up and hold him steady to walk.



By the time we got back to his house, though, he seemed completely fine, as if it had worn off completely.  His mom called and asked where we were, and said she knew we were up to something since we had been gone five or so hours. When she said this we were both extremely shocked.  So he freaked out and started drinking a lot of water becuase he thought he was going to be tested.  For some reason I thought it would probably work, even though normally I would know that becuase of the amount he took he would never be able to get it out of his system using just water dilution.  



I went home soon after, because I just wanted to try to sleep it off, but then something in the back of my mind was telling me that it could be possible that I would never wake up.  I got home determined to stay awake until the effects wore off, and by 8 o'clock I was feeling like absolute shit.  A very odd sensation had come over me, the most intense and uncomfortable feeling I have ever fealt.  It was a huge rush, an incredably huge rush, my hands made fists that I couldnt get out of no matter how hard I tried.  It was a mix between extreme pleasure and extreme pain, and it felt like my heart would explode at any moment.



I went to my room in the basement and started watching tv to try to keep my mind off it, but found myself slipping deeper into the feeling, my wrists and legs cramping up because I could not move them out of their positions.  I truly thought I was going to die that night.  I gave up on the not sleeping thing, deciding that I would rather die than be awake for another minute.  



To my surprise I awoke the next morning in my bed instead of on the ground drenched in sweat.  The feeling had not passed, though, and I told my parents I was too sick to go to school that day.  The feeling lasted until around noon of that day, a full 38 hours since I had taken the inital dose.  Apparantly the friend I was with was very concerned with my health and told some of my friends he thought I may have died or be in the hospital because of an overdose on adderol.  As soon as school got out my phone was flooded with calls from people hoping I was allright.  I decided then and there to never use adderol, or any other pills for that matter, as recrational substances.  I'd stick to weed.  For a week or so after that, I fealt incredably burned out like my IQ had dropped 30 points.
