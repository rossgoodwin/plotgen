I have had experience with a few research cannabinoids, including JWH0-018, AM-2201, and JWH-250. I have also used ecstasy around seven times, cannabis regularly for the last three years, salvia, alcohol, and tobacco. My use of high quality cannabis was the most comparable to my 25C-NBOMe trip relative to the state of mind I was in. I have never used LSD or mushrooms, so this was my first, and last experience with powerful psychedelics. Cannabis is a walk in the park compared to this drug, but the state of consciousness one enters when very stoned is like a very small dose of 25C-NBOMe.



I had read a lot about this substance, and I thought I knew what I was doing. Every forum I went to people were warning, `this substance is very powerful.' I thought I understood that, but I didn't. This substance isn't child play, it is slightly less potent than LSD. If you aren't careful, this stuff will fuck you up and send you to hell. I had read 500mcg was like a normal LSD trip, and I wanted more than that. I ended up measuring at least 1.3mg, which is 1,300mcg. I know it was at least that, but it was probably more because the trip became extremely overwhelming. It is hard for me to exactly remember the dosage, because after I took the substance I entered [within 2 or 3 minutes] in to a terrifying reality and I couldn't even remember what time it was.



8:48PM - So I dosed at least 1.3mg of 25C-NBOMe HCl powder, and mixed it with 1ml of water, and used an eye dropper to suck it up. I put the dropper in my nostril, and squeezed out the dose. I felt a burn and my nose became numb. 



8:50PM - I walked downstairs into the bathroom, and a minute later I went into the kitchen. There was some pizza my mom made, and I started to feel the psychological effects kick in. I was confused, and didn't feel quite right. I grabbed a paper late, put it in the microwave for 30 seconds, and when I took it out and sat down the drug was really kicking in. This was about 2 minutes after I had dosed.



Everything began to breath, I tried to calm myself down, but it didn't help much. I didn't feel good, there wasn't any euphoria, or a body high. I started to be overcome by a sense of helplessness and fear. I realized this dose was way too strong for me to handle, and it had just started. There was so much breathing, everything was expanding and looked slightly like water colors. I tried to take a bite of pizza, and my mouth was dry. I had totally lost my appetite, and the food disgusted me. The main effects I noticed so far were breathing, everything was expanding in and out, and I couldn't stop it. It was very uncomfortable. Anxiety and paranoia kicked in, I didn't know what to do. I was starting to lose my sense of time.



8:55PM - After a few minutes sitting in the kitchen, I went into my sisters bedroom and sat there on her bed. The drug was in full effect, and I didn't know if I was dying or not. The breathing got more intense, and objects started to swirl. I felt sick to my stomach, and almost puked. I looked on the ground and saw these patterns form, they were made of weird symbols and they were glowing with a green neon color. I thought they were Aztec symbols or something, thats the best way I can describe it. What made the trip so bad was my state of mind. I couldn't control my thoughts, so many ideas were flowing through my head. I felt like I was on a roller coaster of emotions. I never felt good though, I didn't feel high, or happy, or euphoric. I had lost my mind. There was pressure in my head, and I had trouble talking. My cheekbones and jaw felt numb, I didn't know if I was dying or if that was part of the trip. My heartbeat was normal, but I became very thirsty and my mouth was dry.



9:00PM - My mom came in the room and knew something was wrong. She said `what are you on?' and at first I lied and said `nothing,' but I didn't know if I was going to die or not. I realized something about myself, that deception like that isn't good. That something I hate about myself, and it came into light from this substance. I don't lie a lot, but sometimes I can be deceptive like that, and I saw how a small lie like that isn't good. So I told her what I was on, and she got mad and told me she was disappointed. That's natural, but I didn't need a guilt trip right then. I needed her to stay positive so I could come off of this shit, and I told her that. I tried my best to tell her what it was, but I had a very hard time speaking and getting the right words out. I could think very fast, and tons of ideas and thoughts went through my head, but I couldn't communicate them through speech. 



9:30PM - By now the substance was probably at the peak, it had been absorbed for about 40 minutes. My mom was still there and was doing my sisters laundry, and talking to me to keep my mind busy. The trip was incredibly overwhelming, and way too intense. I couldn't keep my grip on reality, my mind was slipping. I kept saying to myself `this can't be real,' (referring to the effects I felt from the chemical) but that didn't stop what I saw and felt. I felt very sad one moment, then forgot about it, then felt terrified the next. My thoughts were racing, and the intensity of the visuals was way too much. I thought I was dying, I felt like it. I thought `this is what hell must be like, but worse.' There was no grasp on to reality. It is very hard to describe with words what I felt and saw, words can't do it. I realized words aren't adequate to describe experiences humans have.



10:00PM - The chemical was still going strong, and I remained in my sisters room. The breathing was extremely intense, everything was morphing in and out, but there wasn't much of a color change. The only colors I saw were the hallucinations on the ground and on the walls. They were mystical patterns, that became 3d and they were highlighted with a neon glow. I felt terrified because of how rapid the swirling and breathing was. I felt like I was on a boat in the ocean, that's how much swaying there was. Everything was morphing and it made me have so much fear despite my best attempts to calm myself down. The tremendous amount of fear was due to the fact that I couldn't control anything. I felt fear, anxiety, and everything was moving so fast and I couldn't stop it. My mind entered another state of consciousness, I couldn't control my thoughts, and I became almost delirious. I couldn't grasp reality, I had a very difficult time knowing whether or not I was dead. Sounds were echoing, I could hear sounds from far away, my sense of hearing was definitely heightened.



10:30PM - I couldn't stand being in my sisters room anymore. I became claustrophobic, and the breathing effects made the room look very small due to my skewed perception of dimensions and sizes. I felt that room and went into my moms bed and laid down, and I saw some cool visuals. The bedspread looked like clouds, and was breathing in and out. There were the same 3d visuals popping out of the bed, forming into complex 3d shapes and they started to glow and change colors. However, my state of mind made this enjoyable. The sudden mood changes, and inability to control my thoughts made it like hell. Hell has to be the total loss of control of consciousness and thoughts. How can you be sane if you can't control your thoughts? What I experienced was a trip to hell. I experienced slight ego loss at the peak of the trip, which terrified me. I couldn't tell who I was, I couldn't tell if I was even alive, or where I was, or what anything was. That was horrific.



I looked around my moms room and saw her paintings of some Saints, and their faces were morphing. They looked like they were smiling, and then frowning, and then looked evil. She had some shirts hanging up and they were breathing in and out, and the fan on the ceiling was swaying and breathing. The best way to describe everything was tremendous, uncontrollable, and terrifying breathing. The main thought that kept running through my head was `how can people enjoy this? how can they LIKE these visuals, and this state of mind that makes them feel insane' I thought I had become insane.



11:00PM - Time seemed to be slow from my perspective, but in reality it was moving fast. I looked at my phone, and already 10 or 20 minutes had passed. I was having these complex thoughts about life and the trip, which seemed like it took only seconds, and then before I knew it 20 minutes had passed. I continued sitting there, seeing these visuals, and trying to control my thoughts. No matter what I did, the visuals were still intense (they had given up lightly) and the racing thoughts remained. The most disturbing part was not being able to control my thoughts, however enlightening they might have been. One minute I was thinking about the trip, the next it was abut God, the next about how disappointing my mom was, etc. The raciness never stopped, and I felt like I was becoming retarded or something. I felt like my brain was frying, that I was sitting there dying.



11:30PM - I got out of bed and went to pee, and it felt like I had been peeing for minutes. Liquid just kept coming, and coming, and my perception of time was definitely very slow. I felt like I was viewing the bathroom from a perspective of a fisheye lens. Everything was bending, and breathing, and I looked at the toilet and it seemed like it was really far away. I looked in the mirror and saw my face morphing, and breathing, and I realized a lot of my problems stemmed from the fact that I didn't like who I was. I then really understood that I can't change myself, theres nothing I can do to change who I am. I've heard it before, and I thought it was cheezy, but its the truth. You are who you are, its so simple and true. I stood there and looked at myself, and was just trying to figure out who I was.



I left the bathroom and went down and laid in my moms bed again, she had been in the living room praying for me ever since I felt my sisters room. She was keeping an eye on me, making sure I was ok. I continued to sit on her bed, watching the bedspread made of clouds. That was amazing, and I couldn't understand how it happened. I realized that if my brain was able to create experiences like that from a drug, it must be the source of all perception and consciousness. When you're dead, you're dead. If your brain gets shut off, you can't perceive anything. I tried to understand God, but it didn't help me at all. I wanted to pray that I would be ok, but deep inside I knew it wouldn't do anything. If I survived it wasn't because God did it, it was because I just happened to not take enough 25C-NBOMe to cause an overdose. God had nothing to do with it, my brain was able to regulate the chemical and I didn't die or have a seizure, thats it. I realized as much as I'd like God to be real, I can't lie to myself and believe in something I truly know isn't real. I won't believe in lies to comfort myself, I can't do that because it isn't the truth, that isn't reality.



12:00PM - By now I was definitely coming down. The intensity had stopped a lot, and there was mild breathing, and still some 3d shapes being made from objects. The racing thoughts were nearly gone, and I felt I had a control on my consciousness again. However, I still felt slow. I still had trouble speaking and completing coherent sentences. I got out of the bed, and ate that pizza from before. It didn't really taste any better than normal, but a blue powerade was refreshing as hell.



I stayed up until 3:40AM to make sure I didn't slip into a coma or something. I didn't want to go to sleep while there were still noticeable effects. I laid in my bed until 3:40, and I slept great. By then the effects had worn off, except for the mental slowness. 



I woke up the next morning, still feeling sluggish, but not as bad as before. I was more sensitive to sounds the next morning, and I felt slightly hung over, but it wasn't very bad at all.



Overall, the negative effects of this drug outweigh the positive ones. Even at a smaller dose, I can assume that the difficulty of grasping reality is still present. I felt like I was dying, and I couldn't control my mind or my thoughts for the majority of the trip. The intensity of the breathing was very uncomfortable, and made me feel insane. Some people enjoy these kinds of drugs, but I sure as hell don't. I like being able to be somewhat lucid and in control of my thoughts when I take something. If you insist on taking this drug, PLEASE take it in a much smaller dose so you know what to expect at a higher dose. I would say don't take more than 250mcg your first trip, because if you take more it can definitely be overwhelming and make you have a bad trip. I don't enjoy the intense breathing, or the racing thoughts, or the roller coaster of depressive emotions. 



There were a few good things to the trip, I learned some things about myself, but overall it wasn't worth it. I don't like putting chemicals made in a lab into my body, I don't like being a guinea pig. I'll stick with natural substances like cannabis, and I'd be interested in using psilocybin, but I won't be using chemicals like this again made in a lab; whether it be RC's, or even LSD. The inability to be lucid and aware of what was going on during the trip made it seem like I was in hell, it made me feel like I was insane and was dying. It was a trip to hell.



---

I strongly urge anyone who considers using this chemical to think again, and realize you are a guinea pig. This chemical is very new to the RC scene, made around 2010. There are no documented long term effects, and by consuming this substance you are putting yourself at very high risk of heart attack, stroke, seizures, and death. These chemicals are made in a lab, they are not natural at all like cannabis. They specifically say `not for human consumption.' After my experience with this chemical I can still not understand why people enjoy any part of it, it is not fun. If you insist of using a strong psychedelic, go with mushrooms or real LSD. Those are safe substances which have been documented for many years. If you don't have access to those substances, you're better off not tripping than taking 25C-NBOMe as a substitute.
