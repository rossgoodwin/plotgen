 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# 



One night, almost 2 years ago, I was very depressed. It was because of a girl; she just wanted to be `friends' after we had what I thought was a romantic night. I had a bottle of G around that I was doing a few times a week. I'd usually take it at night and wake up at 6am feeling refreshed and ready for work.



So here I was, depressed at home, my friends are all working. What would cheer me up? The strip club! I had never been to one before. So I pour some G into a bottle of iced tea (probably 4 grams) and off I go.



I get there and admire the ladies, and sip my iced tea freely, feeling quite happy and sly of the fact I am consuming a powerful illegal drug right in front of everyone. Soon I started to feel relaxed and mellow, almost like an opiate feeling but with more clarity. It was like alcohol as well but with more pure vibes. Soon I felt drunk. I was smiling, and talking to some people when I went to the snack machine. I am a pretty nonsocial person, but this stuff made me do a 180. 



Suddenly, I wake up to a stripper at the main table tapping me. `Hey, this isn't the place to sleep!' she said in an offended but playful way. `You had too much to drink?' `No just tired' I say. Wow that was embarrassing. I wake up and move around some, trying to get the blood flowing. 



Things went well later that night. I talked to a guy that worked there about who is best for a lapdance and what followed was my first lapdance. I was all friendly and horny. Damn what a great time after the embarrassment had worn off. I stayed another hour to make sure I was good enough to drive. I started feeling the comedown effect of G, which is a friendly stimulation. I felt much better about my life situation, and had feelings of acceptance of it.



I could have drank to the point where I couldn't be woken up, and I hate to think what would have happened. This wasn't the only time I nodded out from G. I've done it at a club once with friends. I just passed out in a chair but was awakened easily. Also I've drank a lot of it at once and gotten memory loss. Such as suddenly waking up naked with the TV on loud, not remembering how I got that way. 



Its real fun stuff though if used carefully. I remember when I did it by myself before bed, I could watch any movie, even stupid ones, and be entertained. It sure cures boredom.
