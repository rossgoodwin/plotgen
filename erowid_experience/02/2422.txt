How come there are no experiences with alcohol on here?!?  I guess I'll be the first to educate some of you considering drinking.



This was my first actual experience recreationally using drugs (other than cigarettes).  My parents didn't drink, so I couldn't get my hands on any beer, but they did keep two bottles of Seagrams 7 80 proof whiskey in the cabinet (and they never drank it, so I was in the clear for sneaking it away).  I also have extremely strong willpower and my parents aren't drinkers so I figured that I didn't have much of a chance to become an alcoholic.



When I first poured myself a little cup, I nearly threw it up with one sip.  I wasn't expecting this awful tasting, warm, burning liquid to tear my throat up.  I threw the cup away, and put the liquor back.  I didn't think it would be that bad \ldots 



After talking with my friends, and telling them how bad it was, I was reassured that it would pay off if I got drunk.  Well, me being the curious teenager, I decided to drink with the goal of getting drunk.  I was going to do it, no matter what.  



So, one night, I snuck a bottle up to my room, and poured myself a giant glass of it.  I also brought up a cold glass of milk to try to get past some of that horrible taste.  I swallowed one mouthful and managed to keep it down.  I waited about five minutes (to settle the burning in my stomach and throat) and took another mouthful.  Ugh \ldots  I kept asking myself why I was doing this, and I kept in mind that it SHOULD be worth it.  I soon finished the glass, returned the bottle/glasses and sat on my bed, watched some TV (wrestling.  why?  I have no idea) and waited for the effects to start.  



About a half an hour into it, I started feeling a pleasant, buzzing feeling in my head.  I thought that this would be it, but I was wrong.  45 Minutes into my buzz, It really started.  My head started spinning, and my eyes were having trouble focusing and adjusting.  It was basically like my brain was slowing down (which is what alcohol does).  I was VERY comfortable, laying on my bed, swinging my head back and forth, watching my vision try to keep up with my movements.  It was awesome.  I didn't really have many physical effects, other than a slight numbing feeling on my skin.  Most of it was my mind being slurred.  I couldn't concentrate on the TV with all of these new sensations I was feeling (of course not).    



I thought about all those drunks on TV that always stumble around, and thought it would be funny if I tried to walk. (note: I was laying down when I decided this, so I first had to sit up) When I thrust myself up, I couldn't stop, and fell over again.  It was very hard to sit up straight without continuing over.  I finally managed to hold myself up, and I stood up.  Like I said before, my vision lagged behind what I was actually doing, so I thought I was walking fine, but I was really falling all over the place.  Awesome feeling.  I fell face first on my bed, and I was laughing my ass off.  I don't really know why, it was just funny.  It was probably because I thought of what I was doing, and I probably thought it was funny as hell to be watching myself. I was mumbling, and laughing for about 15 minutes straight. After that, I started to compose myself. I felt the buzz wearing off now, but I was still kinda slow and `dead headed'.  



All in all, the whole experience lasted about 2 and a half hours.  I loved it.  I didn't really have any worries or thoughts about anything.  It was a great experience.  I didn't have a hangover the next day, there was no abnormal peeing or puking or whatnot \ldots  although, when I told my friends that I downed a big glass of whiskey, they were shocked.  They told me that whiskey would knock you on your ass (they just drink beer to get drunk).  They were right, I was knocked on my ass \ldots  it was great.  



From this experience, I learned how come people actually become alcoholics (cause it's so damn fun/enjoyable).  I've only been drunk about 5 times in 1999, and right now, there are two empty bottles of whiskey in my parents cabinet that I have to come up with a solution for (lol).  Hopefully they won't find out until I'm 21 when I can reimburse them. :)  Hope this has been useful.
