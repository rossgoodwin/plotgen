Usual Disclaimer: This was by no means safe. I tried to take risks manageably, but I don't recommend this kind of stuff.



tl;dr: Really fun. Also long lasting as hell, very visual, not much body load or mindfuck at 1mg level. I've been told constriction is an issue at $\sim$5mg but the most I'd ever do of this is 2mg, personally. Social, aural, cognitive, not really that dissociative. Be safe, this is unknown territory.



---



I happened to be in possession of 1mg of Bromo-DragonFLY. This was from the same batch that was mislabeled as 2C-B-Fly and resulted in several deaths. It was later found to also contain `significant synthesis impurities'. Luckily, I received it as Br-DFly and in a dosage approate for this. 1mg was reported to be a moderate dose, and I was not expecting a super strong trip. I actually had some worries that it wouldn't be enough, but it was.



This is a recount of the trip, which lasted a solid two days, plus residual visuals for a few more:



4:30p Tuesday [T=0]: I take a cap of Br-DFly on an empty stomach. I sit down to do some work (programming), as I figure this will take a rather long time to kick in. I smoke a bowl out of my vape - this happens throughout the night.



T+1h: I feel slight effects, and notice slight visuals - patterns of light and shadow that aren't really there. I am surprised, as I thought it would take longer to come on. I am still clear-headed and can function well, but I decide to abandon work for the rest of the trip.



T+1.5h: I IM 50mg of ketamine, as I love doing this on the come-up of psychedelics (especially long ones like DO* and Br-DFly). I had a really high tolerance at the time, so 50mg didn't really fuck me up uncontrollably, but just added spice to what was already a rather fun experience.



T+2h: I go outside for a cigarette, and marvel at the visuals. Br-DFly has visuals unlike anything I've ever done (LSD, shrooms, mescaline, 2C-(B,E,I,P,T-2), DO(B, C), 4-AcO-DMT, DMT, MIPT, LSA, K). It looks like a high dose of mescaline with four hits of good acid thrown in, for me. The headspace is wonderfully clear - no panic, tension, anxiety, any of it. There is some body tremor, but it is not overwhelming at this level.



T+2:30h: I've just been listening to music, and it sounds wonderful, enveloping, rich, and compelling. This reminds me of mescaline, and to a lesser extent 2C-*/DO*\ldots  which makes sense, given the chemical similarity.



T+3h: I inject another 50mg of ketamine, and the intensity of my trip, which was already increasing, spikes. I collect my essentials, lock the apartment, and get on my bike. I'm going to a show my friend is playing at a house about a mile away. I listen to music while I ride (Jesu - Heartache EP), and it is one of the most intense and beautiful rides of my life. The visuals at this point are insane, and I feel wonderful. Though I know it's dangerous to ride fucked up, I feel able to control my bike safely and without any mental discomfort, despite the wonderful visuals and psychedelia. All colors are intensified, and lights glow much more brightly than normal. Edges are accentuated, and I feel like I'm on 10 hits of acid visually\ldots  but with the presence of mind of most phenethylamines.



T+3:10: I run into my friend biking to the same show I am, and we bike together. We lock our bikes and get to the house, only to find that the show hasn't begun and that our friends (the band, and others) are just hanging out, jamming and talking and drinking. I had originally planned not to drink, since Br-DFly is enough for one night, but someone handed me a beer and from then on I was drinking pretty heavily.



T+5:00: I've been here for a while, socializing and catching up with a lot of people who are in town (it's SXSW week, and spring break). I have had lots of good conversations, and I feel totally comfortable, although some of my perceptions are obviously off (not recognizing people at first, and so on). The visuals are at their peak, I think, and have been for an hour or so. Color intensification and form outlines are the most distinct aspect.



T+7:00: Still drinking and smoking pot and partying with friends at the house show. Br-DFly is a social drug, at least at this level. I feel positive and motivated to talk to people. Body tremor, or what there was of it, seems to have subsided.



T+8:30: We go back to my friend's apartment to drink more, listen to music, smoke pot, and generally hang out. On the way, I fall off my bike, which I attribute to being drunker than I thought - while Br-DFly definitely overpowers alcohol subjectively, my co-ordination was shit, as my body was still drunk. We chill for several hours, and I have great time. The visuals are still going strong. I hang out here until about 3:00, when:



T+10:30: A friend from out of town and I walk back to my place, a couple blocks away. He needs a place to crash and is very drunk. I am as well, but know sleep is impossible. We come home and hang out, smoking pot and talking about music. He eventually realizes I'm going to be awake and active all night, and leaves to sleep at his friend's place 



T+11:00: I inject 50mg more ketamine. I do this every hour and a half for a few of hours, enojying the trip and smoking cigarettes and listening to music. I don't mind being alone at all, and am enjoying the fact that my apartment is very clean (I cleaned it two days prior).



T+16:00: I decide to stop using ketamine, because I'm binging like an addict, and being on Br-DFly isn't an excuse. I lay on my beanbag, wide awake and tripping hard but in a relaxed fashion, listening to music. My friend calls and she says she'll be over later.



T+18:00: It's now 10:00a Wednesday, and my friend comes over for a bit. We smoke a couple of bowls and talk, and I am glad for the company. While tripping alone is fun, conversation is more engaging, and I enjoy it. We smoke cigarettes outside and the sunlight illuminates the world so brightly that I'm blinded by the beauty. The visuals are still going as strong as they were 12 hours ago, and it's already a beautiful sunny day. I feel really positive due to the combination.



T+20:00: I go over to my friend's place, where I was last night, as we had planned today to be a day of relaxation, tripping, and friendship. He and a couple of my other friends take 2C-E (25mg oral, 12 and 12mg snorted). I think that my Br-DFly will wear off soon, so I take two hits of good acid, just to make sure I'm tripping all day. In retrospect, this was probably a complete waste. The Br-DFly didn't change noticeably in character or strength - it was still just `strong' and `unique' and didn't really feel like acid. Anyway, we hang out, listening to music - mostly death metal, as we all love it - and smoking pot. I brought over the very last of my powdered ketamine and shared it freely, since it goes well with everything and today has been decreed a day of self-indulgence.



T+22:00: We decide to rent a couple of movies, and so we get `Moon' and `Paprika'. We decide to watch `Moon', as it had been strongly recommended. We watch it and are absolutely blown away, considering it one of the best movies we've ever seen. It mirrored the surreality that I was experiencing, and did so in an aethetically pleasing fashion. This seems suited to Br-DFly, which is a very aesthetic chemical, based on this experience.



T+24:00: We're still hanging out, occasionally snorting some K (even though this barely does anything to me, given my tolerance), talking, and just generally having a good trip. We re-watch `Moon' to understand it and catch layers we missed the first time. Despite the fact that there are many free shows going on, and that I could easily bike to them, I choose to take it easy. Br-DFly seems like a chemical that is malleable - you can take it easy or do something intense, and it'll pretty much let you without getting in the way.



T+28:00: I go home briefly to meet a friend, smoke some pot, and listen to music. I decide to take a clonazepam 2mg tablet, just to sort of lighten the experience, as it showed no sign of ending and I wanted to sleep tonight. I go back to my friend's with another couple of clonazepam, one for him and the other for me.



T+30:00: We go back to the house where my friend played, as there is more music there. We stay awhile, chat and socialze, and then leave to listen to our friend's radio show. Despite the fact that I've been tripping for what feels like forever, I find socializing easy and fun.



T+33:00: We go back, listen to music, and I get drunk/benzo'd/tired enough to pass the fuck out. My friend walks me home, as he wants something from my place and I am quite out of it, and I go to sleep.



T+48:00: My girlfriend, who I live with and who was out of town the entire time I was on Br-DFly, wakes me up at 4:30pm. I feel tired/fried/exhausted as shit, but alright. I smoke a lot of pot, and go outside, and find myself with visuals as strong as the mid-to-late parts of the trip.



T+48:00-T+72:00+: This whole day and a bit after felt off-basiline. I smoked pot and drank a lot and did a lot (too much) ketamine. I had visuals. I guess this isn't surprising since I did go on a bit of a bender, but luckily didn't fuck myself or anything else up.



I know pot brings back visuals, but I feel like the Br-DFly was still in my system a fair bit - four or five days. These visuals definitely persisted for days, though to be fair I was stoned constantly.
