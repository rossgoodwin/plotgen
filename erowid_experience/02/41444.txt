Background: I love experimenting with drugs, alcohol, anything that can show life to me from a different perspective. One night, I lacked any `real' drugs, and was feeling pretty desperate. I had heard Wellbutrin could be used recreationally, and decided to try it out. At the time I hadn't really read up on it. This was a gamble. 



The Pill Popping Begins:



Around 9 I took a couple Wellbutrin XLs, 300mg per pill. After about 1 1/2 hours, I wasn't feeling anything. I was annoyed, and popped a couple more. Then a few more. 



11ish PM. I had taken around 7-8 ((2100-2400mg)). I was on the phone with my boyfriend. We hung up at 12, and, not feeling anything, I gave up and went to sleep. 



The Trip: 



2AM. I wake up, and get out of bed to go to the bathroom. I fall down. Funny, I can't walk. I realize the pills must be kicking in. 



I'm not *quite* clear on what I did all night. At around 3:45 I know I was reading rolling stone, and my mom got up. I started rambling about hate crimes against transsexuals to her. Hallucinations started sometime around then.



I went back to my room. At this point, walking was slightly difficult. I recall deciding that every day I would have a `word of the day' so I went and got a dictionary. I printed out the word and definition for quixotic on a notecard. My hand shook and I could barely write. I would keep thinking people were in my room; I checked my closet and would whirl around to check shadows. I was scared out of my mind. This continued the whole night, puncuated by me attempting to sleep with no success. 



At 6ish, I took a shower. When I got out, wrapped in a towel, I was so sure people were watching me that I pulled on clothes while hiding in the towel still. After dressing, I started feeling nauseous. I threw up 3 times. I couldn't eat, couldn't even drink water without feeling so sick. 



At school I had the next 4 hours to sit and take standardized tests. Hell. I was still hallucinating. I had horrible dry mouth and nausea. I kept seeing a mouse under my teachers desk. Thank God I managed to supress the urge to yell `Dude, there's a mouse under your desk' to my teacher. 



I left at 12, too tired, sick, and scared to care about the next 2 classes. 



I couldn't sleep that day, had a doctors appointment, felt like crap, and couldn't put a bite of food in my mouth till dinnertime. 



All in all, a horrible experience. I later found out the dose I took was incredible but somehow I made it out alive. Hallucinations were terrifying. The experience was horrible, but taught me not to be so foolish with medication.
