First a little background on me: 



I'm 21 years old, and I've spent the last 6 years as a pretty regular marijuana smoker. I smoke just about every day. I work as a graphic designer, and a joint in the late afternoon is priceless for recharging my creative juice!



Up until this year I had never tried any other recreational drug beyond pot. While I consider myself a risk-taker and adventurous, I'm protective of my mind. I have a very non-addictive personality and it's easy for me to turn down a session or a drink when I'm busy or not in the mood. It was a combination of this fact, and moving into my own apartment that has given me the confidence to experiment with other drugs. In the last 5 months I've shroomed, dropped acid, and taken Vicodin. They were all great experiences, and Vicadin has become something my buddies and I enjoy taking occasionally before smoking weed. 



Now to my experience with Oxycontin:



A relative of mine was given a prescription for Oxycontin in 20 mg pills following surgery. My positive reactions to Vicodin made me curious to try Oxycontin just once. Still, I debated it with myself for almost a month before finally tucking three of the tiny pink pills into my pocket while last visiting my family.



I think it is extremely important to research any drug you are curious to try, and so I gathered as much dosage and reactionary info as I could on oxycontin. I read plenty of negative and cautionary information, but felt that since the prescription was non-refillable, this would be my only opportunity to obtain the powerful opioid. I think if I had a permanent connection to the drug, I probably never would have tried it. 



I knew I had the choice to either snort it, inject it, or chew it. Swallowing a whole pill does not deliver the drug quickly enough through your system. The thought of snorting it crossed my mind for a second, but I decided that it would feel too much like I was doing cocaine, and that's a line I will never venture across. Oxycontin will be the furthest I ever climb up the opiate tree.



So at about noon on a beautiful Sunday - back in the comfort of my apartment - I turned on a movie, set the three pills on a ceramic plate, and crushed them into a fine powder. I took a drink of water to wet my mouth, and then licked the powder off the plate. I know it sounds like a bit of a strange way to ingest a drug, but I had a bad experience as a kid when I stupidly chewed a Tylonol. Licking the plate tasted just as bad, but i didn't have to deal with picking chunks of dissolving Oxycontin out from between my teeth. It was actually a very easy way to take the drug, and I certainly recommend it over chewing. I drank the rest of the water and sat back to watch tv.



Within twenty minutes I was feeling different. It was similar to the onset of Vicodin, and that fact definitely eased my mind. My body felt loose and heavy, and I started losing concentration on the movie. After ten more minutes I got up to refill my water. I knew right away that I was walking funny. It felt as though my mind had turned over control of walking to my legs, and the rest of my body was following them. I grabbed some water, and by the time I reached the couch again, my head was spinning. It wasn't a bad spinning, but it was a very unique feeling. I'd opened the windows earlier to get some fresh air into the stuffy apartment, and I was suddenly very cold. I grabbed a blanket, and curled up to watch the movie.



My body felt very heavy like most painkiller/muscle relaxers will do, but there was an added sensitivity to touch. This was first evident when I reached down to scratch my thigh. I chill ran up my spine as soon my fingertips touched my leg. It wasn't a sexual or introspective moment, just more of an general excitement or surprise.



Then the itching started. First it was my balls. I thought I just needed to shower. (Haha!) Then it moved up my body to my stomach. Strangely, I welcomed each place that needed to be itched, and thought of it almost like a game. The combination of itching, and the resulting goosebumps and chills when I would itch was a great, euphoric feeling. I must've spent almost 45 minutes just laying there staring blankly at the t.v. and itching my stomach, arms, legs and back. 



There were two phone calls, and I had to focus pretty strongly on talking intelligently. But it wasn't a drunk-sort-of stupidity, nor stupidity at all. I think my speech may have been a little slurred at worst, and I had trouble maintaining a consistent attitude. It was as though my reactions were turned up a notch. My buddy said something that normally would've mildly annoyed me. Instead I went off on him for a minute, and when I realized what I was doing, I apologized and that turned into me feeling really terrible. I knew I had to get off the phone.



After this, I started to get a mild nauseous feeling. It came on first as I went to sit back down after taking a leak in the bathroom. I sat there for maybe a minute, nauseated and on the brink of vomiting. But I didn't. And I knew I wasn't going to. But all the sensations were there. 



All of these feelings of euphoria, intense relaxation, difficulty concentrating, and itching continued for nearly two hours. The nausea came on and off, and looking back I think it was because I'd eaten almost nothing the entire morning. I tried at one point to sit at the computer and talk to a college friend online, but it was difficult and annoying and in less than 2 minutes I signed off without saying goodbye.



At about 2 PM I laid back down on the couch. It was then that I realized I was sweating. I'd gone from being relatively cold to needing to undress i was so warm. I stripped down to boxers and sat lazily on the couch trying to figure out the point of the movie. I was enjoying the `high' very much, but also confused at the wide gamut of sensations. I was euphoric and relaxed, but also nauseated and itchy; once cold, then suddenly hot.



Around 3 PM I dozed off for a little bit, and I was almost completely aware of the moment I went from being awake to sleeping. It was an interesting sensation.



It is now almost 5 hours later, and it felt like 10 minutes ago it was noon. I'm still in an altered state, though I'm much closer to sober than not. I'm at the point I need to take a nap, and I'm contemplating whether or not I enjoyed the experience.



I have no problem never taking Oxycontin again, because the feelings I had during my trip were just amplified and mutated sensations I get from taking Vicodin, but Oxycontin is several times more dangerous. Maybe snorting or injecting Oxycontin, or taking it in a larger dose, would change these sensations, but I'm just fine with the method and amount of the drug I took.



Oxycontin is an extremely volatile opiate, and highly addictive when abused. If you have access to the drug, please start with only a small dose. I'm a regular guy, just slightly above-average sized: in very good shape and 6-foot tall. 60 milligrams was a pretty good amount for me, and I don't believe that taking more would have made it more enjoyable, just stronger. If you've never taken pharms before, especially a strong painkiller, be careful. 



If you trust yourself to be mature and careful, Oxycontin can be a unique experience. If not, at least you will have found places to itch you never even knew existed!
