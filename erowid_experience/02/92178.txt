My previous experience with psychedelics includes lots of cannabis, a few low and very high dose mushroom trips, several Salvia trips, LSD once, 10mg trip on 2-cb and one ecstasy buzz.



Cactus - San Pedro 

Dose - 2 feet and about 10cm in diameter $\sim$ 500-600mg?

Preparation - Whole cactus sliced then boiled and blended into a soup then boiled down to about 800mls



I slept until about 11am then had a shower and grabbed all my supplies for the day (3L of water and some food). I had been fasting since the night before so I grabbed some food to eat after ingestion. I had also had some travel sickness pills the night before and in the morning.



My plan was to ingest my horrid cactus juice then go back to my mate's place after he finished his exam. So at about 12 I started drinking my juice in a large local park, the taste was horridly bitter and foul but I chased it down with limes and orange juice which made it just bearable. This took about 45 minutes to do.



At about 1 I was feeling very nauseous and felt like I was going to vomit so I decided to smoke some weed to soothe my stomach (which turned out to be a great idea). I then proceeded to lay down in an attempt to calm my stomach.



About 20 minutes passed and I was feeling slightly different, I thought this was just the cannabis because cactus is supposed to take a long time to come up. My thoughts were wrong, at about 2 I decided to go for a walk and when I got up I realized that this is the mescaline kicking in. The concrete had Aztec patterns and temples dancing and my whole surrounding felt much more vibrant and impacting. Walking was difficult as I wanted to sit down and rest so I did along my way to my mate's school.



At about 3 I had reached my destination (took me 1 hour to walk 500 meters). I waited near the gate for his school to be let out. I texted him and told him where I was but I got no reply so I called him all I got was voicemail, I decided to just wait it out and stayed at his school until about 3.30 all the time trying to get a hold of him with no luck.



I was hungry so I walked about 3 km to a supermarket where I bought a pie and some bread. I then went to a large park with a pond and native bush (I am in New Zealand so that means like ferns and shrubs). Once here I started to really feel my self trip hard; the concrete was forming patterns which were amazing and complex (I found it very empowering to think that my mind was creating everything I saw in front of me). 

I then looked up at the clouds and they were also forming shapes and tessellating like crazy. I felt like I was in control of the clouds and I was making them join and split with such precision and finesse it was hard to believe.



At about 5 I decided that I would just go and make a camp in the bush (about 10 km away) instead of just turning up at my mates place. So I walked up some steep hills and grabbed some dry firewood on the way. The walk there was very strange, I had memories of being a child and a strange recollection of the events currently happening. I felt strong in my mind and body like I was going to provide for my self like some kind of caveman (sounds strange I know). I kept my confidence up by thinking about how I was going to provide for myself and make a fire.



I reached my destination at about 8 and it was nearly pitch black, I walked down the track which lead through the bush and found a nice spot about 500 meters away from the trail to avoid suspicion. I set up a camp by getting some ferns and creating a small wind shelter (It was in winter). I began trying to start a fire but found it difficult because it was wet and was having difficulty concentrating. Once I had got a fire going I started to relax and warm up, I stared at the fire and saw Aztecs again but this time dancing around inside the flames (Very cool to look at) they were calming me down and it felt like I was not alone but instead was surrounded by a great inner and outer warmth, I felt at one with the earth around me.



At about 9 I decided to cook some bread (toast?). This warmed me up and made me feel that maybe not finding my friend was actually a good thing because here I was roughing it in the bush under my own power. Strangely I wasn't scared of anything at this point, even thought I was in a pitch black bush on the outskirts of the city running out of dry firewood, I wasn't afraid of this because of all the self encouragement I had given myself earlier. 



At 10 I tried to sleep but was too cold and was still too buzzed from the cactus to calm my mind down to a sleep state. I tried meditating but was too cold to hold on to any calmness. At this point I needed to move to try and warm up as I had run out of dry firewood and all the bush around me was too green and wet. So I ran to try and stay alive (it was about 5*C and I only had 2 layers on). I was slightly scared at this point because up to here the cactus had given me confidence and courage but as my temperature dropped my mind was in a fury thinking about how I would have to fight to stay alive. I was having difficulty focusing on what I should and I knew if I didn't do something fast I would slip into a bad trip. 



At 11 I was still at serious risk of hypothermia but had a smart idea to stuff ferns down my shirt and start running to build up body temperature, I am unsure if it was the mescaline or survival instinct that gave me this idea but either way this really warmed me up and swayed my mind away from a bad trip.



At 12 I was warm and still seeing pretty intense closed and open eye visuals mostly of a kaleidoscopic/Aztec style. I began the long walk back to my house as I decided I would not be able to sleep in the bush with a lack of proper clothing and dry firewood. During the 15 km walk home I did not feel tired or sore at all and every footstep still felt vibrant and soft. Street lights would leave trails and cars passing by would have trails like a long exposure film, I was amazed that I was still feeling such effects 12-14 hours on.



I got home at about 4am but was still far off baseline. I layed in bed and stared at my ceiling for a good hour observing the Aztec dancing which has followed me the duration of my trip (almost like a trip guide).



The day after I woke at 12 and still had a body buzz with my mind feeling like it was in a dream state, my feet and legs were sore from the 30 km trek the night before but I knew it was all worth it.



From this experience I think I have gained some serious self confidence I now know that I am a strong person both mentally and physically and this in turn has improved even my love life, I had the confidence to chat to a chick who I thought was way out of my league before my trip and I turns out she had a thing for me the whole time. I would defiantly do mescaline again and am planning on doing an extraction in the coming weeks. To any people thinking of doing mescaline I would say to go for it but if possible do an extraction because of the taste.
