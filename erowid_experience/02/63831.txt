First of all I have been experimenting with many substances this summer and when one of my friends told me about painkillers it sounded interesting to I wanted to try it. I had some hydrocodone and instantly fell in love with the immense Chill feeling that painkillers gave me. One day I had some friends over and my parents weren't home. 



We really wanted some painkillers but non of us had any so I was looking thru my medicine cabinet to find something I could get a buzz off of because both of my parents have had major surgeries in the past, researching every name I found on a prescription bottle online. I got nothing so far after lookin thru for about 20 minutes until I came across one of those sample packs labeled Ultram. I searched it online and planned on taking it. My friends didn't want to take it so I was the guinea pig. I took them and I fell in love with it. Since then I've been trying so hard to get more. 



Finally I hit my personal gold mine-180 Tramadol tablets all to myself. I decided to take a few the day I got them.



T+0:00 -- I am at my friends house just chillin and I decide to ingest 4 50mg tablets of Tramadol with a little food to pad my stomach.



T+0:15 -- I go outside with my friend to have a cigarette with my friend. He had some Tramadol 2 hours earlier and is already chill as fuck. We enjoy our cigs and talk about life and stuff like we usually do only he was so mellow.



T+0:30 -- I have to leave my friend's house to go home, I still have not felt any significant effect.



T+1:00 -- I begin to feel a moderate Hydrocodone feeling. I'm very excited because I have done this before and I know what's coming is awesome. Nothing is bothering me except for very slight nausea, but it may just be there because I'm thinking about it or I'm moving too much.



T+1:30 -- The feeling is slowly getting stronger and I just got hit with the itches.



T+2:40 -- The feeling is very strong now. I am not nauseous at all and I feel so happy. I'm walking around the house looking for something to do and just smiling and the setting of my house just seems so perfect. I am not hungry. I feel like taking a shower because I've herd it feels good when one is on Tramadol.



T+3:05 -- The shower was utterly amazing! As soon as I stepped in I was flushed with an immense Euphoria as the water runs down my body and thru my hair. I am so incredibly happy and decide to take another 50mg tablet of Tramadol.



T+4:05 -- I decide to get on the computer after watching T.V. for what seemed like wonderful hours and hours but was only one hour. I started talking to people on AIM and Listening to some Music and it is so much fun, I feel like talking so much and I'm getting into the music. I love these people that I'm talking to and I let them know that, I feel like loving everyone and letting them know that. I'm so happy and I can't keep a smile off my face I'm enjoying myself so much.



T+5:15 -- This is the strongest I've felt! I am so indescribably happy!! At this point I am more chill than I have ever been in my life. I literally can not stop smiling as I continue talking to people and listening to music. Everything is so enjoyable I never want to stop feeling this way. Listening to the music is so euphoric and I'm getting so into it because it feels so good I feel like the music is a part of me.



T+5:40 -- I have started to feel kind of tired, I decide to get off the computer and watch more tv. It's a relief and it feels so good to lay down on my couch and just relax as I sink into the soft cushions and enjoy some late night television.



T+7:00 -- It is now midnight and I stop watching tv because I feel completely exhausted, yet I still feel incredibly happy and wonderful. I feel like I will sleep well tonight. I am out almost as soon as I hit the pillow.



The Day After -- I still feel pretty good, I'm tired but I still feel energetic. I think I'm just tired because my fucking dog woke me up at 6:30 barking at squirrels (damn dog). I feel sort of a pressure headache, but it's not enough to even bother me I can just forget about it. I also notice I am a little bit irritable but since I was expecting to be I can control my anger and just relax. I am still not as irritable as I would be off hydrocodone. Other than that I don't really feel any kind of hangover but I still feel like just relaxing. I LOVE THIS DRUG!
