I'd like to relate my first experience with Ayahuasca. I had read a lot about it online and as I am fascinated with hallucinogens and native cultures of the Americas I was determined to try it\ldots I found recipes online and some suppliers to and after some time I had more than enough to concoct the basic recipes.



I decided I would boil some Syrian Rue to take 20-30 minutes before the first of the Aya brew. The Syrian Rue acts as an MAO inhibitor which is necessary to allow the DMT present in the brew to get into the bloodstream. Not to get ahead of myself here but that \emph{Banisteriopsis} in the ayahuasca acts as a MAOI too. I just wanted my MAO's in my stomach to be inhibited already by the time the Aya got there. Anyway\ldots I measured out 3.2 grams. I was shooting for 3g but I overpoured a little, that's why 3.2g. I put it into my blender with the least possible amount of water. Mid setting turned out not to be expected so I set the speed to the highest and it did a good job of opening up the seeds. I put them to boil in an enameled saucepan with $<$ 1g of citric acid to aid in the extraction of the alkaloids. I boiled this for about an hour while I was preparing the Aya, then filtered the seed parts out through a 35Î¼ filter bag which I had already from doing other projects. I reduced the liquid to about half a cup, enough to drink in maybe 2 large gulps.



As far as the ayahuasca, I decided to go with 1g of 50x \emph{Banisteriopsis caapi} extract, that represented the alkaloid content of 50 grams of \emph{caapi}, which seemed to me to be an average, middle of the road amount of \emph{caapi} for a single dose of Aya. Next I added 6g of \emph{Mimosa hostilis} rootbark in finely powdered form. After that I added 6g of \emph{Diplopterys cabrerana} leaves. These I did put in the blender with a small amount of water, the other ingredients were powdered already so they went right in the pot.



I added a gram of pure citric acid since it's been my understanding that acidic water gets the alkaloids out easier. I put these ingredients all together into a different saucepan than what I was using to make the Rue (\emph{Peganum harmala}), since I was going to take the rue some time before starting with the actual Aya. I tried to find out what size pan I used in quarts but it's not marked. It was kind of small, smaller in diameter than a baseball cap and around 6 inches deep or left. I didn't want to use too much water because I would be reducing it later anyway. I filled the pan about halfway up and put it on medium boil for about half an hour, at which time I filtered the plant matter out and transferred the water into a third saucepan, the biggest of the three. I got this started reducing while I put the plant matter into some new water and started it boiling for the second time. It's going to take a long time to do all this so if you can have the final reduction begin as soon as possible, you can shave a little time off the process. 



Half an hour later, I repeated the filtering, added the boiled water to the water in the reducing pan, and set the plant matter to boiling for its third and final run.



Half an hour later I filtered the water, added it to the other finished water in the reducing pan, and buried the depleted plant matter under a tree in my backyard so that its nutrients could be absorbed by another plant and thus find new life.



After some time the water was reducing to a thick reddish brown broth. I let it get low in the pan\ldots my idea was to make a two stage dose as close to one gulp in a dose as possible because I had heard it tasted nasty and that I could expect to vomit at some point during the Aya journey. I divided the dose into two glasses and set them aside.



I took the cup I had already put the rue water into and drank it.  It tasted kind of familiar, not very good tasting at all though, plus it was acidic from the citric acid I had added.



I set the timer on the stove for twenty minutes and did something else for a while. The timer sounded, and I turned it off and then downed the first dose of the ayahuasca.



Aarrgh it was nasty! There are a lot of different ways you can make it, with different ingredients and so forth and this was my first time. I had put citric acid in it and reduced it in volume, thereby concentrating all the solids and nonvolatile liquids in it\ldots for all the world it tasted like stomach acid/bile\ldots definitely a lot of that was a result of the added acid. Next time I will go by litmus strips instead of just throwing it in haphazardly. But I did get it down and didn't vomit then.



Time went by. I was waiting for the onset or the signs that something was starting to happen. An hour had gone by, and nothing. I was a little upset because I had read on one particular website devoted to ayahuasca that a beginner shouldn't even dare to take more than 3g \emph{M. hostilis} for the helper plant in the aya, otherwise he might find himself tormented by horrifying, permanently mind-warping visions. I have seen a lot of different recipes\ldots from what I took from that knowledge, 10g of Mimosa plus the equivalent of 50-60g caapi would yield a medium-or-better experience. That's how I decided to go with the amounts of helper plants that I did. I had planned on adding 5g of each Mimosa and Diplopterys, but when I was measuring out the Diplopterys for the blender I poured out 6g's, so I measured 6g's of Mimosa as well just because I'm like that. I had just had at least two very frightening trips on 5x Salvia very recently, and after that I felt like anything else would be a cake walk. I thought, `if this shit tries to freak me out, I'll just grab its ears, jump on its back and ride the son-of-a-bitch to the next town.'



Nothing was happening. I decided to go take a bath to relax, I was getting a little tense because I felt like I had either gotten misidentified or poorly handled and stored material or just as likely, bad info from the internet (always a possibility).



As the tub filled I decided to take the other half of the dose. UUrrghrhlll Nasty!!  I drank it down as quick as I could, very manly. Got into the warm water and lay back. I was pretty thirsty but these internetters make so much of `the purge' that I was convinced I would eventually vomit, and I feared that if I did drink some water it would only provoke my stomach and that would be it.



I stayed in there a while. I was reading a magazine when I realized that my chest had that `amped' charged feeling\ldots my thighs too, and I was encouraged.



After ten or fifteen minutes more, I found that my whole body was infused with the same energy and the room looked a little bit different too. Like the walls were higher! I noticed the sounds from inside and outside the house. I could see how, if I were an Amazonian tribesman, and I had drunk some Aya, I would have the advantage of hearing every twig snapping, every rustling in the leaves, even the breathing of the quarry.

 

I closed my eyes and discovered the most beautiful closed-eye-visuals. Symmetrical arabesques, all shifting rainbow colors. Another pattern was similar to the pebbled texture of a basketball, but flat, across my entire field of view, and rainbow colored, the colors shifting and morphing.



I drained the water and stood to shower off. We have a pulsating shower-massage type shower head, and when it started up it sounded just like a rattlesnake. I wasn't startled and didn't recoil from the sound, I just thought wow, how is it that I didn't notice that before?



I got out and dried. I really was reluctant to put my clothes on. I thought to myself, `now I know why those tribesmen go around mostly naked. Clothes are cumbersome and uncomfortable.' But I put them on anyway and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Things were looking much different than during normal awareness. I can't describe it--like a mushroom trip. No wild melting things or things flying around at the edge of your vision, but just a very different perspective. The house looked filthy\ldots it's just cluttered really and could use a vacuum. But still, I guess if the ayahuasca taught me something on my first trip it was that the house needs to be respected, by means of cleaning her, and I saw how it looks to other people.



It was night and I was reluctant to do anything or go outside the house, as I wasn't sure if I would break whatever I was working on or mess up whatever I was doing so I started to watch television.



I was watching documentaries and some really interesting things were on. Presently I started to get that bubbling, spasming feeling in my chest and the laugh attacks began. All kinds of laughs\ldots giggling, the silent rhythmic pre-laugh, even a couple of Eddie-Murphies. This went on for at least an hour. I was managing to suppress most of them but then I just had to let it out. It feels so good to laugh, doesn't it?



I was peaking then. I had taken the first of the Aya at 7:00pm. It was about 10 when I believe I peaked. CEV's were no more intense than when I first noticed them. However, I experimented a little with eyes closed and found that I could actually change the visuals merely thinking about it: I could will them to change with my thoughts, and what's more I felt like I knew this, and that it was a given. For example, I was presented with some interlocking U/fishbone type shapes just like on those old timey psychedelic wall posters from the seventies (incidentally, when I saw that I though Ohhhhh\ldots .now I totally get it.. lol). Then I remembered on of the first pattern visuals I had, from LSD when I was a kid of 15 or so: a million tiny cogs, like the gears inside a wristwatch, wall-to-wall across my field of vision--all meshed and turning together in unison. I willed myself to see it, and there they were, rendered in the same rainbow hue. I willed up more images, they seemed foreign to my imagination. I mean, portrayed as someone else besides me would have done it, not the way I would have rendered them\ldots ? Something like that. Next time I think I am going to experiment with some remote viewing, astral projection or divination. This time was kind of a beginning type verification of recipes, first introduction, testing the waters kind of experience. I believe that plant based hallucinogens open up parts of the mind normally blocked off in everyday life, and native cultures around the world use them for finding lost objects, discovering the cause of illness, or misfortunes, to divine the future etc. This is fascinating to me.  



By 12:00 that night I was coming back to baseline.  Still had that amped feeling and a slightly altered perspective, but it was clear that I was pretty much through.  I ate a meal since I realized I was hungry and drank plenty of water.



You might have noticed that I didn't mention having vomited. Well, I didn't. After drinking the Aya I felt fairly certain that something that acidic and hmmmm\ldots . I don't know how to describe the other element\ldots not foul, fetid nor putrid because it is none of those things. Unpalatable? That's very general but I can't think of any better descriptor right now. Not bitter. Anyway, the way my ayahuasca tasted, I was fairly sure it would come up again, and like I said, the aya websites say it's going to happen and there's no avoiding it\ldots Well, I didn't puke. I would have said so, it's nothing to be ashamed of, you have to expect it. Just like I suppose if you were going to chew Peyote you would expect to vomit, from practically every experience I have read about or heard in a conversation, that's just part of it and they go hand in hand.



For what it's worth, my plant materials were mail ordered and not fresh, who knows how old or new they might be, or if different drying/curing processes the strength of the alkaloids. It's just my first time experimenting with this substance. Who knows, maybe in someone else's hands, the recipe I made up will cause terrifying visions or a terrifying trip. \emph{Mimosa} and \emph{Diplopterys} are supposed to be more powerful than the \emph{Psychotria} that is most traditionally used in aya. And a lot has to do with the efficacy of the MAO inhibitor plant that paves the way for the helper plants to do their visionary thing.



All in all, to describe the effect in a way that more people will be able to relate to, I would say that this experience reminded me very much of frying on 100 Î¼g (micrograms) of LSD: a threshold dose causing CEVs, open eye perspective shifts and contour variations, body amp feeling and laugh attacks. Also fascination with things or subjects that would normally be taken for granted. Also heightened sense of nonverbal communications with pet animals (dogs) -- I felt as though I could read their intent and emotions even more clearly than usual.



Psilocybin mushrooms have also shown me a similar trip. I can't give a dosage here, I am a little ignorant on that\ldots the dose I usually get is `here ya go,' but yeah I would say the trip I had was very similar to 100 mikes of decent LSD.



Disclaimer/word to the wise: One thing I agree with from the Aya forums is that it's better to go modest and then if you get a disappointingly weak experience, ramp it up a little at a time. Just because I say this 6/6g recipe yielded a trip I equate with one hit of acid, don't increase it to 30/30g in hopes of getting a 500Î¼g equivalent experience. You could wind up in the hospital, in jail or worse\ldots  Like I have repeated several times, this is just my first time. Maybe I made a mistake that weakened my brew. Maybe my \emph{Mimosa} sat out in the sun for too long.  Maybe my \emph{Diplopterys} contains no DMT (active ingredient found also in \emph{Mimosa}, \emph{Psychotria} and many other plants that are not closely associated with Aya).



I plan to do it again relatively soon. I found it enjoyable. It seems like it has features that could be explored a lot further, things I wasn't expected. I definitely want to try some remote viewing next time. It was so effortless to call up patterns and images, I think there is probably some application for that.'



I would like to thank Crow Man for helping me prepare the brews, for watching over me during the trip (and not leaving when I stayed in the bathroom for an hour!) and thanks in advance for entering this statement into Erowid's experience vault for me -- what a task.



Now that we know the nature of the trip I think that you could join me next time, I am certain that you would enjoy it, and I don't think we'd need a sitter for this kind of a journey.'
