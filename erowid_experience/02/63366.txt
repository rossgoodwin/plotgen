When I woke up at around 10:30 a.m. on the day of my birthday, two of my friends (let's call them ``M'', who is my roommate, and ``K'') were standing over me pointing at my desk. When I looked over, I saw that there were three shot glasses on the table, each filled almost to the top with a clear, watery substance. Each shot glass contained 20 mg of 2C-E diluted in water. All three of us are hardcore potheads and had experimented extensively with psychedelic drugs such as mushrooms and LSD, but it would be the first time either of us had done 2C-E. Without much thought, we drank the stuff as a toast to my birthday.



Our plan for the day was to go hiking through the woods that the college we attend is surrounded by. As we started walking into the woods, I could not tell whether the 2C-E was kicking in or I was just feeling the usual grogginess I feel after waking up. After wandering through the woods for about an hour, it became apparent that I had officially departed from reality. Walking down a straight path leading through the forest, I could see myself through the whole long continuum of the path, as if watching myself walking from behind, seeing not just what was in front of me, but also myself as well as the road behind me. It was the kind of perspective shift that I was used to with acid, but with 2C-E, this was just the beginning. At this point, the hallucinations had not begun yet. I only noticed that if I ever stopped walking and stood in one spot on the path, all the treetops in front of me would begin to mesh together in a moving kaleidoscope of foliage. If I started walking again, this would go away.



Coming across a narrow riverbed, we decided to hop it, especially since it was winter and most of the river was iced over. However, ``K'', stepping on the ice, immediately sank through, stepping into the icy river in below freezing temperature. His foot began to go numb, and not being sure whether it was from the 2C-E or the icy water, we decided to head back to our dormitory. By this point, we were at least 2 or 3 hours into the trip and substantially wasted. I did not realize exactly how hard I was tripping until I got inside and back into my room.



As soon as we got back to our rooms, M lay down in his bed and stayed there for probably about 45 minutes, saying that everything was too intense. I went into K's room instead to listen to some music and relax. As soon as the music turned on, the whole room started dancing. This is when I realized just how different and intense this drug is. Everywhere I looked, I saw popping visuals dancing towards me, like rays of rainbow-colored light was radiating from my eyes, coloring the whole room in a transparent reflective shining mist of color, sprouting flowers that pulsated to the music. The visuals were not coming from something moving or changing shape in the outside world, but instead, it was as if there were kaleidoscopic lenses pulled over my eyes that distorted absolutely everything I was looking at.



At this point, one of my other friends, ``A'', who had tried 2C-E just the night before and had not had the chance to tell me his experiences yet, came to hang out with us. Seeing that we were extensively under the influence, he informed ``K'' and me that 2C-E seems to have no endpoint and basically drives you insane. This is not a good thing to hear when you have already taken the substance and can do nothing to reverse that decision.  Nevertheless, at that point I was having such a great time watching the whole room dance that I did not care much if it never wore off.



I glanced out the window at the snow-covered field outside and immediately became mesmerized by the Dali-like landscape I saw outside, somewhat 2-dimensional but extremely gorgeous, the bare trees sprouting what looked like toucan beaks (I know it sounds stupid but it looked really cool). I continued to trip out in K's room for a while, perfectly content where I was and not really able to work up the energy to go anywhere else. This covers about the first 6 or 7 hours of the trip.



This is where the mood of the trip changed. Maybe it is just because I am so used to acid, which subsides after about 6 to 8 hours, but the length of this 2C-E trip really unnerved me. It was not so much that I thought that I would never be sane again, but more that I started to feel restless for the trip to end. By about 9 hours in, I was no longer having any visuals but had the clear sense that I was still FUCKED UP. I felt burnt-out the way I usually feel after I come down from acid, but at the same time I had to acknowledge to myself that I was still tripping very hard. ``M'' turned off the lights in our room and switched on the black lights. We spent I don't know how many hours covering everything from our bodies to the walls with highlighter, just because there was nothing else to do and all the highlighter looked very trippy in the black lights. By this time, it was dark and cold outside, so we were cooped up in one room for maybe 4 or 5 hours just waiting for the trip to end. At one point, we joined some of our non-tripping friends, who were watching ``The Thin Red Line'' (need I mention a little intense for a psychedelic experience). We watched the movie with them, though I remember thinking that the movie I was watching might have been substantially different from the one that was actually on television. Instead of actual dialogue, the movie seemed to be filled with clichés of lines I've heard in terrible action movies. Unfortunately, I have not since seen the movie while not on psychedelic drugs, so I don't actually know how far from reality I was at that point.



The weird thing about watching a movie filled with so much violence and pain while tripping was that I had to purposefully try not to get too into it, lest I start experiencing some of the same emotions that the dying soldiers on screen were feeling. I forced myself to be detached from what was going on in the movie, which resulted in me being much less comfortable ever since with watching such movies. It is easy to watch a superhero mow down hundreds of thugs that have no backstory to them, and therefore no relation to the person watching. I realized that this is why we are all so infatuated with violence on television or in movies. It is because none of us ever put ourselves in the place of the person who is being shot, tortured, or abused. Since this 2C-E trip, I almost involuntarily put myself in the shoes of those getting slaughtered in the bloody movies that others find so appealing. Putting myself in the shoes of those inconsequential characters whose purpose in a movie is solely to get killed automatically repulses me from watching any type of movie like that.



Even though I took the drug at between 10:30 and 11 in the morning, I did not start coming down until somewhere between 8 or 9 p.m. By this I mean that the hours between 11 a.m. and 9 p.m. felt like what I imagine 5 hits of acid would feel like when mixed with a triple stack of E. After 9, coming down still felt akin to 1 or 2 tabs, and I was only able to go to sleep at around 7 in the morning, after spending hours in bed just listening to music, trying to fall asleep and still tripping.



Overall impressions: 2C-E is certainly the most visual psychedelic I have ever taken. This was most noticeable whenever I was in a stationary position, and especially when music is playing. This seems to upgrade the hallucinations into a completely absurd realm. However, at the same time, 2C-E allows me to be more in control of myself. It is easier to carry on a conversation with someone else. I preserved a sense of self, of identity, much more than with acid, where I feel more like a cog in the vast totality of the machine that is my environment. It seems to me hard to imagine for this drug to cause a bad trip, more of a possibility to have one that is way too intense due to taking too much. I would recommend this substance only to people who have had a lot (I mean A LOT) of experience with other psychedelics. And make sure you have nothing to do for several days, since the trip takes up all day and the next day my brain felt like it was being squeezed from all sides, making it hard to accomplish anything productive. However, the peak of 2C-E (from 1 hour in to about 8) was one of the most intense, but amazing experiences I have ever had.
