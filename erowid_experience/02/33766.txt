I have been interested in psychoactive substances for a number of months after having a strange dream about LSD.  I smoked weed in high school and usually enjoyed being alone in the woods more than anything, now that I am middle aged I think I have a much more balanced view on how and what these chemicals can do. I must also mention that I am a Christian and have found that for some people, various natural and synthetic substances can aid in our understanding of the spiritual realm, which the Bible so clearly describes. Although it is not the norm, in some cases I think God gives a pass during phases or times in life of deeper thinking. Prayer, Meditation, Solitude and Fasting are more pure ways of gaining understanding of who we are and the essence of the universe. I believe psychotropic substances can be a stepping stone or a halfway point for average people to understand we are more than physical beings and there are a vast array of spiritual dimensions and entities some benevolent and some not. Well just the same here is one of my experiences.



I wanted to try most every mind altering drug there is and I have tried a few as of late, 2 weeks ago I decided to try Morning Glory seeds. They are legal to obtain and LSD somewhat intrigued me.  I bought 6 or 7 packs from the store and got them home and washed them with soapy water and then ground them up in the coffee grinder, about 270 seeds, as I have read this is a medium to large dose for my weight. I soaked them in about 1.5 cups of water and let the groul ferment for a couple of hours. I happened to be about 1/2 hour from my house so I stopped at a gas station and got some soda as a chaser. As I sat in my truck I gulped the whole thing down. It did not taste too repulsive but the groul was a bit slimy at some points.

Halfway to my house I started to feel very edgy and sweaty and nauseas I was having a difficult time commanding my vehicle into the neighborhood, and was hoping to get inside before I heaved or the neighbors noticed I was staggering going into the house.



Once inside the house I tried to get a grip on things, put away my stuff and took off my shoes etc., even yet I was shaky and sweaty in my hands and uneasy. It was almost like when I have a fever and I am delirious, but not as sick as that. I decided to take a shower and settle down, as the water was warming up I felt pretty sick so I headed to the toilet and heaved a couple of times. I felt a little better and took a shower dealing with the physical changes that were going on.



It also seemed my heart rate was up and I did not feel all that great, although I did sense that my thinking was a bit heightened. I lay on the couch listening to some beautiful worship music and that was some real comfort. My sister called me and we talked for a bit and my good friend as I told him what was going on. Again I want to stress that at this point and throughout the experience it was not a fun time. Very uneasy, physically rattled, sweating and laying down on my back was the most comfortable thing to do.



At about the 3 hour mark I decided to spark up some MJ, as I had a small stash and I had heard this helps the sickness. I did a few hits and tried to mellow out. What began to happen after the MJ was the usual deeper thinking from weed, but almost without the body sluggishness and clumsiness that comes from MJ.  My sickness subsided for the most part and it seemed I had a super clear buzz going on, very intense. Although I have never done LSD I can relate when people say they were `frying on acid' as it seemed my mind was racing fairly fast. I began to have deeper spiritual thoughts and I was much more able to see that this world is indeed under the sway of the evil one and it is almost like the entire world is being constricted by a roiling serpent. People are locked into their homes in fear and suspicion of their fellow man and the governmental structure is highly influenced by powerful spiritual entities who seek to enslave and destroy mankind.  These truths were understood and `felt' on a much deeper level than normal, and much more so than doing MJ on it's own.



I was also more acutely aware that most people spend their lives in a very shallow existence, not wanting to acknowledge what is really going on in this world, why we are here and what is the reason for it all.  Spirit is spirit and I do not want to live my live on a 2 dimensional plane getting by with smiles and formalities. 



I went to bed about 11 o'clock that night and I did NOT sleep a wink I don't believe. What a bad feeling to be dog tired and not able to sleep, I have read this as a common trait of LSD, but I had never felt this until doing these seeds. It was a rough night trying to get some shut eye, and I was thinking about a lot of things. I did not have any visuals or other hallucinatory effects except I was able to visualize images more clearly when I was seeing the serpent coiled around this world and Jesus as the coming conqueror to destroy the `god of this world', it was very strong and clear. I had a good time of personal prayer as I once again had to lay on the alter that I not let these substances gain a stronghold in my life, and my gratefulness to Him for his truth and His Spirit in my heart.



I had to get up the next morning for a bible study with some folks and man did I still feel out of wack, at one point I almost had to get up and hurl in the bathroom, but I kept it together. I do not think I will do these seeds again. It is hard on me physically and produces a very edgy-uneasy state of mind, although there may be some benefit to seeing through the Matrix more clearly, sometimes this TSC, (time space continuum) is as liquid as being underwater. You swim and you can't see all that well, you can't hear all that well, and in a short time you will run out of air to keep you alive---kind of like the world we live in. Some of these medicines/drugs can pull you out of the water a bit and show you what life above the surface can be like. For some they see the meaninglessness in life or are confronted by wicked spirit beings, for others they see the beauty of what life could potentially be like free from the constraints of the physical. What they can do is reveal the Matrix for what it is, it is all of our choices what to do with that information or revelation. 



I hope your experimentation leads you to the light of the world, I hope you find real joy, hope and peace. This physical world, as clunky as it is, is inexorably tied to the spiritual plane(s), we have arms to hug, not hit. We have mouths to bless, not curse. We have eyes to appreciate, not covet. We have minds to REALLY think, not abuse. One day we will all be freed from these vessels of flesh and bone.
