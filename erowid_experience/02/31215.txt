This was my second time on this relativly new chemical and I had just purchased a small quantity and was wanting to trip with a few people, sort of `test it out' on them.  A friend of mine recently moved out and I decided that it would be best to trip where I new I could be for a good 10+ hours (this stuff lasts a LONG time).



To begin with, I set up a room with multi-colored and blinking christmas lights, as well as bringing my guitar, an effects pedal, and a microphone.  In the middle of the room I put my gnomes onto a little shrine (I always like to trip with my gnomes, it brings a greater trip) and then decided once everything was set up to start tripping.  Total, only three people were tripping that night, and two of us snorted the stuff at about 4:25 PM.  



T + 0:15   Starting to feel a little sick to the stomach.  This is actually normal for this drug because everybody i have talked to has told me they have thrown up, and the last time I did this i threw up for about 45 to 60 minutes.  Needless to say, this was no different and my friend `A' and I were both puking.  It is not actually that bad because only while I am throwing up is the experience uncomfortable. All i had to do to get over it was say `this is only the drug, this is only one of the effects, and this will pass'.  Which it did.



T + 0:35   My other friend who was tripping, `J', shows up and ingests his (up the nose) and he goes through what I have allready been through.



T + 1:30   Finally, the trip is starting.  I notice that things around me have a little bit more of a `hey come look at me and check me out' quality then normal and I find myself starting to get mild visuals, things kind of starting to move but not too much.  Around this time we decided that it was time for a drive, so we had a sober friend take us for a short trip across the dam.  Needless to say this was the shit.  Looking over to the left and seeing a lake and then to the right and seeing a park then looking down and realizing you are on something that man has made makes you think.  Especially on drugs, however, this drug does not produce mystical, bewildering thoughts like on mushrooms but more of logical, sensical thoughts. Right now i am at a +.



T + 2:00   The drive was really fun and the tracers from the lights were a definite plus, but when we got back the fun really started.  By now it was almost dark and we decided that it was time for the room.  Upon entering this small shit hole (it is about 8 x 8 maybe a little bigger) it felt like this was the place to be.  (if you were tripping, otherwise STEER CLEAR)  I started out by playing my guitar trying to trip out myself and my friends and basically just enjoying the good time.  After about 15 minutes I pulled out the microphone and hooked it up to the pitch shifter on my guitar pedal, and then hooked up headphones to pedal as well.  The effect was to lower the pitch 5 tones, so to think musically if I played a D note it would be an A note, and an easy way to hear something like this is to download music by DJ Screw.  It is the same principal.  Anyways, we just kind of passed the headphones and the mic around and started to geek each other out by pretending to be the persons concious.  



I hit the nail on the head when I pretended to be `A'.  I said to him `A, I am your concious.  Boy, you need to do something with your life.  All you do is sit around here and smoke cigarettes and wait for people to come by and get you fucked up.' It was funny because it was so true\ldots  This drug does get you into the collective conciousness, thats for sure.  



T + 3:00   By now I am into full trip mode, and it is time to smoke some weed.  My other friend who was tripping with us, `P', got a sac and we decided to smoke a few bowls.  Well, we needed a piece so enter the Ahmizzle.  This guy is seriously one of the most crazy and funniest people ever.  From jokes to impressions to stories, there is no one better, Basically the perfect person to trip with.  So he comes in and we absorb him into our world and he is having a good time.  He actually said something about a placebo trip and I told him he probably was feeling our waves and he agreed.  He is not the person that would make this up, but don't think that he was tripping balls.  He was just feeling connected and a little drunk, but i don't doubt the placebo effect.  So were smoking and listening to some music (Sublime and Tool were the only thing we listened to that night) and Ahmizzle gets the microphone and starts talking.  I don't think I have ever laughed as hard as when he was talking to me through the voice and I had the headphones on.  



He started reading an account of someone elses trip on 5-MeO-AMT (I had printed off a little info trying to get people to want to do some), but he was reading it in a dramatic/funny sort of way.  The whole time he was reading about this I noticed that his face was shifting, sort of like (i think but dont quote me on this) the bellhops face on Fear and Loathing when it gets all shifty like there is a bubble and his face was being projected on to it.  After he read the account, he started freestyling and it was probably the funniest shit ever.  I think i am near my peak, and it is about a ++.



T + 3:45   I don't know how to explain what happened at this point.  My friend `P' and I were staring off into the ceiling (everytime one certain span of lights flicked on it felt like the ceiling was coming down, but not in an I'm scared sort of way, just like `holy shit do you SEE THAT?') and then I looked at him and said `This stuff is crazy, you just don't know WHAT to expect.'  Immedietly after I said this the entire world around me became something else, maybe the way to describe it would be like a solarization effect on a video camera.  This was something that I have never experienced before, and i belive that it was a glimpse into a ++++ experience or maybe a +++ but I really do not know, except to say that it was a life changing experience.  The crazy thing was at the exact same time both of my other friends (who are not experienced trippers) had some sort of visuals or feelings that i think were the same as mine, because we were all on the same level, and at this point we were one mind.  That experience only lasted about 5 seconds, and after that it was back to ++ tripping, which was really fun.  We probably sat in that room for a total of 6 hours just tripping each other out.



T + 6:00  After tripping in the room and coming out and going back in and shit, we decided to watch a movie.  Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze, won.  This movie was dumb as fuck and I kept thinking how hokey it was.  After watching this movie we watched the first Ninja Turtles movie, which was just as retarded except for the part where Splinter explains how the turtles were created.  Actually, any part with Splinter was real tight, and the only way to explain this is to trip and watch the movies.  It's like Splinter is the wise trip guide.



I don't really remember much of anything after this, except that I was feeling really good about myself.  I had a slight backache the next morning and my head kind of hurt, but that could be a result of snorting it.  Overall, I would say that i like this experience and will do it again.



MY WARNING: YOU ARE GOING TO THROW UP NO MATTER HOW BAD ASS YOU ARE OR THINK YOU ARE.  DRINK A LOT OF WATER BEFORE YOU INGEST AND EAT SOME PROTEIN FILLED FOOD ABOUT 5 HOURS BEFORE YOU TRIP.  DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL THE DAY BEFORE, DURING, OR THE DAY AFTER.
