To begin, I would like to say that I had used 25I-NBOMe once before this experience, but only 1/3 the dose that I took this time. I thought I knew what to expect but what happened was so much different than what I had experienced before, and I mean with any psychedelic.



Setting: In my fraternity house, with one of my brothers, who I will call N.



Time: Around 8:30pm



I had been out all afternoon with a couple of my buddies at a campground, drinking beer and relaxing for the afternoon, however, I didn't eat anything all day and I was pretty tired afterwards. I was a little hesitant about taking my NBOMe since I didn't know how my body would react in such a state, but, I did promise my brother, N, who had never taken NBOMe, that we would have one hell of a night of the stuff.



I got back to the house and found my brother and showed him the blotter tabs we were going to be taking, each one was 1000 ug, and very colorful. I instructed him to place the blotter in his mouth, under his tongue and keep it there for about 15 minutes before discarding it. So he placed it in his mouth, as did I, and we sat down watching TV in his room for about 45 minutes before deciding to see what one of my other friends was up to. At that point, the tip of my tongue was quite numb, and my body started feeling a little lighter, but nothing crazy as far as CEVs or OEVs.



N and I went into our buddy's room, who knew that we were on some ``crazy new drug,'' since we had told them earlier that we were experimenting. They invited us to watch TV with them while they smoked some weed. So we sat down on the couch and chilled out while we waited for our reality to warp.



The first thing I started noticing, about an hour and a half in, was that when I closed my eyes, I saw afterimages of what I was just looking at, but the images were weird, rainbow-like colors. I kinda thought that was weird but not too crazy. I could feel the euphoria kicking in slowly, as conversation became more and more interesting and exciting. I laughed a lot more and enjoyed the company of everyone around me much more than usual.



As time went on, about 2 hours in, things started to get weird. I would find myself focusing on random parts of the room, such as the table or the carpet, as if they were putting me into a trance. As I focused, parts of the object began to swim and move like little snakes in a pond. As I focused on the table in front of me, I noticed fractals forming and spinning around into themselves. Something even weirder happened when I focused on the carpet. It began to go through mitosis, that is, the little patterns I could see began to split and multiply, spinning around all the while. The lights in the room began to flicker and sparkle and I found myself perplexed with a Rubik's cube that was in front of me. I thought it was made of rubber, but it was solid to the touch, which confused me beyond belief. I thought this was the extent of my hallucinations but little did I know that this was only the beginning.



After about 3 hours, another one of my friends came into the room, slightly drunk with a desire to smoke some weed. My other friends informed him that N and I were tripping on some new drug and he seemed very interested. He kept asking me what I was seeing and how I was feeling, which I responded to very eagerly. He then noticed me staring at the lights on the ceiling and smiled and said, ``Oh, wait a second, you're gonna love this.'' I started to get excited as he brought out a device that looked like a projector from behind a desk in the room. Then, he turned off the lights and switched on the device, which I soon realized was a laser projector that emitted little green lights on the roof that moved around in a circular motion. I was so amazed with the dots that I found myself staring at them for a good 10 or 15 minutes. As I focused more and more on them, I began to realize that the ceiling had depth to it, like it was replaced by the night sky and I was looking into the depths of space. Soon, a blue cloud formed in the ceiling and morphed into a creature that immediately reminded me of the Buddha, but the 6 arms and horns. He was a deep blue and his mouth was opening in closing in a robotic motion, like he was trying to tell me something. He began to grow and grow until the apparent void of space filled the room and it was just me and the being that I was seeing. I was so perplexed with this thing that I was looking at and began to wonder what he was, and more importantly, what he was trying to tell me. Then, something miraculous happened. I could hear him talking in my head, but nothing was coming out of his mouth. I was listening through my brain, not my ears. He told me that he was a being of a higher dimension, made of pure energy. He oversaw the creation of people that would enter the 3rd dimension before they existed in the minds of humans. He told me that all humans, in his world, were just shells made of skin and contained nothing inside them until he filled them with the life energy that he was made of. He made my body experience what it felt like to not have this energy within me and it was incredible. I instantly felt like a steel shell, with nothing inside me but a metal ball that would rattle around and vibrate my outer casing. Soon, I returned to my normal bodily feeling and noticed the immense difference. He began to morph slowly into other objects like a giant woman's eye and lips, however, I did not understand why. I journeyed further into the space, which I concluded wasn't outer space at all, but rather pure blackness, that I will call the Void. As I journeyed through the Void, I became very bored, very quickly, as absolutely nothing existed there. Even existence itself did not exist. It was pure nothingness, yet somehow this being, made of pure energy, thrived there. Alone. Creating things and sending them on their way. Slowly, the Void started shrinking away from my vision and the being that I saw started shrinking away with it. I was returning to reality.



After seeing these events and leaving reality, I found myself back in the room with my friends, who didn't seem to notice me entering the trance state that I was in. So I leaned my head back and closed my eyes and, let me tell you, the CEVs were amazing. I saw patterns and fractals in a brilliant display of colors exploding all over. Shapes of rainbow colors and flashing objects flew across the inside of my eyelids and it was beautiful. I opened my eyes and tried explaining what I just saw but everything that came out of my mouth made no sense to them. It's like describing a color to a blind person, impossible to convey without experiencing it. My friends were talking but I didn't comprehend anything they were saying. I could understand the words, but not the phrases. My brain had just experienced something so intense that I had a time delay in returning to reality again.



About another hour in, my high friends decided to order some food for delivery (big surprise). When the food arrived, I was pretty hungry from the secondhand smoke that filled the room and decided to eat a little bit. As my friend picked up the food, he exclaimed that the food was scorching hot and that I should be careful with it. I grabbed the food and, to my amazement, it wasn't hot at all. My friends stared in amazement as I ate the scalding food with ease while they couldn't even put it near their mouth. I was utterly amazed and perplexed that my sense of feeling was dulled this much, yet I didn't let it phase me, I just kept on eating while they all stared in amazement. What was even weirder was that the food didn't satisfy any sense of hunger that I had, I just ate and swallowed and didn't feel any different at all. Food had no taste, yet I enjoyed eating it. It was remarkable.



My hallucinations began to die down about 4 hours in. I still observed waving and lots of tracers, but they were not nearly as intense as before. I sat back and relaxed for a little while and just thought. All I wanted to do was think to myself and think about random things. I must have sat there in complete silence, just pondering things for a good hour. It was very entertaining. It was at this point that I had the weirdest feeling throughout my body. I felt like my skin was melting off in layers and that everything I held in my hand was melting through my fingers. It didn't scare me, but rather perplexed me. I kind of enjoyed the feeling as it wasn't painful at all, it was, should I say, fun? As you can imagine, it's very hard to describe. But it added to the amazing body high that I had throughout the entire experience.



At about 5 hours in, N and I decided to go to bed. I was pretty tired at this point, but I found sleeping very difficult due to a massive headache that I had and the fact that everything I stared at was moving. The floor looked like liquid concrete and I found that comical for some reason. Soon, however, sleepiness took over and I lay down to go to sleep. The entire experience lasted around 5.5 hours.



Conclusion: I realized the next day that what I had experienced was other-worldly. I still needed a couple days to process everything I had seen to discover the meaning of these visions I had. It was very intense and very satisfying.



Body High: ++

Mental High: +++

Adverse Effects: bad headache after and trouble sleeping, but all gone after sleep

Chance of reuse: 40\%
