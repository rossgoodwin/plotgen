I'd read about Hawaiian Baby Woodrose and LSA trips on the internet for quite some time, and after finally receiving some in the mail from an online supplier I decided to give them a try.



I crushed 10 seeds up with a half a brick until they were in fairly small pieces. I then put these pieces in a bottle of Spring Water in the fridge, and left it in there for roughly two hours, shaking every fifteen minutes. By the two hour mark the water was a fairly dark green, at which point I decided enough of the LSA had been extracted.



It was time to seperate the seed bits from the rest of the liquid, but I soon realised I had nothing to do this with. I decided to seperate the seed pulp from the spring water by pouring from one cup to another, and managed to keep most of the seed grit in the bottom of one cup, though there were very small pieces of seed that I ended up swallowing. It tasted like bark sort of but not too bad. A little honey countered the aftertaste. I drank it not too slowly, over the space of about 5 minutes.



I sat and watched for any signs the LSA was starting to kick in. At around half an hour after ingestion I noticed a flickering on my peripheral vision, on the top, bottom and sides. Interesting, I thought. I seem to remember something similar while high on weed, though I'm not too sure.



At around one hour the flickering was more pronounced, kind of like what you see when there's a fan spinning just inside your peripheral vision. At around this same time I noticed the afterimage of the computer screen or other lights stayed with me for a lot longer than they normally would, like I could look at the screen then up at the roof and could quite clearly see a negative image of the screen for a good minute or two. It was hard to tell with a lot of these effects whether I was just imagining them or if it was really happening, as they were quite mild, though I later tested to see how long the afterimage of the computer screen remained on my retina while sober and it was only something like 10-20 seconds, rather than a full minute or two. 



Music didn't sound profoundly better, though when my housemate put on some Bob Dylan I almost enjoyed it (I normally hate Bob Dylan) and when she put on Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon it set me off into odd thought processes and a sort of a day-dream, where I was picturing in my mind the things that were making the sounds in the music, like running footsteps and lasers shooting. They all seemed to be part of some story. I found throughout the trip I felt somewhat sedated - it felt very comfortable just lying around, I didn't really want to move and had the urge to lie on the carpeted floor alot. There were no real OEV's or CEV's, things just looked slightly odd, like the tree branch outside seemed to resemble some sort of creature, and the light playing off the water coming from the hose my housemate was watering with looked beautiful.



The peak came later than I expected, around 5 o'clock. I went upstairs to go to the toilet. When I looked into the toilet bowl little bubbles morphed into a sea-horse shape and then a smiling face, which I waved at. I put my face right up to the patterned glass on the window which looked like it was made up of many different little figures and things, and laughed at it for a few seconds in a sort of a quiet wheezing laugh, like that cartoon dog I think is named Mutley. 



Still smiling I then walked into the bathroom to check out my pupils. They were about twice as big as usual, which I knew was a good sign. I turned around and began to stumble out, at which point I noticed the house had taken on a sort of funhouse-like character. The walls and roof seemed to be at slightly odd angles, just like in a funhouse or a cartoon. I found this to be quite funny as well, though it seemed to stop by the time I got downstairs to where my housemate was.



At some point she went upstairs, so I decided to lie on my stomach on the carpet. (I highly recommend this as it is very comfortable). I looked forwards and heard my wingflaps lowering - yes that's right, for some reason I was suddenly a futuristic ship of some sort, or at least my head was, I didn't really notice my body. 



Note: It is important to note at this point that I didn't actually fully believe I was a space ship, just that it was extremely easy to `pretend' I was a spaceship (though it felt almost real) and suspend disbelief as a child would. Its very hard to explain unless you've felt something similar 

yourself.



I powered up my systems and made a whooshing sound (either with my mouth or an aural hallucination, I'm still not sure which) and I was away, rushing forwards along the carpet. I wasn't really moving but it felt like I was, I could even sort of see the movement of the `landscape' around me. I stopped, then fired lasers at the door, then the bottom leg of the computer desk. I then pretty much gave up on this game, and just looked down at the carpet directly in front of my face, which suddenly seemed extremely close and incredibly detailed. And also, for a moment or two it felt like I was leaning up against some soft wall, rather than lying down on a carpet. I said `holy crap', then, hearing my housemate coming back down the stairs jumped to my feet and back onto the couch in my previous relaxed position, as I didn't want her to find me lying face down on the carpet saying `holy crap' over and over again (she thinks I'm nuts already without me doing that). 



I sat and looked at two plastic figurines on the other side of the room, who in the lower light seemed to be moving just a little and looking at each other, which reminded me exactly of when I was a little kid, lying in my bed at night watching the things in my room seem to move, but knowing that they weren't actually moving at all.



That's about all that really is worth telling about this trip. It lasted I guess for about 5 hours, peaking at between 3.5 and 4.5 hours. There was a slight sense of nausea in the beginning which lasted about an hour, but it wasn't really noticeable and didn't affect me too much. I didn't feel any of the tightness behind my knees or anywhere like I've read some people have experienced in other reports, but this may have to do with the way I ingested the seeds. There was a general sense of silliness and uncoordination throughout, not unlike being slightly drunk, but my mind was mostly clear and I was able to think pretty much soberly most of the time, (except for when I thought I was a spaceship I guess!).  It was definitely interesting and I will be trying this again, perhaps with slightly more seeds, around 14? a longer water extraction time maybe or perhaps just eaten straight or taken sublingually so I don't need as many, and possibly with someone else who is also tripping which I imagine would intensify things somewhat :)
