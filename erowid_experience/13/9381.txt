Some months ago a coworker mentioned an interesting substance his roommate (a chemist) had cooked up, that could make you `drunk', but without the hangover the next day.  He couldn't remember it's name though, so nothing came of that conversation at that time.



Then I came across a description of GHB.  It matched what he'd talked about, so I made it my mission to obtain and try the stuff.  With some effort, I got my hands on 75mL of GBL, got the rest of what I needed from a hardware store, and one evening produced about 80g of a beautiful white powder (the sodium salt version, NaGHB).



I didn't put that much thought into set/setting, being impatient I wanted to try it *now*.  I didn't have any reliable way to measure small amounts of the stuff, so I made an assumption that a level teaspoon equaled 2g (EDITOR'S NOTE: This is conjecture), so I took half a teaspoon dissolved in orange juice.  Salty orange juice just tastes wrong.  There were some mild effects, onset was about 30 minutes, duration about 30 minutes, I was disappointed overall.  I later got quite hungry (ravenous would be a good description), went out with a sibling and basically gorged.  Mistake \#1.



Later that evening, about 5 hours after eating, I decided to try a proper dose.  I knew that your typical large dose was 3g, I decided that due to my weight, I'd try 4g.  I rigged up a crude scale, tested it with known weights (it worked surprisingly well, accurate to about 0.5g), and measured out 4g.  I dissolved this in plain water this time, and sat back watching Teletoon.



T+00:15 - Onset, felt like I'd had a few drinks, but nothing too special

T+00:45 - Felt like I'd had 8 drinks or so, but still had unusual control

T+01:00 - Suddenly everything on TV seemed like a work of genuis.  I also felt inexplicably happy, euphoric.  I had an urge to share this feeling with the entire cosmos.  Colours were warmer, music seeped directly into my soul, and tactile sensations were incredible.

T+01:45 - Just as suddenly, I started to return to baseline - or so it felt.  I decided to keep this going, and took another 4g.  Mistake \#2.

T+02:00 - Sudden burst of energy, a frenzy you might say.  Started running around like an idiot, literally bouncing off the walls.  Only lasted a few minutes.

T+02:15 - First warning signs.  I now felt like I'd had an entire bottle of vodka, walking was difficult but possible (I had this sense that I was lurching everywhere), and the first signs of nausea appeared.  I lost almost all tactile sensation as well, which worried me less than it should have.

T+02:30 - Now I'm fighting the nausea big time.  I end up sitting beside the toilet, waiting for the inevitable\ldots  

T+03:45 - \ldots and wake up lying on the bathroom floor.  I apparently passed out for over an hour, and the inevitable hadn't happened.  Relieved, I stand up - and then make a sudden dive for the toilet bowl.  I heaved so hard that I burst a few capillaries around my eyes, looked like I had a rash around my eyes for two days.

T+04:00 - I'm feeling fine now\ldots  better than fine, actually.  I'm back where I was at T+1:00.  Putting the unpleasantness of the last few minutes behind me, I further explore the senses\ldots   unusual minor twitching in my forearms and feet, not unpleasant though.

T+05:00 - I got hungry, had some plain bread.  I'm also pretty much at baseline at this point.

T+05:30 - Sleep is far, far away.  I feel exhausted, but restless as well.  I took another 2g, and fell asleep shortly aftewards.



I woke up after only 4 hours of sleep, but with some effort managed to get 4 more fitful hours.  I felt pretty much normal that day, aside from a slight feeling of pressure behind the eyes and some photosensitivity.  My mood was definitely upbeat, with quite a lot of creative energy to burn\ldots  too much in fact, there wasn't enough time to do everything that I wanted to do.  Two days later, I'm back to my usual self.



My first piece of advice to anyone who's determined to try GHB (or any drug for that matter): Don't have a heavy meal that day!  Next time I try this, I'm having a light, bland meal at least 4 hours beforehand. Second, get your dosage right!  4g is probably my `comfort zone', as I experienced some very positive things before I started to go back to baseline, but I'm a 260lb male with a higher-than-average tolerance to most things (alcohol, caffeine, pain relievers, anesthetic, etc).  Do the research, calculate the correct dose for your size, and then try *half* that (some texts say to try an *eigth*, in case there's an allergic reaction), and see where it takes you.  As I said, I probably did correctly choose my dose, but as I started to come down, I *doubled* it by taking another 4g! There was still quite a bit left in my system, I was only 1 hour 45 minutes into it. Most texts recommend waiting at least 3 to 5 hours between doses, I tend to agree based on my experience.



GHB is powerful stuff and makes no allowance for your mistakes; it's too easy to get it wrong.  But in my opinion, when it's done properly it can be quite rewarding.
