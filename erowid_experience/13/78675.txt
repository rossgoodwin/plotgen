Background and stats: 

-22 year old female, 5'1', about 105 or 110 pounds. 
-Clinically depressed, frequent suicidal thoughts with mild ADHD and anxiety.
-frequent alcohol and marijuana user, experience with nutmeg, DXM
-previous pharm experience with Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Celexa, Zoloft, Prozac, Ambien
-Prescribed Vyvanse for ADHD and to encourage sociability after Wellbutrin failed to do anything.
-Important to note, I suffer from Hyperhydrosis, a genetic disorder that causes abnormal amounts of sweating from my hands and feet. This causes me a lot of social problems, but more importantly for this report, it causes dehydration from drug use to happen much faster and more frequently.


It is apparently becoming increasingly difficult to get psychiatrists to prescribe Adderall over Vyvanse because of Vyvanse's chemical composition which makes it act more slowly over a longer period of time, decreasing abuse potential. Whatever, lets try anyway!

9:00 AM - Take 150mg of Lisdexamfetamine in 5 30mg capsules at once. Drink about 30 ounces of water.

9:30 AM - Get a biscuit and some hashbrowns from chik-fil-a. MMM!

10:00 AM - no major effects, notice a slight elevation of mood.

10:22 AM - Notice repeated chills causing goosebumps all over body, pleasurable. Sense of well-being and slightly blurred vision. Increased amount of sweating from palms. 

10:30 AM - Notice increased mood elevation still, like I am slowly creeping towards what I hope to be a very pleasurable euphoria. Sweating is still there, but I don't care, dry mouth is happening too. I live in a HOT state, so this doesn't help at all.

11:00 AM - I feel really high. My brain is totally wired right now and feels amazing. The Euphoria is very strong and highly pleasurable. Watching a TV show online, it is overly interesting. I am not very religious, but I feel like praying for some reason and do so for about 15 minutes. I feel somewhat spiritually connected to God at this point; it was interesting and instilled me with a lot of hope and security toward my future. I notice some minor/basic visual hallucinations - mostly just tracers behind lights and stuff like that.

11:30 AM - Feeling very good, in a very pleasant state of euphoria, hopeful about the day, looking forward to life for once! Have a counseling appointment at 1:00 with a psychologist at my universities counseling center. I have a date at 6:00 with an older guy I've been seeing. I feel very good about today.  

2:00 PM - Euphoria has basically worn off; however I have a good head buzz going. I have A LOT of energy, and felt extremely wired and talkative - I am usually a very shy girl. In my meeting with my counselor, and opened up about a lot of things with her, I felt extremely comfortable. She noticed my change in demeanor and I told her about the medication. 

Towards the end of the session she told me that I would likely need to seek counseling outside of the universities center because my problems with loneliness and depression are so long term. As a long term user of the universities counseling center I would normally be somewhat devastated by this, and I was frustrated and confused, but I did not feel totally horrible for some reason. I attribute this continued suspension in contentment and happiness to the pills.

3:00 PM - I receive a phone call from the man I am dating and would be seeing that night. He informs me that we should probably no longer date because our age range bothers him (he is 29 and I am 22) and he can't get over it. I find this somewhat devastating as I really enjoyed spending time with him, but I manage to find a common ground of understanding and we say we will still be friends - even though we will probably never speak again. I am pretty emotionally fragile, and an event like this would normally have sent me spiraling into a depression, but it didn't; once again I thank Vyvanse for saving me from falling off the emotional cliff.

5:00 PM - energy levels still very high. I am reading and studying various subjects, and reading as much information about Vyvanse on the internet that I can find. Mood is still good, but I think the peak has basically passed. Sweating and dry mouth remain. 

7:00 PM - I notice that I have not eaten all day since morning; I go to Wendy's and get a salad and some fries. I notice that it seems I don't really crave food at all. Appetite is all but gone, and I force myself to eat the food. At this point I have probably drank about 200 fluid ounces of water in the day, and still feel quite dehydrated. I really wish I was on that date, because I still feel extremely talkative and have no one to talk to!

8:30 PM - I can feel myself coming down. Still wired and able to concentrate easily, but I can feel the depression seeping back into my head. I am reading a lot of things on the internet and taking a lot of interest in them still.

9:45 PM - Reflecting on the days rather negative events, depression/minor suicidal thoughts ensues unfortunately. I'm not sure if I am crashing totally or if the drug is just wearing off slowly. 

10:00 PM - I prepare a bowl of weed and smoke it over the course of 5-10 minutes. This relieves any depression/self destructive feelings I was having.

10:30 PM - I prepare about half a bowl and smoke it. I am pretty high from this. The amphetamines are still felt strongly though, I'm still somewhat wired and focused. The combination seems to make me rather antsy, I can't stop moving my legs and fidgeting. 

11:00 PM - the amount of weed I smoked combined with the coming down from the vyvanse has made me really tired, I get into bed and think for 15-20 minutes until I fall asleep.

The next morning I am pretty dehydrated, somewhat depressed, but I feel okay and relieved that Vyvanse could provide me with some happiness and contentment for a while. Sort of ironic that I feel hopeful about being able to abuse a prescription drug, but that's fine with me!
