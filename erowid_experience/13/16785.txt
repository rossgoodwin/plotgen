I recently attended a Rave in Oregon where I experimented with 5-MeO-DiPT for the first time.



I had decided to `try out' the drug at about 1:00p on Saturday before the second night of the Rave got into full swing. I made some inquiries and acquire four doses of Foxy in gelcaps that held about 7-8 milligrams a piece from someone who had a history of supplying unadulterated substances in the past.



I took my first dose at about 1:30p and waited about thirty to forty minutes before I began to feel any effects. They came on quite quickly after my first sensation and grew in intensity rapidly. The overwhelming feeling was that of a strong body high, similar to that induced by psychedelic mushrooms but `dirtier' by comparison. Some mild nausea also bothered me for another thirty minutes after onset.  



T+1:10 

I decided to take my second dose. 



T+1:20 to T+1:40

While waiting for my second capsule to kick in I quickly realized that I may have made my decision to imbibe a second a bit hastily as the body high grew in intensity. It further increased when my second dose kicked in around T+1:45 or so. 



Throughout this experience the body high was accompanied by an overwhelming feeling of uneasiness and the `dirty' quality of the sensation also magnified. Unlike MDMA, the sensation felt very unnatural, very chemical in origin, as if I was wearing a skin of `intoxication.' An overwhelming desire to peel off my skin accompanied this high and began to feel agitated as a result. 



T+2:15 

I started to notice some mild visual effects (tracers, blurring and shaking). I also noticed that I was feeling somewhat aroused and my sense of touch was greatly enhanced. Small amounts of pain became extremely satisfying and relaxing to me.



T+2:30 to T+4:00 

I found myself on a plateau, with a sense of `coming down' occurring at about T+4:15 to T+5:00. Once disturbing quality of this drug seemed to be the way I came down since I would intermittently feel completely sober and then completely drugged, with no periods of mixed sensation. 



T+6:30

The periods of sensation continued to decrease until about this period, when I decided to ingest a small quantity (about half of 1/8) of psychedelic mushrooms. I began to feel the onset of the mushrooms very quickly. 



T+6:55 

I began to feel the effects of the mushrooms and noticed increased visuals. 



T+7:10 

I took my third hit of 5-MeO-DiPT and waited for it to quick in as the mushrooms maintained a comfortably soft body high. One interesting thing I noticed was that the mushrooms (combined with a hit or two of cannabis) seemed to snap me back into the sensations I felt on just Foxy earlier in the day. 



I estimate it was about T+7:35 

My third dose of the Foxy kicked in (I had not eaten for almost eight hours at this point) and I found the sensations even more intense. While I still felt somewhat agitated and my sense of touch was still greatly enhanced I found that the nausea was almost completely gone. The `dirty' body high was also noticeably absent and I theorize that the mushrooms helped alleviate some of my previous discomfort.



The rest of the evening continued uneventfully with my plateau beginning at around T+8:15 and continuing for sometime until I imbibed my fourth (and final) dose of the Foxy at around T+10:00. Nothing changed until around T+10:30 when my fourth hit kicked in and I began to notice the `dirty' body high again, though it was much gentler this time. 



I estimate that the mushrooms began to exit my system at around T+11:10 as it was about this time the `dirty' body high resumed it's earlier full-blown intensity. I was able to deal with better this time as I was more accustomed to it and as it came on much slower I was able to adjust to it far better.



I was settling in for reasonably good evening when at T+11:35 or so I began to experience very strong visuals and hallucinations. For the next several hours I found it difficult to speak coherently or walk in a specific direction. I often found myself engaging in activities for several minutes before suddenly finding myself back where I had begun and in the exact same moment.



It was enjoyable for a few hours but at about 4:00am (T+15:00) I began to feel very unsettled as the experience was in no way diminishing. I also began to experience uncontrollable muscle contractions in my face, abdomen and thighs. This contractions `flickered' all over my body and made it incredibly difficult to do anything comfortably, or to relax for any period of time. Coupled with even stronger `out of body' tripping I was beginning to panic as I could not shut the experience out and I found myself desperate for some sort of nervous system depressant to let me sleep. 



Finally at T+17:00 (6:00am) the hallucinations stopped and the entire high left me abruptly. So abruptly in fact that I found myself shaking from the sudden shift, although I was ecstatic at my experience finally having ended. I was still unable to sleep for another two hours or so but once I finally managed to shut my eyes and lose consciousness I found myself mostly recovered upon waking a few hours later though I did experience a few momentary hallucinations and body twitches throughout the remainder of the day.
