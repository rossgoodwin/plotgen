I wanted to record the affects of a huge dose of Zopiclone, so I got everything ready, including a report log I could type on as I tripped. The experience was intense and humiliating to say the least. My actual written report only goes from 6:00PM to 9:00PM, but the experience of what I did continues well into the night. I am never doing this again, but I thought I'd share it instead of letting it go to waste. First I will post a cleaned up version of my original drug log, and then I will elaborate on this and write about what happened after I left the computer. Anything added to the original log will be placed in brackets.



6:00 PM -- Popped 10 7.5mg Zipoclone with water. Feeling normal. I am on an empty stomach and completely sober.



6:10 PM -- I still feel normal.



6:20 PM -- I feel a bit dizzy. My hands and legs tingle.



6:30 PM -- I feel a bit dizzy. I am stumbling a bit. But so far I feel very close to normal.



6:40 PM -- Feeling zoned out. I am having trouble typing. I don't feel sleepy. 



6:45 PM -- I feel light-headed. Walking is unstable. I am having trouble typing and reading.



6:50 PM -- Movement is very rocky. I can't keep myself walking straight for long. I feel drunk without the eurphoria or sensation loss drinking gives you. Slight headache. (At this point, due to the affects of the drug, my memory will not function right until the next morning.)



6:55 PM -- Memory problems. I just feel drunk to the point that I am talking to myself and stumbling around. I can barely type right anymore. STRONG euphoria felt right now and it's growing.



7:00 PM - I feel very giggly and happy. I am having strange brain shocks CONSTANTLY now. Eye and hand coordination is bad, and I am having trouble learning to set and use words properly. Reading is becoming difficult. I am stumbling BAD. It's easy for me to suddenly fall down now. I am giddy though, Happy. I don't feel tired at all but actually pretty energetic. (The original entry showed enough typos and mixed up words to prove my assertion clearly.)



7:10 PM -- VERY DRUNK, uncoordinationed, thoughts are strange. Giggling and happy, and wanting to jump around and do stuff. I feel motivated. I am starting to feel a bit tired though.



7:20 PM -- Same as above.



7:30 PM -- Popped 4 7.5mg Zopiclone. (A second dose was never intended, but I was starting to lose all control over myself at this point.) I still feel loopy and dizzy and drunk.



7:40 PM -- Popped 3 2mg Ativan. (I have no idea why I took this. I think I was just chasing highs now and mixing drugs for fun.) I still feel a bit crazy, and started talking too myself again. I want some alcohol badly.



7:50 PM -- Drank 750ml 12 proof wild vines raspberry wine. I feel very drunk and strange. I am having constant brainshocks for some reason.



8:00 PM -- I am getting more and more drunk. The booze in the wine is making me happy. I don't feel tired all. I am totally uncoordinated, and I can barely keep myself upright. I am getting drunk rapidly. I feel extremely happy. I have no care in the world. Everything is fine. (This entry was much longer, but so full of typos and sentences that made no sense that I had take only what I could figure out, cutting it down by half.)



8:15 PM -- Took 15 100mg caffeine pills.



8:30 PM -- Memory is strange. I was walking down the hall and forgot why, and I don't remember even writing the stuff above. I feel a bit sick in the stomach. I am doing math with limited success. (I don't know why I was doing math) I feel very happy.



8:45 PM - Drunk, delirious, and trying to get a wine bottle open. (Soon after I downed another bottle of 750ml 12 proof wild vines raspberry wine.)



9:00 PM -- Drunk and very happy about life. I am about to show my parents my drinking problem.



The log ended there. The rest of the night was retold to me by the various witnesses involved. I stumbled into my parent's room, screaming and talking randomly about everything, drunk as hell. I started throwing stuff around, swearing at everyone I met, and laughing a lot. Apparently I kept complaining of seeing visions and vivid hallucinations and it was horrifying me.



I became extremely sexual, so when the cops came by I hit on them again and again, and soon they had little choice but to call the ambulance due to the huge amount of drugs I had obviously ingested. I was rude to everyone at the hospital. I pulled my IV out, pissed all over the nurse picking some stuff I threw down for some reason, and even offered to give the cops blowjobs if they let me go. The Doctors confirmed that other than completely out of my mind, I was fine to go, but my parents refused to let me come home, so I was tossed into the drunk tank. Apparently this entire time I kept asking what was going on, because my `memory was off' as the cops said, I couldn't remember what I said a half minute ago, or even why I was where I was.



He also recalled me having conversations with people who weren't there, suddenly going from outright depressed, to happy, to angry, and then back again, for no reason. I also kept asking to go to prison so I could be `gangraped', and that I wanted to jerk off right there.



When thrown into the drunk tank I took a shit all over, tried eating it and had to be tasered to stop, pissed under the door, jerked off in the tank, thrown all of my clothing off and dunked my head in the toilet, attacked a cop and had a shot of mace in my face, and I even had entire conversations with invisible people. I was out of my mind.



At about 5:00 AM I snapped out of it when the drugs finally wore off, and I was confused. Due to having no memory of the night before because Zopiclone destroys your ability to make memories while on it--hence why I kept a log ready so I could record as I tripped--I was horrified. There was I, naked, in a sealed room with water everywhere, smelling like piss and shit, and handcuffed to the wall. The next few hours were the most terrifying few hours of my life as nobody came to my aid, and I wouldn't be allowed out for another six hours.



In conclusion, I am not taking that much Zopiclone ever again. My memory was totally gone, so I suspect I was freely doing drugs without knowing I had just done drugs, it also caused me to snap, along with the other stuff I took, and turned me into a completely sexual nut case. High doses are apparently very pleasurable as what I wrote in the log said, but my judgment and inhibitions were so impaired I just might nearly destroy myself. When I woke up I thought I had died and gone to hell. Not fun.



Much to my joy, though, I had no hangover at all!
