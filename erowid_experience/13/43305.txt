Well it all began one evening when I was walking home and happened to stumble across some little red and white spotted mushrooms. I thought to myself `Well, I have heard they're hallucinogenic, so why not?' and went online that night and did some researching, just in case. I found there are 2 types that look very similar, the Amanita Muscaria and the Amanita Pantherina and to tell the truth I'm not sure which is which and am not 100\% sure which one I ended up eating, but back to the story. I picked them the next day and they were quite large, red and plump and after drying them for several day I was amazed at how much they shriveled. Dried, one was 3cm across, one was about 4cm across and one was about 6cm across. The end result was probably only 1-2 ounces IF that. I wanted to start with a smaller dose, here it goes:



Date: 25th May 2005



Time: Around 3:20pm when the 2 smaller caps \& stems were ingested



State of mind: Emotionally drained and deeply upset. I had broken up with my long term partner and wanted to see if the mushrooms would calm me down or just make me think about something else, ANYTHING else. I also had a drink of Pernod and water before I ate the mushrooms, another sedative for my irrational state of mind.



So I put my coat on and set off for a walk because I really had nothing else to do.



4:45pm - I was heading home and I started to feel a little nauseous and gooey in the tummy, plus I was the teensiest bit light headed.



Around 5.00pm - At home. Feeling slightly fluffy in the head, I almost felt stuffy. I lost some co-ordination and walked into my own car in the driveway. I wasn't quite as upset though.



Between 5pm and 6pm - I sat in my room and turned the heater on but felt SO cold. I looked around and started to feel like I was mildly tipsy, like when I only have 2 drinks but drink them in about 5 seconds. A slight alcohol buzz, but my body felt strange. Thick, heavy, in a way. I just couldn't warm up tho, and my body was feeling heavier and heavier, things were feeling thicker, my brain felt like it was normal but also running as super speed and yet also thinking abut nothing.



As for feeling upset, I felt fine. My brain wouldn't LET me think about breaking up with my boyfriend, I actually couldn't THINK about it. I tried and I just couldn't. I was blank. I thought about other things, weird things that make no sense. I admit I don't even remember what some of those things were. It was like I was talking to someone in my own brain, like a 3rd person, almost commentating my own life. Very odd.



I also realised I was restless, my hands wouldn't sit still, they moved everywhere, touching things, touching my face and arms. I was also rocking slowly backwards and forwards a lot \& found myself rocking violently side to side in time with a song on the radio and didn't realise I was doing it at all. Also, I noticed I was lethargic, VERY lethargic, and didn't want to talk, like my brain was disconnected from my mouth. I had no energy to do ANYTHING and suddenly felt SO tired and so hungry! I devoured 2 sausage rolls and a pack of biscuits (crashing into several things while looking for them!) then lay down to nap but was too cold even tho my skin was burning from sitting too close to the heater. Feeling overall slightly buzzed, clammy and heavy.



6:30pm - I realised I'd been almost napping and needed to let my pet ferret in so I went to get him. The outside was SO cold it was horrible. I let my ferret run riot then fell asleep again, kind off, and woke up about 8pm.



8:00pm - I woke up suddenly realising SHIT I have to feed my ferret. Physically, the mushrooms were wearing off. I till felt somewhat heavy but that's it. Mentally tho, it was weird. I heard another voice in the back of my head constantly commentating everything I did, sometimes I heard this person tell me what my ferret was saying (!?) I honestly can't remeber what it was saying 100\% of the time but at ONE TIME it was 2 people, talking about ME, saying `Yes, this robot was made to work like this' and they were talking about me as if I was a robot made to work as a maid. And it seemed VERY real, like I was a robot. It was ODD. My ferret did a poop in the middle of the hallway and I was there cleaning it up and I an NO idea how long I was there but I looked down and there was nothing on the floor so I must have done a bloody good job cos I can't really remember getting it off, and the voices were still there, talking AT me.



NOW - 12:20am. I'm sober. Sounds still seem a little muffled and funny, by body feels slowish but I'm basically back to normal. I'm drinking red wine at the moment as I'm starting to think about the break up again.



CONCLUSION: I didn't think such a small amount would have ANY effect but it did, I felt so DIFFERENT. NO real visual illusions but definate mental illusions. I would do it again with a larger amount so I had some weird things to look at too. Overall, it was fun, I'd do it again, and I had no side effects and only minimal nausea!
