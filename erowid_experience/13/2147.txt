Subject: Poppy Seed Info Needed\ldots .



Hello Everyone,



I'm new to this LISTSERV, but I have an extremely urgent request that perhaps only YOU in the Internet community can help with now\ldots .



My wife recently moved to Arizona to start her `Dream Job' (offered in July) and was given the standard pre-employment physical at a local hospital.  She was given no warnings of what NOT to eat, and I believe was not even asked what she had recently eaten.  She ate two poppy seed muffins that morning and registered a positive morphine level on their drug test that afternoon.  She was fired because she was a `drug abuser'.



There are a few other circumstances that seem to have complicated this situation.  We've found out that the NIDA suggested limit is 300; she scored about 1,000 and we are trying to figure out `why'.  The nurse said she was extremely dehydrated (after working in 100-degree temperatures) and that her keytones (?) were high (she had eaten very little the last few days).  She is also vegetarian.  We've heard that these other factors may have been the reason for her score, but we have no solid medical research to back this up\ldots .



Does anyone out there know of any research or other cases that can help us prove the truth?  Is there another LISTSERV with someone who could provide this information?  Are there any experts out there we could talk to?  Any suggestions you have would be appreciated!



We are trying to get the actual lab results (and will ask for a re-test of

the same samples), but the hospital has been very slow in giving us a

copy.  She also had a surprise test which proved clear, but they discounted

these results because a `drug-abuser would have expected a second test'.



We are now trying to prove the truth so my wife can keep her Nursing

license and her livelihood.  Previous to this test, we thought these drug

tests were a good idea; as you can imagine, this experience has shaken that

belief somewhat.  In fact, it has almost devastated our lives.  Not only

did we move all our belongings there (at our own expense), established a

residence, etc., but the hospital reported her to the State Nursing Board

and nobody will hire her now that she has this `record'.  After 20 years of

experience and higher education (with absolutely NO drug abuse), she gets

this for eating two supermarket muffins for breakfast.  The scary thig is

that this could happen to anyone\ldots .



Thanks VERY MUCH in advance for all your help!

Subject: Poppy Seed Update \#1

Sender: Drug Abuse Education Information and Research 



Hello Everyone,



I'm the source of last week's poppy seed disaster story - and I'm

finally back for the long haul.  Being somewhat concerned that our

situation might be viewed as cluttering up your LISTSERV discussions, I was

happily surprised to see your many wonderful responses from the last week

or so.  Thank you very much for all your help and the offers of continuing

interest and support.  As a number of you have said, this situation is an

education for all of us - and an opportunity to somehow prevent others from

encountering a similar fate.  I can assure you that we are committed to

seeing this thing through, not only to clear Laurie's name, but to change

the laws or at least to educate everyone as best we can.  This is my first

update of what we've found out so far, in case it can be helpful to anyone

else.  If this isn't appropriate for the whole LIST, please let me know and

I will mail these updates only to those who express an interest\ldots .



First, my apologies for the delay at getting back to all of you, but

Laurie's sister got married this past weekend and we were back East to

attend the wedding, make plans, etc.  She is holding up pretty well, but

you can tell she still feels quite devastated by the entire unbelievable

situation.  Laurie wanted me to thank you and she is following up on

much of the information and suggestions that you've sent me so far.  She

doesn't have an Internet connection, but we are working on getting her one

so she can listen in and reply to you directly.  The latest situation is

this, as best as we can understand it:



The hospital that `fired' her because of this one test result is a private

business; the lawyers tell us that there is not much we can do through the

courts because, as a private concern, the hospital can do what they want as

long as they don't discriminate on the basis of sex, race, religion, etc.

If it was a public institution, she would have different rights.  That's

lesson number one for anyone looking for employment or anyone in Congress

who really wants to make a difference.  As an aside, we were pretty

discouraged at first because almost every major law firm in the city seemed

to be on retainer for this place; they quickly stated a `conflict of

interest' to our inquiries and nervously hung up.  It made us feel pretty

small and helpless\ldots .



The State Nursing Board is public, and so far they have returned some phone

calls, but have not given us much information about how long it will take

for them to give Laurie a chance to state her case (and the TRUTH).  So the

lawyer has dispatched a letter to hasten this process, since nobody will

hire her while she is being `investigated'.  Meanwhile, we are hoping that

the hospital will give us the full lab test results, since they may help

show the truth; the hospital only reported the morphine levels to the

Nursing Board, not the other data needed to put them in perspective.  We

would like to get Laurie's specimens sent to a lab whose analysis

carries some weight, if we can just get them to talk to us (its now been

almost three weeks).  DOES ANYONE OUT THERE KNOW OF A LAB WHICH HAS AN

UNDISPUTED REPUTATION IN DRUG TESTING ANALYSIS AND ALSO HAS AN EXPERTISE IN

DIFFERENTIATING POPPY SEEDS FROM REAL MORPHINE ABUSE???  That would be a

perfect solution to this mess, if such a thing exists\ldots .



A number of you have suggested the ACLU, the press, etc.  We are developing

a letter to the ACLU (they must be overwhelmed since we always get the

answering machine and they haven't return our calls).  Whatever happens

with the legal system, we may eventually talk to anyone in the press

who will listen; people have to be educated about the dangers of drug

testing, especially if the government is unwilling to help protect innocent

people.  We are gathering suggestions here, but we are not going to push it

until we've done our best to gather the facts and the support of any

experts who will help out.



One Nursing Association has asked Laurie for her suggestions of what the

proper drug testing procedure should be.  Its a start; any professional

organization willing to listen (and perhaps eventually lend their support)

is very welcome indeed!  ANY SUGGESTIONS OUT THERE ON PROPER PROCEDURES?

Laurie has confirmed that the hospital did NOT warn her of the foods not to

take (in advance of the test) and they did NOT even ask her what foods she

had taken the past 48 hours (when she took the test).  Many organizations

seem to do this as standard procedure.  A number of doctors have said the

recommended procedure on a positive morphine reading is to confirm the

findings only after a positive check for needle marks, eye color, etc.; the

hospital didn't do that either.  What can one person do when an

organization uses these drug tests as THE ONLY proof, and doesn't follow

all the other recommended procedures?  I guess you take your lumps like

Laurie and so many others have.  (Lesson numer two for those seeking

employment).



A number of you have also asked if they did a GC/MS test once the EMIT gave

a positive reading, and you've asked what procedures were used.  We have no

idea since nobody's talking at the hospital; we can't even find out which

labs did the testing.  Its tough to prove the truth when the data is

unavailable\ldots .  (Lesson number three for anyone who has the power to

change the current status-quo).



Yes, the DOD did raise their morphine limit to 4000 from the suggested NIDA

levels because of their research on poppy seeds (that was published).

Laurie just talked to them and they've brought it down to 300 again

(we don't know exactly why; they may think they are missing some legitimate

drug abusers).  Someone at the DOT said that they don't even ask questions

until you hit 2,000 (has this changed?).  They said something like `we

don't want to catch bagel-eaters; we want to catch drug abusers'.  If this

is true, it appears we may have working pilots with readings near 2,000

while other people have lost their jobs over limits far below that level.

This is NOT a complaint, just an observation.  But if this is true, the DOT

should be commended for a much more intelligent approach to drug testing

than other offices in the same federal government.  CAN ANYONE DIRECT ME TO

INFORMATION ON JUST HOW NIDA ARRIVED AT ITS LEVEL OF 300 AS A LEGITIMATE

INDICATOR OF MORPHINE DRUG ABUSE???  We've also learned that American poppy

seeds are much LESS potent that pacific-variety poppy seeds.  You

guessed it - the stores have confirmed that Laurie's muffins had poppy

seeds from Australia.  Did these contain much higher levels of opiates than

the variety that NIDA used to arrive at their levels?  We don't know.  CAN

ANYONE AT NIDA HELP US OUT ON THIS?



We've learned that several legislators may be pursuing a solution to these

problems.  Dingle from Michigan has done something, but his office doesn't

return Laurie's phone calls.  We've just found out that Hatch from Utah and

Boren from Oklahoma are working on something, but we don't know exactly

what.  A state legislator from Arizona actually personally called Laurie

and wanted all the facts we could give them.  We were really impressed by

that.  It is another reason why we are honestly trying to pursue the REAL

truth and find all the facts we can BEFORE we go public.  We are not

interested in being trouble-makers; we just want all people to be treated

fairly.  So we'll take any suggestions, off-the-record, from anyone who

feels in any kind of danger helping us out.



Finally, we don't really know yet, because we lack so many `facts', WHAT or

WHO is responsible for Laurie's misfortune.  It could be the Feds, the

State of Arizona, the Board of Nursing, the hospital, their insurance

company, their employee health doctor, the Director of Nursing, the human

resources department, all of them, and/or all of us.  Its interesting

that the doctor refused to acknowledge that poppy seeds could have ANY

effect until Laurie gave him some articles.  But that 300 is an absolute to

him; that's as much as he will consider, no matter what.  His mind is like

a brick wall.  The Director of Nursing has recently been devastated by a

close friend and associate whose life suffered greatly because of her

hidden drug abuse; in the Director's eyes, that 300 is also quite

absolute - Laurie may always be guilty no matter what we finally prove to

be true (God himself would have trouble convincing her).



You would also think a nurse would know about the foods which give positive

drug readings, and I was very surprised Laurie did NOT know.  We've since

found (unofficially, by an informal poll) that MOST nurses don't know.

Laurie specializes in critical care, and has seen her share of overdoses,

but never one from poppy seeds.  And I would wager that is true for an even

greater percent of the general population.  We do watch some news and read

the paper, but we can't remember ever coming across a similar story.

Neither one of us has ever taken a drug test in our lives and never gave

this one a second thought because we've been `good'.  Now we feel like the

innocent people who are given these tests are like cattle being led to

slaughter - without intelligent laws, reasonable guidelines, or some type

of education, improper (or misinterpreted) procedures have the potential of

ruining lives everywhere.  But you folks already know that; I've learned

from your email that you've been at this awhile.  I hope that one or two

items from this looonnggg note might be helpful to someone and/or the whole

field of study.  I promise a much shorter note next time\ldots .



Best wishes,



John

=========================================================================



Date: Dec 1993

From: `John J. Gibson' 

Subject: Poppy Seed Update \#2

Sender: Drug Abuse Education Information and Research 



Hello Everyone,



Many of you asked us to keep you informed after the `poppy seed

disaster story' several months ago; its time for the next

installment, and we have finally have some good news to report.  In

a nutshell, an incredible series of events has culminated in the

State Nursing Board COMPLETELY dismissing the charges on Laura's

record.  They have acknowledged that there was absolutely no proof

that she was a morphine abuser and that the test readings were

indeed possibly due to those poppy seed muffins bought at the local

supermarket\ldots .



We would like to thank all of you again for the many leads,

articles, referrals, suggestions, good wishes, opinions, etc.  The

Internet community came through, and your feedback helped more than

you can know.  Laura now has a huge stack of research and other

information which most definitely helped to speed her case, and may

someday help to advance appropriate legislation, educate the

public, and/or save someone else in a similar career-threatening

situation.



In case any of you run across a similar situation again, Laura's

experiences may prove helpful (and from what we've heard, she might

be one of the lucky ones).  In the end, it was an interview with a

psychiatrist that eventually helped to break the case; as you will

see, it was necessary for Laura to carefully check several of these

doctors - a good one was not so easily found.  The Board had told

Laura that it would be 6 to 8 months before they would get to her

case, due to the massive backlog of other cases.  They also

mentioned that they could require a `psychological assessment' when

they finally considered her story.  However, after hearing this

story over the phone, a doctor at the recommended hospital insisted

on enrolling Laura in a \$4,500 program (three days long) and made

a number of disturbing statements like `you'd better not lie or I

will have to punish you.'  Thinking that this might be the only

type of recourse to get her license back, Laura was devastated by

the conversation; she was obviously already being considered by the

medical community as `guilty until proven innocent.'  A neighbor

suggested that she call other psychiatrists, and she eventually

scheduled an interview and random drug testing with one whom (she

later found out) just happened to have a good reputation with the

Board.  She really knew very little about this psychiatrist (there

were no referrals); but he recognized the truth and called the

Board after the initial session.  The Board immediately made

Laura's case a high priority and an investigator met her two days

later; Laura's stack of research and contacts was by that time

complete enough to help establish her innocence, and the rest is

history\ldots .



There are many other interesting side-stories to this case.  For

example, the Board had also called a toxicologist whom they

frequently used on such cases, and he just happened to have

attended a meeting where a number of these toxicologists

experimented on themselves by eating poppy seed bagels; most of the

group then tested over the 2,000 level for morphine (remember that

Laura's reported level was 1,017).  Also, after much prodding, the

hospital finally gave Laura the results of the EMIT (which shows

only an approximate positive/negative reading).  They said they had

to order the GC/MS report from the lab again because they `only had

a phone report.'  After much more prodding, we finally got a copy

of this report in mid-November; it turns out that the 1017 level

reported to State Boards was not accurate, since this second report

was over 1,400.  We still wonder if this second test was really

done in August or if it was really completed more recently to

satisfy our requests.  In the final analysis, however, this didn't

matter.  Experts all over the country confirmed that levels over

1,000 could come from poppy seeds alone, especially Australian and

several other varieties (it is interesting to note here that the

supermarket acknowledged these particular poppy seeds came from

Australia; we've also learned that these potent seeds may have

originally been genetically bred for morphine production).  The

hospital also refuses to give us the history of handling, and they

had not recorded any of the data taken on Laura's level of

dehydration at the time of the test.



Next, as far as we can tell, the hospital's Occupational Health

doctor (whose analysis everyone respected) did not follow official

federal government guidelines when considering the test data.  In

fact, the AMA, ASAM, and AAMRO all recommend following these

guidelines, but private organizations are NOT required to do so.

This doctor did not try to find out if Laura's 1,000+ level was

possible from poppy seeds; the 300 level used by the EMIT was all

that mattered to him - IT was the final word.  Official guidelines

say that the initial test results should be recognized as just one

indicator in many, that one must consider the whole picture: a

physical, second lab tests, and other clinical signs of abuse

should also be used in the analysis.  We're not even sure if this

doctor had the education to know what guidelines exist to make

`accurate' judgements.  We just know that his abrupt judgement in

this case caused the loss of a job and almost destroyed an entire

career.  And we are told that private institutions, such as this

hospital, can continue to do these tests in whatever manner they

please; there are no laws to protect the innocent in drug testing.



More on guidelines: The Reagan Administration first required that

federal agencies establish drug detection programs - and that they

follow federal guidelines on the analysis of the results.  The

administration also suggested that private organizations establish

similar programs because of potential losses due to drug abuse.

Unfortunately, for some reason, these private organizations were

NOT required to also follow the accompanying guidelines.  We've

received a broad range of opinions on the pros and cons of drug

testing itself.  Whatever you believe, it seems obvious to us that

if drug testing is going to be with us for a while, EVERY

organization should be REQUIRED to follow some type of intelligent

set of guidelines or regulations if they use drug testing

procedures.  In fact, urinalysis might better be utilized as

confirmation of a positive reading in `impairment testing,' since

urine drug tests do not necessarily reveal the level of a person's

impairment on the job, etc.  You may be interested in a recent

`Viewpoint' guest editorial on impairment testing published in the

New York Times, Sunday, November 28, section F-11.  As an aside,

we've heard that many of the same organizations who have stiff drug

testing programs do not test for perhaps the largest abuse problem

of all - alcohol; is this true?



Now that Laura has her Nursing License back, a few of you are bound

to ask `what happened with the hospital?'  We called the hospital

shortly after the Nursing Board's decision and found that the Board

had already informed them that Laura's record was cleared of all

charges.  When asked what they thought about this, the hospital

replied `this just proves that the system works.'  Amazing.  There

doesn't seem to be any recognition of what this event has done to

our lives and that it could easily have been prevented (one way the

system SHOULD work).  In fact, the hospital also mentioned that

they feel they did most everything right.  Their view now is that

poppy seeds may have indeed been the cause of Laura's positive test

results, but that nothing can really prove that morphine wasn't the

true cause.  Laura will always be `guilty until proven innocent' at

this hospital.  And what about her job?  Since early September,

they have advertised that position in the newspapers - and even on

the Internet.  However, it has recently been canceled as a cost-

saving measure.  After all the hospital's time and expense of

nationally recruiting for this position over the past year, we

can't help but wonder if there is another story we don't yet know

about\ldots .



There is another side to this situation, and in all fairness to the

hospital, they may be correct about inconclusive lab testing in

poppy seed cases.  Unlike food combinations that cause positive

results on the EMIT (which can later be proven false by the GC/MS),

there is much disagreement about the ability of any test to show

the difference between eating poppy seeds and using morphine.  The

BEST policy may be to just WARN people, well in advance, to steer

clear of poppy seeds before drug testing.  We've heard that WalMart

gives their people a list of substances to avoid before such drug

tests are taken.  If only the hospital had done that too!  And as

far as we can tell, none of the other hospitals in the area do this

either.  The hospital says a committee is now studying changing

their policy to warn people about poppy seeds before testing.  They

also say they may require testing to be done before a job offer is

extended and families move their entire household to town (as in

our case).  Great idea, folks!  Its interesting to note that the

hospital said it can't understand why this same misfortune happens

to such a high percentage of out-of-state nurses.  Perhaps they are

finally seeing the light.  We wonder, however, if they really care

enough to follow through with their plans - to do so would

certainly be a step in the right direction.



Many people have encouraged us to initiate lawsuits against the

doctor, the hospital, the state, etc.  The logic goes something

like `not only could a lawsuit reimburse you for damages, but it

could initiate changes in the law to protect others from the same

fate.'  This sounds great to us and we would love to proceed.  It

is easy to see the doctor/hospital rationale; the reason for suing

the state would be to encourage an early initial hearing (e.g. a

few days) for those who are forced to put their livelihoods `on

hold' while the Nursing Board sifts through 6 to 8 months of other

cases (in Colorado, for example, you have that right if your

driver's license is suspended and you have to wait a long time

before your case goes to court).  Unfortunately, we've discovered

a number of problems in proceeding with a lawsuit.  Laura has

talked to dozens of lawyers; most refuse to touch the case and the

few others recommend against it.  Many of the major law firms are

already on retainer for the hospital; that's conflict of interest.

The other firms say that it will be a long, slow, expensive,

painful, and eventually fruitless process.  Since drug-testing

sentiment is running high in Arizona (so close to the border),

almost any jury would agree with the view that `the chance of

losing a few innocent people is much better for the public good

than the risk of hiring a drug abuser into the hospital

environment.'  In the end, we would damage the cause and help prove

the hospital acted in the correct manner.  Again, `this just proves

that the system works.'



We've also been told that its too risky a case for lawyers with

political ambitions because it makes them extremely nervous to

handle a cause so contrary to public opinion.  This might also

explain why the drug testing bills before Congress (which would

correct some of the loopholes) haven't been passed.  Furthermore,

most of the real damage can't be measured.  And the legal folks say

that Laura did too good a job of mitigating our damages for the

things that CAN be measured.  Since our financial losses will

probably `only' be \$15,000 or so, no competent lawyer would look at

this volatile case for such a `small sum of money' (we couldn't

afford to pay them anyway - that was all our savings and the down

payment for a house).  Its been suggested that we find someone on

the national scene who is outraged by this situation, who has the

financial resources to proceed, and who does not have political

ambitions.  As of yet, we have not found anyone like this with the

appropriate expertise.  We've also tried a number of `cause-based'

organizations with no success; however, they do wish us luck.  The

state ACLU has not returned our calls (and is rumored to be almost

bankrupt); the national ACLU told us to talk to the state.  So we

will probably send the state ACLU a report through the mail before

we finally give up on them.  IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS - OR NAMES -

THAT COULD HELP HERE, PLEASE LET US KNOW.  We still hope that

justice will somehow be served - for everyone's sake.



So what's next, you say?  Laura is now writing a number of articles

for submission to journals in the hope that she can educate

professionals that her situation IS indeed possible.  Once this

research is completed, we may also try popular media like NPR, 60

minutes, the Wall Street Journal, etc. hoping to educate the

working public that this could also happen to them.  Since private

organizations aren't required to protect people from these types of

errors, people will probably have to look out for themselves.  If

we do take this approach, a lawyer friend has warned us to `report

only the facts, not your opinions' and to use a quality program so

we don't get sued over the report.  Its a frustrating situation; we

don't have much left.  But our friend has also made another

observation - we were really lucky when you think about it.

Somehow we were fortunate to connect with the right advice, sources

of information, expertise, etc., and Laura was skilled (from her

recent Master's program) in doing the needed research.  We also had

a supportive network of friends whose spirit helped us to continue.

And we are now somewhat free to seek a new dream.  Others may not

be so fortunate in a similar situation.  So the challenge remains

to somehow correct the system\ldots .



And that's about it for now.  We promised last time not to make

this next update too long, but we've done it again.  We hope it

will be valuable to someone out there.  Until the next update, we

will be trying to put our lives back together again - Laura is

still in Arizona but is looking nationwide for a job, John

(fortunately) is still making a living in Colorado, and we will

have to see where we end up.  As promised, we aren't done yet; we

will share our story with almost anyone who will listen.  You'll

hear from us again, if you would like to.  As always, if you have

any other ideas or thoughts, please let us know; we would love to

hear from you.  And thanks VERY MUCH again for everything!



Best Wishes,



John \& Laura
