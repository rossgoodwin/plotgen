 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# 



A bit of history first. I am currently twenty and have been irregularly smoking pot on and off since I was 15 and became interested in other substances when I graduated high school. I am currently about to turn twenty and become a junior in college with a 3.3 GPA and full scholarship. I have never overdosed on any drug, but I've had many positive and negative experiences with various drugs through the years. 



I frequently smoke pot but have grown tired of it in recent months and looked for alternatives. I have had a lot of experience with prescription opiates, primarily oxycontin and hydrocodone, but I have also done a fair amount of cocaine during one period of my life, ecstasy, mushrooms, 1 intense acid trip, several unimpressive salvia experiences, adderall, and many other prescription pills I've come across along the way. I no longer indulge myself in drugs as I did at one point in my life; as I have matured I have discovered my equilibrium and try to be safe and as responsible as possible with what I do take. 



The only drugs I currently take and have in the last year are herbals things, pot, and opiates a few times a month and never overdo it in fear that I may once again awaken that devil, and very occasionally amphetamines for school; though I despise the feeling, they can be extremely effective for paper righting and intensive research work. Apart from that I've recently begun researching and experimenting with herbal alternatives and have currently tried kratom, blue lotus, salvia, wormwood(smoked), Calea zacatechichi (smoked), and I have an oz of sinicuichi which I have not yet found to time to try and I am partially reluctant due to the soreness that many people report. 



I have been working as a roofer in addition to attending school for a year and I am in quite good physical shape. Kratom is also the most effective herbal plant I've run across that provides a good high, while still being legal.

	

I have now had 4 experiences with kratom; my most recent being the most effective with the strongest and desired results. The first time I purchase and oz of ``premium commercial grade fine grind'' kratom from a reputable online vendor for merely \$12.00 including shipping. Other than a few attempts to smoke kratom with very little results, my initial experience involved drinking the dust in a cup of water which was very difficult and made me severely gag, but I managed to get it down. I had noticeable effects to my surprise, but I didn't feel anything too much like opiates, more of a weak body high and slight stimulant. 



The second time I used about 11-12 grams and made some tea, which I split with a friend of mine. Upon further research I don't think I made this batch of tea properly as I did not combine my extractions, but drank them independently. I had less of an effect than the first time. The third time I packed the last bit of powder I had, which was 5 or 6 grams into 7 or 8 capsules and had the same weak feeling I did the first time. By this time I had come to the conclusion that kratom is definitely worth while, but I need to experiment with it more. I got online and ordered another ounce from the same vendor, but instead of premium commercial grade it was advertised as ``private growers personal crop, excellent quality'' and I took that for whatever it was worth and received it in the mail 3 days later. It looked much different than the commercial grade as it was crunched up dried leafs with some veins still intact; it was also more aromatic than the first oz I purchase, so I definitely know it was different than the first stuff I had.



 Today I decided would be a good day to try a higher dose and make the tea properly, and so I did. Since I had tried 5 gram doses with mild results I figured it would be safe to double it to 10g considering I've read many reports of much higher doses being ingested. I measured out about 10g and crushed it up much finer in my makeshift mortar and pestle.  I began by putting 2 cups of water in a small pot and bringing it to a boil. Once my water was boiling I stirred in my leaves and decreased the heat to about 6 on my stove to keep a consistent boil but not so much to bubble over or burn my kratom on the sides or bottom. I let this boil, stirring occasionally for about twenty minutes and then strained this first extraction into a cup through a regular paper coffee filter. The resulting liquid was a nasty looking dark greenish brown color with a pungent odor. 

	

I then proceeded to my second extraction with the same kratom the same way but used about 1 and 1$\backslash$2 cups of water let it boil for about 15 minutes this time. The resulting solution was slightly lighter and more translucent than the original one, but still seemed quite potent. This time I made more of an effort to squeeze all of the liquid out of the kratom before beginning my 3rd and final extraction. This last extraction I only used half a cup of water because I realized my cup was getting full and I didn't want to have to consume a lot of this nasty liquid. I let it boil for 10 or 15 minutes and strained in, but this time the resulting liquid was almost clear with a hint of greenish yellow, which I have come to believe that a 3rd extraction is probably unnecessary. Once the extraction process was completed I searched my kitchen for something to mask the taste of this foul liquid and discovered some chai black spice tea that I purchased several months prior. I poured all of the liquid I had into a clean pot and boiled in the chai tea and some of the volume out. I was left with probably about 3 and ½ cups of liquid which I let cool for a few minutes before trying. 



I also want to note that kratom tea is easier to drink when warm rather than cold, but it may just be preferential. The completed tea was very dark brown and murky with some oily residue apparent in the solution. I tasted it and to my surprise it was quite a pleasant taste this time and rather sweet with a hint of bitterness. The chai spice tea hid the kratom flavor much more effectively than I thought. I drank the solution over a 5 to 10 minute time span and then immediately drove to my 1:30 class hoping that the effects would hit me while I was sitting in class. My results were written down over the hour and fifteen minutes I was in class and then my current feeling. 



1:10 p.m. 

Completed drinking my 10g kratom tea and proceed to drive to class. I feel happy and somewhat loose, probably just a placebo effect.



1:26 p.m

 I began handwriting my experience before class starts and do not really feel anything yet.



1:54 p.m. 

I feel something slowly come on and it is much more pronounced than it was 15 minutes ago, but it's pretty mild and I know I have not entered the full blown effects. My body feels very light weight but my mental state seems pretty well intact. I'm sure I could drive right now with no problem. I feel vague traces of the first onset of an opiate high, but it again may just be my mind.



2:00 p.m. 

I've noticed I've yawned 3 times since ingestion, but I am not tired. I have a similar thing from opiates but instead of yawning, my eyes shut on me again my will until I force them open or the wave passes. It also reminds me of the later effects of smoking blue lotus foliage.



2:04 p.m.

I'm feeling more floaty as time progressing. My body isn't unresponsively numb but it feels well. Very calm and relaxed, but still not feeling anything really strong.



2:08 p.m.

Mental clarity seems to be decreasing slightly, but not as strongly as when I am on opiates. I have a feeling of wellbeing, but unlike opiates I am not experiencing the apathy and nonchalant behavior I frequently get from OCs.



2:12 p.m. 

Continuous yawning, but still not tired, I am certain this is a symptom telling me I am coming up into the full effects of the drug. I cannot control yawning and it seems to happen fairly frequently and uncontrollably, but I feel perfectly fine.



2:19 p.m.

Time perception is definitely slowed now. I am very lightweight feeling throughout my head and limbs. This is different from opiates as well as they tend to give me a heavy feeling in my forehead and eyes. I am much more alert than I would be if I snorted some OC and my mental state is less interested in the lecture, but still fairly clear. Strong positive mental state; I am in a good mood and only sitting in class, no reason to feel good right now, I just do.



2:30 p.m.

I think I am now entering the peak 1 hour and twenty minutes since consumption. My body feels very good and my mind is getting much more drifty.



2:36 p.m.

I am embraced by a cozy and comfortable feeling and feeling very relaxed. This is the feeling I desired and did not experience at a lower dose. I enjoy the way I am currently feeling and hope it lasts and gets slightly stronger. I also like how it seems to leave my mental state much more normal than opiates, which make me pretty inactive. I notice it has a similar wave-like effect and that the feeling will spike and then slightly decrease and then spike again.



4:07 pm(now)

I left class and had no problems driving, but I am feeling this quite strongly. It has been almost three hours since ingestion and the last hour and a half have been quite nice. This is definitely my most successful and pleasing experience with kratom and I now see the true value of this herb. I am still feeling quite strong effects from it that have not decreased in some time. I have not had the slightest hint of nausea. Eating the powder induced slight nausea, but tea seems to be a much more effective method when made properly.
