About a week ago, I experienced what is probably the craziest, most hectic night I've ever had.  It was my friend, Mary's, 18th birthday, so my friend, Dave, and I decided to throw a party for her. I picked up Mary around 4pm and took her to get her navel pierced. After Mary got her piercing, when went to the mall to get food, and then to Dave's apartment.



We arrive at Dave's apartment to find about eight of our friends there hanging out. It was about 8pm when the party really began.



T + 0:00



We start the night off by smoking some DMT. I had a half a gram of DMT, which came out to about ten doses. I purchased a glass ball freebase pipe to use with the DMT so I could properly vaporize it. I dumped 50mg into the pipe. I intended to take three hits but as soon as I exhaled the first hit, I decided one was enough for my first time. I handed the pipe to one of my friends and laid back on my friend's bed. I instantly felt the most euphoric I've ever felt. My body felt completely blissful, this was the best physical sensation I've ever felt. There was about seven of my friends standing around me watching me and laughing. The walls and doors behind them began to bend and breathe. Colors became extremely vibrant, almost to the point it was overwhelming. I close my eyes and saw a huge striped wall. In front of the wall were two giant blobs of goo that were morphing and spinning around each other. Eventually I opened my eyes and gradually returned to reality.



T + 0:07



Five other people at the party tried the DMT as well, but Mary said she wanted to wait until later in the night. Mary wanted to start the night off with a roll. I weighed out 0.3g of methylone for Mary, gave it to her, and she swallowed it. I then also ate 0.3g of methylone. After the others finished with the DMT, they also ate some methylone.



For the next two hours, we listened to music, played beer pong, and hung out together.



T + 2:00



I just remembered I had a sheet of blotters with 1000 micrograms of 25c-NBOMe on each tab. Jokingly, I said to Mary, `So are you trying to eat some NBOMe or what?' Surprisingly she was eager to eat some, and it was her birthday, so I wasn't going to stop her from doing what she wanted to do. When everyone else realized what she was taking, about six other people wanted to take some too. Mary took two tabs, and everyone else took one, including me. 



T + 3:00



I'm rolling pretty hard, but not tripping very hard. I take three shots of Patron. Mary and another one of my friends each roll a blunt. We go outside and smoke the blunts. When I come back in, I'm pretty fucked up but still not tripping very hard. Mary tells me she's seeing trails and tripping very hard. She asks me to take more NBOMe so I will be on the same level as her. Wanting to please the birthday girl, I agree. I take one more tab. Then I eat another 0.3 grams of methylone. Mary snorts a few lines of methylone.



T + 4:00



Now I'm tripping hard. I am really fucked up. I can barely function normally. I start to notice Mary is saying some slightly weird things and acting a little strange. I figured she was just really fucked up and didn't think much of it.



T + 5:00



Mary's behavior is gradually becoming stranger and more erratic. She is very hyper and can't seem to stay in one room for more than five minutes. Everyone was wondering why she was acting a little weird, but her behavior wasn't crazy enough for anyone to speak up about it.



T + 6:00



There is now clearly something wrong with Mary. She is running around the apartment, room to room, being very loud and hyper. Her behavior gradually becomes even more erratic. She took off her shirt and was running through the apartment in her bra. She is yelling, laughing, and making sex noises. All the movement caused her navel piercing to bleed several times. Each time she would notice it was bleeding, she'd start crying but kept running around. In hindsight, I realize how terrible of an idea this was but I then asked Mary if she wanted to smoke her DMT yet. She agreed and smoked 50mg. It only made her act crazier. I tried to explain to Dave that I had never seen her like this before. I was embarrassed because Dave didn't know Mary before the party. I asked to have the party at Dave's and he agreed even though he didn't know Mary.



T + 7:30



Mary is running up to guys and making sex noises, latching on to them and humping. A couple who lives in the apartment comes out of their room after being woken up by all the commotion. At this point, Mary loses her bra too and is running around topless. The owners of the apartment then told me we had to leave. They said they were sorry but couldn't have her making so much noise and commotion so late at night in their apartment complex. One of the guys who was at the apartment took Mary and told me to come over to his place across the street. He left with Mary and I soon followed in my car with his girlfriend. I get to his apartment, which is empty because he's about to move. Mary is still freaking out and demands we take her back to the other apartment.



T + 8:00



Mary asks me for some water, so I pour her a glass. As soon as I give it to her, she throws it across the room at the wall. She's now making me very angry. I try very hard to not yell at her angrily. I ask her why she threw the water and she punches me in the chest and runs out of the room. She tries to run outside but I stop her. She then runs up to me, grabs me, and begins making out with me. As soon as she starts she stops and runs out of the room. She runs out of the apartment and up the stairs outside. She tries getting into an apartment, thinking it was the one we were in earlier but it actually belonged to someone we did not know. I get her back inside and try to keep her calm.



T + 9:00



Dave gets her to lay down on his bed and watch TV. She still appears agitated but has finally calmed down.



T + 10:00



She begins asking me about certain things she did during the night. She seems confused as to why she did what she did. Gradually, she remembers bit by bit what occurred that night. She becomes extremely embarrassed and apologetic when she remembers how she was acting. Neither of us knew exactly what caused her to act that way. I did the same amount of drugs she did, but I suppose with a drug cocktail like we had, it wouldn't be too hard to become psychotic.



This is by far the craziest night I've ever had and I'll never forget it.
