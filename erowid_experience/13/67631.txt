It was a long and boring weekend in which I had a few extra days off work. The only drug I had been taking for months was methcathinone. I felt that taking a downer to pass some time might be fun. I had quit smoking weed many months ago and I dislike alcohol a great deal. What other drugs may be around? After reading a few reports on the nutmeg experience, I search the house. An ancient bottle of nutmeg turns up. This bottle was at least five years old, probably older. The last time I saw it, I also was trying to achieve some psychoactive effect from it, although I failed. From what I know of chemistry, my assumption is that it does not matter how old the nutmeg is because the psychoactive chemicals are very stable and unlikely to deteriorate with time.



So I mix 5 grams of nutmeg with a cup of water and down the crap. It didn't taste good but was bearable. After waiting 1-2 hours, I start to feel a mild and very unpronounced sedative effect. I feel that this is not strong enough and down another 5 grams. 1-2 hours later the effect is now reasonably noticeable. My motor skills seem to be affected slightly but I am not experiencing anything special. I take another 5 grams and 1-2 hours later I am fairly out of it.



At this point I am high, but I am not any more impaired than if I had smoked a few bowls of hydro. I was watching TV during the 5-6 hours of nutmeg dosing. I got a strange marijuana like vibe in that certain things I was watching were bringing me down or that they had some special relevance to me. In retrospect, nothing I watched probably had any real relevance to me. It seemed like barriers to communicate were lowered and I spent a little while talking to one of my family members. In reality, my ability to think and communicate were slightly impaired and I found myself unable to articulately express what I thought. I eventually returned to my room, bouncing between the internet and TV.



It wasn't until about 9 hours after the beginning of nutmeg dosing that my high had plateaued. Up until then, I felt as if I was slowly getting higher. The high was really nothing special at all. It lacked the finer things which cannabis provided and it was even less enjoyable than alcohol. It was a very blah, blunt, and dull kind of feeling. Even the feeling of the drug itself was nothing special. I was very much in control of myself and had no trouble doing anything which I wanted to do. I was hoping for a hallucinogenic effect but this did not happen. At times my vision became very blurry though. At some point, I felt as if I had a bunch of small headaches going on in the right side of my head. I took 200 mg of ibuprofen which relieved it for the most part. One more thing is that it put me a very repetitive manner. I was repeating things many times and kept thinking the same thoughts such as `I've seen this before' and `This was on yesterday'.



A couple hours before the high had plateaued, I began thinking that since this was not providing the hallucinogenic experience I had hoped for, I may be able to get that experience by adding some diphenhydramine. I had never tripped off of this before, it had only made me go to sleep, but I figured that the drug combination may make it possible. When I hit the plateau of the nutmeg at the 9 hour mark, I took 100mg of diphenhydramine and also another 200mg of ibuprofen for headaches.



About an hour later, the stuff hits me and I am stupefied but only borderline tripping at most. One thing that stood out was a very realistic hallucination I had when I looked at my caller ID. It looked as if waves were going through the display. This was very similar to what happens when a LCD display is pressed down. Any other hallucinations or distortions I had were quite minor. About an hour after the diphenhydramine had kicked in, I felt that I was able to keep myself awake and could handle another 50mg. I was wrong about that actually. After the extra 50mg kicked in, I was basically unable to do anything except lay on my couch with my eyes closed. At that point I decided it was best to just go to sleep.



I slept for approximately 8 hours. I could still feel some residual effect of the nutmeg when I woke up. I was groggy but didn't feel too impaired. I felt that it might be fun to try and really trip that night by taking even more of the drugs. I knew that I would have to take something to keep me awake. I made 4 cups of coffee. Almost exactly 24 hours after I first started dosing on nutmeg, I took around 6 grams of nutmeg, drank the coffee, and waited for the high to kick in. When it did, I felt like shit and decided not to take any more nutmeg or diphenhydramine. The `meg masked the effects of the coffee. I really wasn't stimulated at all, just groggy and out of it. Around this time, I had a bizarre vision of myself in the future in which I looked like complete shit from all the drugs. It kinda freaked me out which was another reason I didn't want to take any more nutmeg.



At this point, this nutmeg thing was just annoying. I wanted it to go away but that was just not going to happen. I tried to carry on normally as if I hadn't taken anything for a few hours. The coffee wore off but the `meg just kept going on. The nutmeg was even more annoying after the coffee was gone.



About 8.5 hours after dosing on the nutmeg, I decided that to combat the nutmeg, I needed take something more hardcore than coffee. So I downed a dose of methcathinone along the lines of 150-200mg. This was something the nutmeg was unable to mask. I must also say that this was the first time in about 34 hours which I felt 'good'. When I was first coming up, my thoughts were racing. I was having lots of random thoughts which were making me laugh out loud. I wrote a bit about my experience so far. Things were good for about 4-5 hours, after which, the stimulant effect of the methcathinone faded. At this point, I was physically unable to do anything although my thoughts were racing still. At this point I had to sleep. Something that I have noticed about methcathinone is that it makes me dream. That night I had many dreams which were oddly relevant to some of my real life situations. I'm not sure if the nutmeg may have contributed to my dreams.



When I woke up I felt very groggy but it was like the nutmeg wasn't really affecting me anymore. I was wrong about that actually. It wasn't until I went to work later that day that I noticed my motor skills and thought process were still fairly impaired. Two hours before work I took about 150-200mg of methcathinone because I was still feeling shitty from the nutmeg. One hour before work I added another 125-175mg of methcathinone to get where I really wanted to be. Once at work, I was quite high and still coming up. But the residual effects of the nutmeg were clashing with the methcathinone. My movements were quick, yet were choppy, blunt, and hindered. My thoughts were racing but my focus was completely shot. I could not think anything through, I could only think of part of something and quickly move on to the next thing.



I get off work about 36 hours after last dosing on nutmeg. On the ride home I notice that my entire head hurts. I have a headache confined mostly to the right side of my head, my jaw hurts probably because I was clenching my teeth, and I don't even know why other parts of my head hurt. My eyes are very dilated when the light is dim. When I get home I take more ibuprofen for the head aches and write more about my ordeal. I was still fairly stimulated a good 5 hours after taking the methcathinone. I was thankful for every increment that the nutmeg faded. I was also thankful that I had some MCAT to help me through that terrible and difficult experience. About 48 hours after last dosing on the nutmeg, I felt that the effects from the 'meg were almost nearly completely gone.



Something that I took from this experience is that nutmeg and diphenhydramine are not worth taking recreationally. The amount of these drugs which it takes to hallucinate comes with some heavy baggage. Hallucination is not the primary effect of these drugs (unlike LSD, mushrooms, and 2C-E all of which I have taken). It is a secondary effect and the primary effects must be dealt with long before hallucination occurs. Whether it be the blunt, impairing, groggy headache of nutmeg or the sleepiness of diphenhydramine, it is just not worth it. The fact that diphenhydramine is an anticholinergic intrigues me but I feel that taking a drug such as datura may be a better way to experience the anticholinergic hallucination. In fact, before I went to work, I acquired some datura seeds in response to this failed hallucination attempt. That is likely going to be my next attempt at tripping.
