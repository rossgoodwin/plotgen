I would firstly like to say that it is not my place to judge, I think that everyone on this planet has the right to undergo whatever experiences they please if it provides insight to their personality and proves to be a character building. I have been doing heroin for 6 years and during that time have been in just about every situation that could occur while living life in a drug induced wonder. I am going to list the three ways I know of to consume smack and will try to keep the factual preparation information separate from the mentality aspect of using. The first way I became aware of to use smack was snorting. In Africa we generally get Thai white/china white as opposed to brown sugar.



I was 14 when I first tried it. We would go and score 10 packets that contained about a 1/4 of a gram each for 200 South African Rands.  A quick train ride home and we would be locked in our compartment merrily snorting away. When snorting always try chop the lines on a mirror, CD cases tend to build up static and it's a real bitch to try and get your smack up your nose when it doesn't want to leave the CD case. Chop the lines with laminated cards if you have as the whole static thing also applies to charge/credit cards. The back drop from smack is probably one of the worst in the world and aggravates the bouts of nausea that novice users often feel.



The warm glow of euphoric contentment starts after about 10-15 minutes, slowly creeping up my toes until it infiltrates my brain and lulls it to ambivilence.Snorting is an effective way of doing smack as my stash lasts quite a while and I am never so out of it that I cant function. There is bound to be animosity eventually about who is chopping the lines and who is screwing who out of a line\ldots Trust me it happens. 



The second way of doing smack that I was introduced to is chasing the dragon. It's quite effective and effect are very similar to mainlining, not as instantaneous though, they usually take about 5-7 minutes to set in. A word of advice about chasing. Tear off a square of foil about the size of a pack of smokes, fold it in half and then in half again, so that when you open it out you have a piece of foil that has been divided into four. Always run the flame of a lighter over BOTH sides of the tin foil to burn off any dust or dirt that has become stuck to the foil. Next place your hit (we usually used about a 1/4 of a bag per hit) on the DULL side of the foil, always chase shiny side down as the foil can release toxic fumes when exposed to naked flame. We always used a rolled up bank note to form the cylinder between the tinfoil and your mouth, exhale all your oxygen and then light the flame under your hit.  I Inhale deeply and move the flame away from the foil before I run out of breath as the smack will keep bubbling and melting until the foil cools down. I hold the hit for as long as I can and then exhale through my nose. If you can't stand seeing your money go up in smoke then this is not the best method of consumption for you. 



The final, most dangerous and most instantaneous and powerful way of using smack is obviously mainlining. The effects are instantaneous (about  3 seconds and last for the longest up to 9 hours pending on how often you use). To mainline I use a teaspoon,

An insulin syringe, something to tie off my arm with, some surgical spirits, mineral or boiled water, a lighter, a bit of cigarette filter and a juicy vein. I Measure out a portion of smack and place it on a teaspoon, next suck up as much water as I want in the syringe, place the flame underneath it and cook it until the water boils and the smack has dissolved, roll up a bit of the cigarette filter and place it in the dissolved smack mixture, use the syringe to suck up my hit and flick the syringe with my nail until all the air has collected at the top and can be expelled from the syringe. Once I have all the air out and the mixture is flush with the needle, I select a vein and tie off my arm. Pumping my hand (balling and opening my fist) a couple of times help the veins come to the surface. Once I have selected a vein, I smack it a couple of times with my index finger until it is agitated and rises to the surface, then dab the spot of penetration with some cotton wool soaked in surgical spirit and insert the syringe, I draw back some blood (should be a dark red plume) to make sure I am in a vein and then inject the shot into my vein. Once the whole shot has been injected, I draw back some more blood for the ``flush'', this is almost cleaning the syringe out with my blood. Let the tie loose so that the blood can flow normally up my arm again. I sit back and enjoy the ride. I never use the same syringe more than twice as this will start damaging the veins. 





That's all I can share when it comes to methods of consumption, a quick word of advice for anyone who has not yet tried smack but would like to. When they say one shot and you are hooked they don't mean physically hooked straight away, but the mental addiction is almost instantaneous. Smack really is the big daddy of the narcotic world and it takes almost nothing to become addicted to the rush if that is the type of personality that you have, so if you have had trouble stopping smoking but have tried or if you cant limit your use of recreational drugs to weekends then I seriously advise that you don't try smack, or if you cant help yourself and you have to try it then smoking may be better than shooting.



Be careful and safe people, this shit is deliciously dangerous.



Take care
