This is a yarn about people getting really, really twisted. I've given my background in another report but Ill skim through again: Pot, Shrooms, Acid, Mdma, Meth, 2CB, Salvia, Nitrous, some real shitty coke. The most interesting part of this report is probably going to be the BZP, which where I come from (New Zealand) is legal and is sold under the brand names Frenzy, Euphoria and Nemi. TMFPP, which is another form of Piperazine is sold as Exodus, but there is BZP in these as well, not very helpful for serious experimenters.



The setting was at a New Years eve outdoor Dance party, and a better setting would be hard to find in my opinion. The various areas and campsites were nestled amongst tall hills, a beatiful and unspoiled natural environment. The vibes were amazing, the weather was sunny and my friends and I immediately felt welcome. This was to be my fourth time on E and my second candyflip, but I was soon to find out that the gear I'd got this time was far, far superior to those times I've just mentioned. I was filled with nervous exitement, but being among a large group of friends who I'd been tight with for ages meant that there was nothing approaching a negative thought in my mind. 



We broke out the pot in large amounts to pass the time but some of my friends were getting impatient and had heard there were some legal pills for sale that had an effect similar to speed. They went to obtain some of these while I continued to chill. The ones they got were Euphoria which I think had 50mg BZP per pill or maybe 75. Frenzy certainly have 75mg, and are stronger which makes me suspect they were 50. After being responsibly(!) informed by the supplier that they would go well with an E my friends G, P and D each took four of these pills. My other friend (P also) took two. An hour and a half later they were all visibly mashed. I had tried Exodus, the ones with TMFPP, before, and did my best to warn them about the many negative side effects I had experienced (extreme jaw clamping, contracted gut and extended loss of appetite) but everyone just saw me as a spoilsport and didn't pay any attention. P1 (one of the dudes on four) said that it was almost as good as a roll. 



At this point I dropped my half Acid blotter (T 0:00) and we all sat around in the slowly fading sun, enjoying the last few moments of relaxation before the big night ahead. As my acid kicked in (T 0:45) I had a balloon and this confirmed that it was a good half dip, some very interesting visuals were occuring already. Also, since Euphoria came in four packs my mate P2 had a couple spare, so I thought what the hey and joined the others in partaking of this strange chemical. 



By nightfall (T 1:45) I was well charged and anticipating the E to really do the business. The countdown was a bit of an anticlimax, probably because none of us had dropped our eccies yet. We wanted to hold out as long as possible, but at one am we could no longer resist (T3:30) and dropped. We walked around for a while, to pass the time and soon I was feeling extremely strange. I have no idea when it happened but at some stage I suddenly realised that I was no longer on Earth. I don't mean this metaphorically at all, I was literally on another planet. I think it was Mars or something. I felt like I was completely lost, but in a good way. The time distortion was just unbelievable. Seconds seemed like hours. Me, P1 and G ended up at the Tribal tent and tried to dance for a while but then we looked at each other and came to the realisation that we were seriously, seriously twisted. 



We made the wise decision to head back to base camp and have bizarre, in-depth discussions about nothing in particular. My mate P1 had a different pill to us called an X-files and he was convinced that he was seeing aliens. Since I was on Mars, this made sense to me at the time. It helped that all the hard-trancers were running around with glow sticks. I started raving on about evolution, (I had been listening to a lot of Bill Hicks) and we looked up at the stars which were bright in a way that you only get in the middle of the bush. We sat there for about two hours, until our rolls became a bit more manageable.



As the first light appeared, we headed out to the main stage to see what we had come for, a DnB set from 48 Sonic and Riddle. It was kinda weird seeing a whole lot of people as wasted as us in the light in the middle of a field. The set was awesome, they spun the hugely appropriate `Morning Light' by Concord Dawn. After this we went back to base, where in my tent were a few Nos' I had been saving. I had a balloon, and this was when I found myself in a corridor of infinity, that was marked by web-like electric blue patterns. I could see in front of me and behind me at the same time! Weird.



Outside, the others were smoking a blunt that had two types of weed and generous amounts of hash in it (no tobacco, but it was still as big as a cigar). As we were partaking of this I had a bizarre and mystical experience. A small child (four or five yrs old) had wandered over to our group. I immediately felt empathy towards her. She was telling me something about how she had lost her friend although she didn't seem upset or concerned. I felt a queasy sense of guilt as I watched the hash smoke waft in huge clouds around her face. I wished to god that she wasn't there, but knew she had some kind of message for me. I couldn't interpret this hidden message though. It was just like a dream that I knew I'd forget when I woke up.



I was coming down now, so I sought the comfort of my tent. Unfortunately, so had what seemed like a dozen or more white tailed spiders (poisonous). I wasn't imagining this! I decided to sleep outside on a rug in the sun instead. 



The next day I could still feel the chemicals in my system. We decided on a change of scene and went to stay in Hahei the next night. A few tokes of Pot brought me a sense of warm well-being and as I lay under the stars with my closest friends I felt truly blessed to be on this crazy planet, no matter how fleeting and strange my experience of it has been and will be.
