* June 4, 1989 - Beijing, China: Many students are killed by government

  troops while protesting for democratic reforms in Tiananmen Square.



* June 4, 1989 - Washington, DC suburbs: Through a a series of

  coincidences, I ran across a little square of white blotter paper

  containing a sample of Hofmann's magical elixir, and so have my first

  trip.



* June 4, 1999 - Beijing, China: Soldiers raised the Chinese flag over 

  Tiananmen Square in Beijing, as China tried to ignore the anniversary of

  the student democracy movement there a decade ago. 



* June 4, 1999 - Washington, DC suburbs: Unlike in China, June 4 is an

  anniversary full of joy for me, and one which I celebrated quite fully

  this year, as is fitting for 10 years\ldots 



        Ahh yes\ldots  my 10th rebirthday! This is one that I won't soon

forget. I hadn't had LSD in a pretty long time\ldots  about 15 months since my

last mild experience, and around 2 years since my last full blown LSD

experience, which had been a little on the rough side. I've been exploring

other entheogens quite thoroughly in this time, but I stayed away from LSD

for a variety of reasons.



        With my 10th rebirthday approaching, however, I decided it was

time for a reunion. I obtained a hit of green geltab acid, and set it

aside for the upcoming anniversary.



        June 4th finally came, and I felt that old familiar nervous

anticipation rising in me. Acid! My first and most familiar ally\ldots  I

found myself incredibly nervous, which struck me as silly. I've done this

countless times. I've done crazy shit like ayahuasca. Why is a little hit

of acid causing so much tension? I guessed just because it had been so

long. I decided on 11PM for take-off.



        Around 10:15, I decided to go on my regular internet chatroom to

relax and smoke some cannabis before take-off. I go on there and find one

person taking AMT, one person taking DPT, one person taking AMT with

mushrooms, one taking DPT with ketamine, someone else taking LSD, and a

few other assorted trippers. Surprise, it looks like the universe decided

to throw me a spontaneous rebirthday virtual-party! Well, alright then!



        I placed the sacrament at the foot of my Buddha carving, and lit a

stick of incense. I reflected upon all that I had been through with LSD

over the last 10 years, and all the wonderful things I have learned from

it. 11PM, down the hatch! Well, like I said 10 years ago, theres no

turning back now!



        I felt a strong alert by 11:15PM, and knew I was going to be in

for a wild ride. I was also overcome by a strong wave of nostalgia about

LSD. I put on headphones and listened to Moody Blues, broke out a folder

of my old LSD-influenced drawings, and began reminiscing. I read old LSD

reports of mine (unfortunately, I've only made a few of them). I thought

about how different of a world it was when I first fell through the rabbit

hole. There was still a Soviet Union. The Internet was still not much more

beyond the wet dreams of a few visionary geeks. Someone reminded me that

the Tiananmen Square massacre happened the same day. 10 years. Wow\ldots 



        Around 12:15, I wasn't tripping unusually hard, I was at a Plus 2

on the Shulgin scale. I started to get worried that I wouldn't trip any

harder. By 12:30-12:45, however, I realized that I was about to trip quite

a bit harder. I went to lay down just as I found myself hurled into an

amazing Plus 4. I remembered how much I loved LSD right then, and wondered

why I had let it go so long.



        The peak was spectacular. I was laying in bed in a dark room, the

best way to experience acid I think, and the closed-eye visuals were

mindblowing. At the same time, I felt that high-speed LSD consciousness

train blasting through my skull. The visuals and thoughts were very much

in sync. I thought about many things\ldots  how much I had missed acid, how

much I had learned from it over the years\ldots  and then into reflections on

my life. Realization that this was my first acid trip as a non-smoker,

which struck me as being an important milestone. After a little while, I

stopped thinking *about* anything and I became just a process of

abstract thinking, accompanied by the fantastic acid visualscapes of the

disembodied eye state. I experienced strange temporal distortions, had

visions of the LSD `spirit' appearing to me as a yound woman dressed in

white muslin, saw both the dark and the light sides of acid as a sort of

`This Is Your Life' nostalgia session. I had a particularly amusing vision

of people putting tabs of acid to their tongues and immediately sprouting

wings from their mouths and flying off to the `real' world (a la `The

Matrix', sort of).



        Sometime during the height of the peak, around 1-1:30AM I would

estimate, I had a very strange experience. I had the sensation that I was

somehow communicating with an entity - which I soon realized was Becky.

This had a strange feeling of being real\ldots  some sort of telepathic link.

I found myself talking to her soundlessly in some sort of impossible

space, and rapidly became confused as to which one of us was who. `Whats

happening?' I felt her think\ldots  and I thought back `I don't know, I just

think our realities are overlapping\ldots we'll just have to ride it out.' I

felt a strong feeling of caring, and soon after, it was as if we zoomed

apart at hundreds of miles per hour and the contact was broken. The

strange thing is that the next morning when I spoke with her, she asked

`So, did you feel us talking about you last night?'



        Around 3-3:30AM, things leveled off enough that I was able to move

around. I returned to the internet chatroom, and soon someone convinced me

to try a little ketamine, saying that the combination was amazing. I cut

some out into two large lines, returned to my bedroom, snorted the

ketamine, and lay down. I waited. I got a strange visual effect where

everything began to `melt' somewhat - the effect is similar to what would

happen if you sprayed water on a watercolor painting. This only lasted a

short while. I felt a mild increase in the trip's `weirdness' factor, but

overall it seemed to make no real big difference to the character of the

trip - I think I was already too far out for it to have any effect. I

wasn't very disappointed, not being very fond of ketamine to begin with. 



        I got back on the chatroom and had a great time talking about

tripping with everyone for a while. Around 5AM, I decided to take a little

bit of DPT to boost myself back up a little. It added a little vibrational

signature to the trip, and brought back some intensity, but didn't add a

whole lot to the trip, as I only did a small quantity (25mg at most).



        2 or 3 hours later I got an email from some guy in Serbia who had

emailed us a few times before. It was a picture of a peace sign overlaid

on a potleaf. I decided to go to CNN's web s ite and saw a headline saying

the war in Kosovo could be over by the end of the weekend. I made a

little prayer for peace.



        Around 7AM, I had dropped down to a level where I was mainly

stimulated, more than tripping, and decided it was time to take a little

GHB to make myself sleepy. No such luck! I ended up consuming enough GHB

to tranquilize a herd of elephants over the next 6 hours, and barely

noticed any effect over the lingering LSD stimulation. I finally managed

to fall into a fitful sleep around 1PM, sleeping until 6, when I woke up

physically drained but mentally full of energy.



        This was one amazing trip, totally worthy of a 10-year anniversary

celebration! And it was a spectacular reunion with an old, trusted friend.

I won't be letting it go that long again before I schedule another date

with my beloved Lady Sidney the Divine\ldots
