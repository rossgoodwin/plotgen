For some reason or another I fell asleep rather early Friday night, and thus woke up early Saturday morning with an odd feeling of having `missed the party.'  I then realized that tonight there would be a local Sci Fi marathon, checked my watch again (it was about 10 AM) and realized I was in a perfect situation to consume one of those capsules of AMT I have sitting around in my freezer.



Sci Fi Marathon is a traditional time to trip round these parts, and knowing I would find like company later in the day, and that I hadn't eaten for about 12 hours, and that the last two meals before that were simple and non-tyramine laden (http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/maois/maois\_info2.shtml), I promptly downed the 50 mg pill at 10:11:12 AM with a swig of water.



I spent some time tidying up my room, but knew not to expect much for perhaps several hours, so decided to lay down and `chill' for a while.  To my surprise, I fell back asleep for about an hour and woke up a bit startled (not the traditional waking-up-tripping-and-confused thing, but getting there).  About this time I noticed some waves of nausea that I was able to supress for quite a while, but eventually overwhelmed me and forced me to the bathroom for a quick purge (fortunately with nothing in my stomach!)



I wished I had a bowl or ten of (insert your favorite anti-nauseate) to help smooth out this tumultous beginning, but alas I was freshly out.  In the end it was about \_4\_ hours and two trips to the sink before I felt able to move around freely.  During most of this time I writhed around on the bed (quite delicious fractal closed eye visuals when I could find total darkness (those airline eye-rest things are great) but for the most part nothing with eyelids open apart from little rainbow halos around small (christmas-tree style) lights and a feeling of movement on the edges of the field of vision (outside the `fovea'?).)  While writhing on the bed (mostly due to discomfort, not joyous ecstasy) I realized I was thinking in a somewhat more analytical way than usual, but nothing along the lines of the sharp razor edge of LSD analytical.



Just after emerging from this four hour hellhole into a `reasonably nice place' a friend dropped by with fresh fruit (as fresh as it gets in New England in January) and some smokeable goodies!  We smoked a bowl or two and then moved on to the opium.  I'd had an outrageously chill opium experience earlier in the week with this friend, and was eager to try some more, despite the AMT (which was present but easily under control).



A couple good tokes of that fantastical-smelling stuff and I suddenly felt myself quite unsure where the AMT was ending and the opium beginning.  This is in no way a testament to the two substances' similarity in effect, but rather towards the subtlety of the AMT `trip.'



In fact, I could imagine myself not realizing I were tripping, if it weren't for the long period of nausea, the keying-in to the overanalytical brain-state (a state I could attain without drugs, but one I noticed nevertheless and identified as a `standardish sign of tripping') and the slight visual disturbances (oh I forgot, I also had quite blurry vision.  Things would be in focus, but have odd halos around them of blur.  Then it was as if each eye was seeing a different set of halos, and the two would mismatch (though I didn't notice it having stuck to a room all day, I can see how this effect would lead to screwed up depth-perception).



At last the sun set and once again it was night, my standard tripping time.  People started showing up and plans were made to get together for a shindig that night, perhaps skipping the sci fi marathon completely (though the concept is appealing, I feel like it would be a waste of tripping-brain cycles to sit and watch cheese-tastic 80's sci fi blockbusters like `Innespace' albeit on the big screen.)  It was warmer than usual out (almost freezing!) but we still punted around and managed to avoid starting the (quite short) walk to campus.  Finally, a friend with a borrowed pick up truck (and the only possible ride) riled us into action by eating his microdots and stating that we need to leave nownownow or he's going to start tripping and then we have no ride.  =)  [Obviously don't drive/operate heavy machinery while tripping, y0!]



Once on campus we clustered in a friend's suite (Happiness!) where a hookah was brought out and many bowls smoked.  I found many things quite funny and amusing, and was very talkative, but certainly not balls-to-the-wall tripping.  I even contemplated reboosting with some new substance to ride out the night, but ended up not deciding on what to do (it's a tough call\ldots  I'd have liked a phenethylamine but wasn't really in the mood for 2C-I or 2C-C, and god not T2 now.  Also still vaguely aware of possible MAOI interactions, so no rolling, but perhaps a pseudo-pharmahuasca?  Alas no DMT to be found, and by the time I'd figured half this shit out anyway I had been distracted by something else anyway.)



I felt my stomach complain and realized I hadn't eaten for far too many hours.  Managed to munch on some bread and fruit, and eventually got most of the way through a bowl of potsta.  I'm sorry body, I promise I'll take good care of you tomorrow!



Anyway, the rest of the trip basically cruised pretty smoothly down to zero.  It was long, and it was pretty boring.  I'd heard a few things about 50 mgs smacking people around pretty hard (the sky opening two days later and god coming out, for example) but found it basically not worth the nausea and the boredom at the end.  Perhaps a lower or higher dose will lead to a better ratio of `worthwhile and enjoyable peak' to `crappy side effects.'



I'm in no rush to really try this substance again for a while, especially if there is LSD around instead.  Though honestly, after all this dabbling with research chemicals, there are few I'd do if there were big fat piles of LSD around.  DPT and 2C-B perhaps.



In retrospect, this whole ride may have been much better if I had accompanied it with very heavy cannabis use the whole way through.  Perhaps some brownies or the like would be appropriate.  I ate the potsta too late into the AMT trip for them to coincide.  Also, for something so amphetamine-like, I sure had a serious case of the yawns.  Probably couldn't fall asleep in the middle of it, but definitely felt like lying down and closing my eyes.  The blurriness in vision was annoying, and my pupils were about the size of videodiscs when I checked in a mirror.  I had a bit of neck tension (standard when tripping) and some of the overall restlessness/can't-get-comfortable syndrome.  Perhaps the stimulant side of this substance comes out more noticeably when doing physical activity.  Next time while dancing or hang-gliding perhaps?  I finally fell asleep 20 hours after ingestion, though I could probably have done it quite easily 4 hours beforehand.  But then I woke up just now 7 hours later and I feel bizarrely well rested and awake.  Maybe it's the potsta kicking in  =)



All in all, I'm glad to have expanded my understanding of tryptamines as a whole, but boy am I in no rush at all to do that again.
