Just woke up after a fun Saturday night with friends. Didn't score weed as planned but it is now time to play with the Methylone again. This is my second Methylone trip, the first was on 125mg, and this time I'm by myself, because I don't know of anyone in town who wants to do it and is free today. But hey, that means I can write a blow by blow trip report, instead of just retrospect like Methylone experience \#1.



9:28 a.m.



Very inaccurately divided up an approx. 250mg dose and mixed it into some sugar free cranberry kool aid.  \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:NOT\_WEIGHED\#\#  It is a taste that is bearable. Barely. It makes me gag to drink this shit, actually. It is really hard to get down. Much more potent than last time (when it was mixed in Kool Aid and I could barely taste it) and the glass is smaller so it's concentrated too. Bleah.



9:33



The disgusting concoction is in my belly now, no turning back. Guess I will go outside and smoke in case I am too fucked up to go outside later.



9:40



I'm starting to feel a little different. After only 10 minutes. Yikes! It kicked in in only 1/3 the time of my first time w/ 125mg.



9:44



Put on some techno, my music of choice. I can't tell if the way I feel is due to not taking my antipsychotic, or to the M1. Breathing a little harder than usual. 



9:50



Definitely feeling some effect now. Just an abnormal feeling in general, feeling kind of hard to concentrate, still breathing in big deep sighs. Think I'm going to go to my fav chat room and just forget about this shit until I can no longer deny it.



9:55



Nevermind about chat, it is definitely kicking in. I can't chat now. I can't do anything. Don't want to. Doesn't feel like mdma this time for some reason (it felt similar at 125mg) but feels ok. I can't decide how it feels but there is no question that I am getting intensely fucked up. I'm going to go lay down and listen to the music.



10:39 Okay I guess I am peaking now. At this dose, the M1 Totally incapacitates me. I don't feel like doing anything. I'm moving in slow motion. My legs are spastic. It's not at all like rolling, but it was at 125mg. I am sweating like mad but had to turn off the A/C because it makes me feel really, uncomfortably cold. Again, music is not enhanced. This time I pay attention to my sense of touch, but it doesn't feel any better than usual. I don't know how to describe this feeling. I guess I kind of like it but I really don't know what to think.



Mentally, I'm feeling no different. There is no head trip, but I am not in an overwhelmingly positive mindset either. A pretty neutral mindset, actually, and the feelings it's creating in my body are not positive or negative, really. This is definitely a strong dose. Definitely doesn't make me want to dance, I can barely move. Just don't want to do anything. Don't feel social. Am definitely too fucked up to walk outside and smoke. I think this drug is totally neutral for me at this high of a dose. Don't like it, don't dislike it. If this had been my first impression of M1, I wouldn't have done it again so soon.



11:26



Still very much peaking. Because of the way the M1 is making me breathe, my fingers have become inflexible and it's hard to type and my face is numb and tingly. That can't be good. Wish I could go smoke a cig but too fucked up. No energy. Face feels weird and twitchy. I'm cold. Really cold. The temperature exaggeration is even more exaggerated with a higher dose, to the point of being Really annoying. It is so hard to find that happy place between hot and cold. 



This is not as good as I expected. Maybe because I'm alone. Probably won't want to do it again at this dose. No euphoria whatsoever, which is what I had been hoping to achieve by taking more, so there's no point in ever taking this much again. Going to go lay down again.



11:30 I puked. Wasn't bad, only felt nauseated for about 5 seconds right before it happened. Puking is not really common on this drug from what I've read, but I did take a huge ass dose. Didn't taste the chemical when I threw up and I think it's all been absorbed. I don't much care at this point.



11:40 Started coming down a bit after I puked. Maybe. I think. I can't tell now. I am still immensely fucked up, but my fingers are no longer stiff and I can type again at a normal pace. I really don't know what to think of this stuff at this dose. It is better than no drugs at all, I guess. But not as good as going to hang out with friends. Hopefully soon I can go outside and smoke a cig. Not a lot of jaw clenching but some. Still sweating. I would have never had drawn a comparison between this and mdma if this had been my first time taking this drug. There is no rush this time, perhaps because I am too fucked up to relax and let it come. 



11:48 Never got thirsty. My eyes were only dilated but a teeny bit---only I would be able to notice. Want to go outside and smoke and I think I am ready.



11:55 Forgot I had a dime of weed. I can't believe my luck! Now I'm going to smoke it! Breaking out in goosebumps of cold even though the A/C is off and it's hot in here. I am in a baking hot apartment in Summertime sweating my ass off, and I'm cold.



12:17 Still very much fucked up and feeling unlike myself, which is probably from not taking my antipsychotic (didn't know if it would interact). Sometimes, like on my first m1 trip with friends, I skip it and nothing happens. But sometimes it makes me feel really strange. 



12:22 This stuff definitely kills the appetite. And I really think it does negate the effects of Cannabis, though I've read some reports that say the exact opposite so YMMV.



12:27 It's lasting a lot longer than I anticipated. Maybe because I took a really high dose. I've been seeing white sparkles, like twinkling white Christmas lights, this whole time, esp w/ eyes closed. I can't NOT notice them. My vision is very very very slightly swimmy. Don't feel like socializing, which is weird for me, but again I think that is due to skipping the antipsychotic. I really want to take it soon. 



12:37 Getting bored. The internet not being down would help. Well, no, I don't even feel like doing that. Don't I need to do something but sit/lay around thinking? 



12:51 This stuff really cuts my urge to smoke cigarettes, unlike most drugs. I don't feel bored or like I need to do something now that I have totally accepted that I can't and don't want to do anything but lay there and let my mind wander.



12:57 Haven't had any energy or moved much of all this whole time. Still couldn't describe the feeling. Still breathing abnormally and cold. And twitchy. The most negative thing about this drug is feeling so cold and listless and sweaty, but I don't think it's too bad at the low dose. It's enough to discourage me from taking a high dose, though. It's raining now. Don't feel like doing anything. Don't even much feel like smoking bud but I think I'll smoke again, pointlessly, since it's not much getting me high. Not that I need to be any higher. For godsakes, I am still FUBAR'ed.



1:17. Still very very fucked up. I've been tripping Hard on this shit for how long now? Let me see. 3.5 hours. Longer than expected. Still not a shred of euphoria. 



1:46 Still very fucked up. The effect comes in waves. Still breathing weird, for a time my lips were feeling tingly from it again. Laying down feels best.



2:30 Feels nice to lay in bed \& smoke pot. Peaceful. Not sweating as bad, but still really gone. (Note written later: I think this is where the experience started to move from neutral to mildly positive.)



3:49 While laying in bed I found out that this drug does not have sexual effects other than making orgasm even better and more intense. And more sweaty. Like one of the other reports said, it left me quaking.



3:50 I can't believe how long this is lasting this time. Good thing I didn't have plans. It feels better now, not that it felt bad earlier, but I like the level I'm at now much more than the more intense level, it feels more like the first trip now. I think I'll stick to the lower doses. They are more fun, feel better, etc. Taking more did not intensify the drug, it totally made it change into a different drug. Then again, my chemistry could be different today than it was that day I took 125mg. I won't be doing 250mg again, though, because 125 is plenty good. Less is more, I think, and better for my body, and my stash will last longer. 



I have no desire to re-dose. The thought of taking more seems so unhealthy with the maxed-out way I feel now. I didn't think about re-dosing my first time because it was so late in the day. My hands and fingers are numb and stiff again from all this funny breathing. And they shake! The comedown is long and slow and I feel happy and calm. But not euphoric. Life seems pretty normal today. Gonna go lay back down--that's all I did today, all day, so might as well do it some more.



5:12 Fingers back to normal. I finally am not pouring sweat but still sweaty and cold, still mildly happy, just been layin in bed smoking weed and enjoying the feeling. The bed is soaked, yuck, I will change it when all this is over. I still really don't know what to think. I have mixed feelings. It's an ok drug in this dose, I'd give it a 2 or 2.5 out of 5. Muscles and jaw have been tight for hours now but it doesn't really bother me. I hate being sweaty, though. Haven't wanted a cigarette since it started raining, which is totally unlike me. I smoke when I'm sick, I smoke when I take chantix, I smoke a pack a day. This is too weird. I still haven't eaten a thing today. I wonder if just a pinch of this stuff could be used as like a diet pill. Not enough to fuck you up. But people would just abuse them and take a bunch. 



5:57 And am still fucked up. Luckily I am pretty experienced w/all types of drugs as to not ponder the age old question of ``Will I be this way forever?'' My face feels weird and spastic but not too bad. I might go smoke a cig out of sheer habit. Wasn't even much motivated to smoke pot. This chemical is like nothing else I've ever tried. A totally unique feeling, which makes it hard to describe. 



6:07 The smoke was ok. I felt a little thirsty for the first time. Felt like I might want to talk to someone but don't care if I don't. My mouth is kind of spastic. I feel like I am making strange faces. Drank some Cranberry. Not really hungry yet, but I can imagine eating again one day. Getting a little of my energy back. Still don't feel like doing much of anything but spacing out and thinking about things. I am glad the sweating is dying down. 



And at 6:14 I'm still fucked up, but feeling more normal. This turned out to be an all-day affair! In a good mood, didn't get the blues as I was coming down (didn't the first time either)\ldotsthen again I never got the blues after MDMA either. It would actually make me feel great for the rest of the week. I think a lot of drugs affect me differently than they affect most people. But there are some things that are the same. It's not a huge difference most of the time, but they do.



I guess I am feeling more like doing something since I started writing again. M1 is like 1,000,000 times more anti-motivating than weed. I did not want to move. Fuck taking this drug at a club or a rave. It's no substitute for club drugs, it saps the energy. Sometimes it feels like it is leaving big holes in my thoughts. Like I've got a hole through my head and the grasp of thought is missing. But thinking is still easy. I experienced that on both trips. Wow, I am finally cooling off without feeling like I'm going to shiver myself to death; think I will go take a shower and get all this nasty sweat off me. 



6:41 Shower was great! I feel clean for the first time since I started sweating, and my energy level is almost normal, I don't feel weak and I'm no longer moving in slow motion. Can't believe it was too much effort to smoke pot sometimes. I might smoke some now, but I'm really not craving it, though it might work now cos I don't really feel like I'm on anything any more except that my face still makes weird expressions. Probably they have been so slight, I don't think anyone would notice. I just feel them. And I feel a little better than I should. I feel fine. 



6:52 Took two antipsychotics for good measure, to replace the two missed doses. I am now warming one of those ``healthy'' TV dinners, what an oxymoron. Not real hungry, but earlier eating was unimaginable. I guess the only thing left I'd like to address in this report is weather I will be able to fall asleep normally after such a heavy dose, or weather the m1 will give me insomnia. I am still a little sweaty, damn. And I am still (a little) fucked up.



6:58 Still shaky too. But the food tastes good. 



7:24 Definitely still too fucked up to talk to my mom. Kind of tired, even though I did nothing but lay there and trip all day. Think I'll go to sleep just fine. And before midnight. (Early 4 me) 



7:42 Got stoned. I feel so nice. Yay. I like this feeling. Don't want to do anything but sit here and feel it. Maybe even 50mg of this shit would be good. I am still on the long, slow comedown and the cannabis kicked it back in some. 



7:49 Thinking about how much I love my best friend and her boyfriend. I love being around them. And my other best friend and her boyfriend, as well. I feel lucky to know these people. Happy thoughts.



8:00 It was weird spending a whole day totally alone. That is, if I don't go check my missed calls and see who tried to get in touch with me today. Little do they know, hah.



8:33pm Getting stoned again. I am just going to smoke this whole dime today. That's more like my usual self! I think I'm totally totally back to baseline now. I'm not cold, not sweaty at all! Not even shaky anymore. Every now and then I notice a twinge of something\ldotsthere is still that tendency towards motionlessness and thought, but I feel like I did before I took the dose, only in a little better of a mood. It was a fun day. I didn't realize how fun it was until it was over. Now the memory of it makes me happy. I feel normal. If I didn't know I got fucked up today and evaluated the moment, I'd never guess I'd been tripping all day, that's how baseline I feel. 



9:50 As I smoke out in the recliner, I'm falling asleep. Time for bed. Night!



(Monday) 7:54am



Went to sleep with no problem and slept well all night, but this morning when I woke up earlier than usual (perhaps because I went to bed early) I felt weird (not mentally weird though). And thirsty, despite the nearly half-gallon of sugar free Kool Aid I drank before bed. My mood was fine, but I felt really exhausted and the shakiness and face spasticity were back. I feel like my expression is noticeably unnatural, though it probably wouldn't be to the observer it just feels weird. And I hate the shaky feeling.



Wish I had a benzodiazepine, that would probably help. But I do not have one. Alcohol would be a second-best option, but don't have any of that either and don't feel like dealing with questioning looks for buying some at 8 am. Will try taking a sedative (trazadone) to block the effect of M1, that's all I have that would help, and a few hits of weed. I'll try to go back to sleep. This feeling is kind of like being on speed, which I am not a big fan of. The quick movements, the shaky urgency. But it is tolerable. I think it's because I took too much.



None of this is enough to discourage me from trying this stuff again, but I would never take 250 mg again for sure. Also feeling a little more tendency to sweat than normal. Apparently I was still fucked up when I went to bed feeling so great, because I don't feel that great now (physically) but mentally I am fine. Hope I feel normal before I have to leave for work at 3. 



8:04 Made a phone call to my boss to set up the day's appointments. He wasn't even awake yet, but when I left him a message I was able to talk totally normally to him. I don't think that's the prob, it's the physical feeling. The drug is such a physical drug in all ways. Not visual, not mental, not auditory, but physical. At this point, I can function just fine I guess if I ignore the way I feel physically. Going to have some breakfast while I watch some tv and smoke the rest of the weed, and go back to bed if I can. 



8:19 A few hits of weed soothed me a lot. Or maybe the trazadone is kicking in. Whatever, I feel a Lot better. Maybe it was just the shock of jumping out of bed at 7-something and has worn off. But I feel better now and I am about to eat and take an antipsychotic.



8:28 Done with breakfast and I really only feel about 25\% of the hangover that I felt when I woke up. Is it due to having taken the trazadone, or would it have worn off anyway? I dunno. Will go smoke a cigarette, finish the weed, and maybe go back to bed. I don't feel as happy as I would the day after mdma, I just feel normally happy, but a bit more happy than normal---if that makes any sense. And tired and a bit out of breath. M1 really affects the way I breathe. 



8:42 Marijuana feels better than usual. Maybe because it felt nullified yesterday. I'm heavily stoned. Well, as heavily stoned as you can get from schwag. Wish I had some JWH-anything. That shit is like weed crack!



8:57 I just remembered this feeling that happened in the middle of my dream last night and woke me up. I did not remember it until just now; the cannabis brought it back to me. It was intense and euphoric, physically and mentally. But this happens sometimes weather or not I take drugs, and I think it is from skipping two doses of antipsychotics because it reminds me of one of the varieties of mania I used to experience before my psychotic bipolar disorder was being treated. I don't think it has much to do with the m1, but I mention it because I usually only get stuff like that Before I have taken the missed dose of antipsychotic, not after. M1 wasn't nearly as good as that at any point, and I wasn't expecting it to be.



9:10 I love cannabis. 



9:37 Feel normal now except for stiffness in the neck and face and a little tired. Not used to having a hangover and I've had two this month. I mostly just smoke pot and drink these days 3-4 times a week each, take a bunch of narcotics once a month (and I like the way that hangover feels). So hangovers really don't happen to me much any more. 



1:36 Same as last entry. 



10:27pm. Finally got my weed! I couldn't even tell that I was hung over anymore by the time I left for work at three, and when I did have the hangover before that, I didn't notice it unless I thought about the fact that I had a hangover. Good mood all day. Everything I did today seemed to have a little grit to the energy in it, but nothing anyone could notice or commented on. 



(Tuesday)



I felt shaky this morning but it faded as the morning wore on.



(Wednesday)



A totally normal day. No symptoms. That concludes my 2nd Methylone report.
