I am a fairly experienced psychonaut. Many different things, weed, hydrocodone, codeine, oxycodone, amphetamines, magic mushrooms, A. Muscaria, DXM, LSA, 2c-I, Salvia Divinorum \& extracts, Devil ether, Zolpidem (Ambien), Methylphenidate (Ritalin), Nitrous Oxide. I am going to describe here the experience dominated by A. Muscaria.



This entire experience took place in the course of two days. It started off with me and by buddy S getting together after work and classes in my room and trying to decide what to do for a lovely Wednesday night. We started off by smoking some Cannabis which we did throughout majority of this time.



We proceeded to crush an entire pile of hydrocodone pills, dissolving the powder in hot water, then cooling it down to about 10 deg. C. We discarded the solid formed by filtering it through a coffee filter and washing with additional cold water. We then drank the bitter tasting liquid by the shot. We felt the usual relaxed and heavy on the body feeling of hydrocodone about 15 minutes later. No more than half an hour later we were unable to move or talk too much. We were sure of one thing, which was that this was just the beginning. I felt as if I drifted in and out of the reality through audible or visual glimpse of it. The closed eye visuals started and the music simply carried the visuals along. It was very animated and dream-like.



Once we were able to again start to communicate with the rest of the world about T+3 hours, I decided to find more music to listen to. There were a few incidences of audible hallucinations that were marked by either sound delay or overtones following different actions, which simply were not there. Hitting the keyboard keys sounded like a deep sound coming from a barrel. This was not the usual high I would get by taking all those pills; it was a lot more pronounced and clear, persisting for total of 6 hours and continuing to a long night of extremely vivid dreams, the kind I have not had since being a child.



When the next afternoon came, we were still feeling rather disoriented and relaxed, just about ready for more. This time a few other people joined us and we all ate A. Muscaria. At first we all ate 5 grams each and waited for almost two hours. Then we decided to take more because we were only feeling the drunk-like effects of it. I ended up totaling 6.5grams of dried caps while some of us ate from 8 to 10 grams total. Thee people never got any more than the drunk and tired feeling through the entire night and went to sleep early. For some reason it simply did not have the effect on some people. Me and the friend who ate 10 grams were now beginning to feel much different. About T+3.5 hours, not very long after we smoked a blunt. The Cannabis eliminated any nausea we might have experienced otherwise, but by now our minds were much too preoccupied to think about that.



Time seemed to stand still. I looked at my watch and the had that shows seconds was moving in such a fashion that I could count to three in my mind before it would change position. Every single one of our senses was heightened to an enormous degree. Several times during the next 4 hours or so I experienced synaesthesia, where I was able to smell colors and see sounds. It is a rather indescribable feeling of the awesome plasticity of the mind. Euphoria was there in episodes, but it was constantly battling against the rushing feeling of extremely fast pace and expectation to die that comes along with some of the more heavy trips. There was a hint of the amphetamine-like push that gave a sharp edge to parts of the trip.



The visuals of this trip were nothing like the ones produced by mushrooms, acid or phenethylamines. Instead of the usual fluid movement and crawling, it was very fast and abrupt type of visuals that would flash and go away. Audible hallucinations occurred as well, where we were not able to tell whether one of us said something or we imagined it. The best part of the synaesthesia was having the ability to look at something or smell it and then see the entire history of the object in front of my eyes. Imagery was fast and sometimes lucid.



The last stage of the A. Muscaria trip was the most confusing and hardest to grasp and understand. This was about 6 hours into the trip when we decided to split because we were getting quite tired and the visuals and synaesthesia were now almost gone. I attempted to lie down on my bed and finally relax and get my heart rate back to baseline. Only problem was that my mind kept racing and I could not get myself to stop thinking and so I got into a cycle of trying to see how long I can keep my attention span. I started my mission by periodically walking from my room to the one where my friend lived in another part of the building. I would come up to him and see him half asleep on his bed, still tripping hard and ask him some nonsensical question about memory.



I'm not exactly sure how long this went on because time became hard to comprehend and it was even harder to focus on a mission that only existed in my mind. I have not been able to comprehend up to this day. When I was finally done tripping I went to sleep after the last bowl of weed. I woke up the next day and was rested, but still rather confused internally and did not have any want to repeat this experience any time soon, if ever.



My friend's night was a little bit different. He was explained in the morning that during the night he jumped out of his bed and started yelling gibberish in English and Japanese, even though he was not fluent in Japanese. He later carried on to go outside and have a cigarette. As he was smoking it, he decided to start walking around to keep warm, he was running in a circle around a pole by the time the cigarette was done.



I'm not sure which was it, the potency of the mushrooms, or the combination of a lot of hydrocodone the night before, but something made this by far the one experience I would call a real `trip', where reality was changed in a much more intense and strange way than any other.
