One night my two friends and I decided to snort 50mg, each, of DPT in my basement. I tried to prep them for what they were in store for, but there really is no way to do that for this drug. As one of my friends says `DPT grabs him by the balls and takes him for a ride whether he is ready or not.' 



There was immediate effects setting in just 5 minutes after use. We proceeded to watch THE ROAD WARRIOR on my big screen with surround sound. Nearly 10 minutes after use, one of my friends started vomiting pretty heavily. He continuously said `what the hell is this shit', and `what did u give me'. Our reaction time to this drug was about 5 to 10 minutes with no coming up interval. 



When I entered this heavy beginning I saw my basement in a warped vision with some blurred sight. When I stood over my friend, trying to comfort him through the vomiting, I saw scales growing and peeling off his back. This was a little disturbing but I calmed myself knowing that it was just in my head. I then had to help my brother, who was our sober buddy, with the cleaning up of the vomit. I didn't even care about the vomit, it looked like bugs crawling around so I picked them up and threw them away. There was also a constant buzzing, like that of a Chinese gong, but continuously ringing. 



My other friend was saying phrases like `I don't like this' and `quite frankly'. Both my friends, never having tried DPT before, decided to fight the experience. To better put it, they tried to stay clear-headed. 



Those phrases my friend was saying repeated in my head over and over again. At this time it felt like I was going through a cycle repeating itself over and over again, it was very intense almost too intense. 



We finally ended up in a bedroom with bunkbeds, in which we all laid down on. The intense part of the `cycle' was slowing down. At this moment my body felt warm and comfortable. The feelings all over my body were almost erotic. This was strange compared to before, because in the earlier stages I felt cold and chilly.

 

I decided to turn the lights out in the room, which had no windows. My visuals then started quite quickly. To update the time, this was probably about an hour or so after use, oh yeah, I almost completely lose time perception when on DPT. One hour can feel like 4 or the other way around. Anyway back to the visuals. There was many closed-eye and open-eye imagery. At first I closed my eyes for a very long time. I attempted to fall asleep because I knew that in the morning awaited my mom's question `Who threw up on the carpet last night?' 

 

Anyway back to the visuals. I closed my eyes and saw purple clouds. I was moving threw them like an airplane and as I was gliding through the clouds I saw random images. I saw a peace sign, a long curved guitar that almost looked like a vase/bong. May I also add that the Chinese gong sound was still ringing. Then my visual switched to a view of the room I was in. The room turned to a garden which grew extremely fast, as if in a science video they show you at school. Every vine, flower, branch, and shrub was growing toward the one ceiling light at the center of the room. I then saw my brother in a green Chinese dress , with his hair gelled into a small mo-hawk, still scrubbing the vomit. 

 

I decided to open my eyes and saw a black room, with purple, green, and dark red/blue shapes moving along the wall. All the colors we neon tone. My brother then flicked the lights one which ended the experience. 

 

It was about three hours later and it was a nice coming down. The room felt warm and sound. This went on for another hour. My friends and I then started talking up a storm about what we had seen and felt. And they eventually went to bed, but I couldn't sleep and caught up on my sleep the next day.
