First of all M-CAT should not be taken lightly. In these next few paragraphs I'm going to tell you my first, while I'm still feeling the effects so spelling may be a lil screwed up or grammar, but who really gives a F****? NOT mwaaah! But secondly, make sure if your taking it your first time make sure you have a scale so you don't start out with the wrong amount or it will be overwhelming. Third, remember to breath in and out or you will lose track \& catch yourself holding your breath. Fourthly idk if that's a real word (Fourthly) try keeping your body temperature down or you will feel like you have a fever \& this can also be overwhelming! BUT here's my first MCAT/mephedrone experience while I'm lightweight coming down from it. 



Alright, I came into contact with Mephedrone/MCAT from a reliable source over the internet, my parents don't know I've been into this kind of stuff, but all is well because I'm just testing the waters ;). And yes I do live with my parents, so I had to be very discreet with it. So I ordered approximately 7 grams off this dude \& it arrived this morning. I was so happy to have it but my parents were home \& I had to hide it. I have a very few sorted amounts of hiding spots around the house but I decided to go \& act like I was going to the bathroom to take a nice hot shower. I opened the bag and it had no smell to it at all, but I decided to put my finger in it and taste a few crystals, it had a salty weird taste but I guess that means its good quality stuff. I pulled my ID out of my pocket and started crushing up a pinch I had taken out, this was not a good idea, like I said you should take the right amount for your first time NEVER OVER-DO it, but me being me, crushed up what looked to be 600mg aproximately. (Was too exited. P.S. don't do what I do.) I have no tolerance at all to mephedrone or mdma, cocaine, etc. So I had the large line of Mcat \& spread it into two even lines, 100mg would be decent for a first timer, but like I said I was anxious and thought it wasn't as bad as ppl have been talking about but I decided to break a pen in pieces to create a straw to snort a line before \& a line after I got out of the shower to not make it look obvious ya know? Sooo



 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:NOT\_WEIGHED\#\#  



I've gotten a lot of info on Mephedrone and how it burns like hell so I thought to myself `how bad can it be'. So I snorted the first line and it burned like Hell!!! My eyes got immediately blood-shot red and couldn't open my eye for like 1 min until the burn wore off. I sat there for a couple minutes and thought to myself what a load of bullshit I'm not high/don't feel anything at all! *got undressed hopped in shower* but halfway through my shower I felt all hot \& slightly different, not mdma, but a different type euphoria coming on maybe even stronger\ldots sike idk\ldots but maybe sooooo



T:0:10

I got all dressed but kept the shower running because my dad was in the other room cooking breakfast. I snorted the second line and my other nostril and the other side of my face went numb. Waited a few minutes and it wore off \& BAMM!! I was f****! It all hit me at once and I was trippin balls. Not only did I take to much, it was my first time \& didn't know what the feeling was like at all. I sorta blacked out for a min but began to gain control \& snap out of this trance I was in!



T:0:20

I began to `roll' so hard I thought I was gonna die for a minute. I kept holding my breath \& forgetting to breath but when the side effects wore off it was the best feeling I've had in a long time. My heart started pounding so hard \& I started to sweat really bad. I mean not only was it a body high, I started have minor hallucinations and I had the sudden urge to brush my teeth because the taste was awful. Not only was this the biggest fail of my life but I was laughing hysterically when I noticed I was putting tooth-paste on the hair-brush I use VERY OFTEN. After throwing the brush away \& making a huge mess with the toothpaste I finally managed to actually grab the toothbrush \& stroke away. I began to clean up. I noticed I was shaking uncontrollably but EVERYTHING felt good \& I couldn't just focus on one thing. Sorta like you get the jittery feeling?



T:0:30

Now I have been in the bathroom for 30 min but it felt longer. But I began to get paranoid because I knew my dad was in the other room. I opened the door and managed to get to my room which is just around the corner of the bathroom. I sat on my bed and it was getting stronger and stronger by the minute. I just had a feeling I haven't reached the peak! I turned around and noticed my reflection in the mirror in my room was moving while I was just sitting down, I tried not to look but began to realize it was asking me to come here, so I got up and wobbled to the mirror (it felt like my legs were warm and wobbly). That's the closest I can put it. As I got closer to the mirror I began to ask myself this was amazing \& for this cheap!? Holy shit - outloud. That's when I noticed my dad standing right outside the door. He asks `What are you up to? Breakfast is ready.' It's so much harder to think on a high dosage of meph. So I responded `nothing just talking to myself as usual.' He's a pretty cool guy but he's not dumb but surprisingly bought it \& closed my door. I began to sweat even more but I was able to gain control of my mind/body. Everything seemed to be going smoothly\ldots I WISH.



T:0:50 

I'm still tripping but not as bad as before. When I was walked out of my room I noticed 4 10-mg Valium that must have fell out of a pocket, so I grabbed them, walked out of the room, grabbed a shot-glass filled it with a little bit of water and took all 4. Not hesitating with the Valiums, my mind went straight back to the Mcat. I thought it would last longer depending on what I read about it but the body high was intensively amazing. I really liked this stuff \& didn't want it to end but snorting it destroyed my nasal passages before so I recalled reading about some people put it in water \& drinking it or mixing it with anything and by doing this the high is less intense but lasts longer, so I gave it a try.



T:1:00

I pulled the capsule I had concealed in my pocket out and I eyeballed it, looked sorta like my first 600mg dose so far but I didn't want to take a risk and end up in the hospital, so I took half back and put the MCAT into the shot glass, along with a little water and down it went! Wasn't that bad just tasted like saltwater with a little mysterious flavor in it. I began to feel way different then I did at first, a more intense body high. At this moment I remembered my dad saying breakfast was ready, turned around and there was a full plate of delicious food sitting right in front of me! But\ldots NO APPETITE so I put the plate of amazing food in the microwave so I could save it for later.



T:1:10 

I get a jolly rancher to out of the candy jar we have and it immediately took the nasty salt taste out of my mouth. I walked around a little and begin to feel light as a feather! As if I could fly! Also I started dancing to some Rock \& Roll my dad was BUMPIN (listening too) in the other room. This dancing felt so uncontrollable and it suddenly felt like my body was going numb. But a good numb.



Valium kicks in.



T:1:25

Everything began to go slow motion the music was still going in and out of my ears and I felt really NICE! My mom walked into the room and asked me why my eyes looked like that, I said,'like what'? She said `your pupils are completely dilated \& your eyes are wide open, are you high?' I responded, `D0ooo0 ThEeeeYReaaally?' Talking in uncontrollable complete slomo, I knew my mom was onto something so thinking extremely fast I said `let me go see for myself', controlling my speech this time. Quickly I walked into my room, grabbed some Visine to help my eyes out a lil bit. I noticed it really helped but I just looked exhausted. I went back to my mom \& asked `what are you talking about, my eyes are normal \& I did just get out of the shower.' It seemed to help but I thought too soon, she looked at me and asked, `why you sweating so bad?' Quick as possible I responded, `did you not notice its hot as balls in here?' This must have worked perfect because she finally got me off her mind and said, `YEAH WHO TURNED UP THE HEAT.' I responded, `dad probably, you know I don't touch that sh**!'



----RELIEF



T:2:00

I sat down and decided with the mixture of the Valium with the meph wasn't such a bad idea, I did feel relaxed \& just good, like all my problems were lifted for awhile. If only the world right now knew what I felt like then it would be incredible \& a considerably good amount still, but smaller amounts next time, keep it cool\ldots 



All Opinions



Positives:

Cheap Alternative to Other Drugs

Euphoria is Nice \& Intense

Makes You Relax

Talkative

Social

Happy



Negatives:

Overwhelming At First!

Illegal In Most Places

Underestimated

(Sometimes) Lost

Chemical (Bad For Health) but maybe not

Lasts short Periods

Addiction is Very Possible

Burn like Hell When you snort **WARNING**



Conclusion:



Please please please read read read into this product before doing it. DON'T UNDERESTIMATE IT \& depending on body weight I REALLY consider finding out or asking around or at least don't be dumb \& jump into it like I did! Get a scale or something to measure out a desired amount every time. Today was my first time taking it. I don't feel like I could ever be addicted but I could see someone loving this stuff. Stick to Mary Jane if you have too. I think everyone should have \& experience `rolling' around their parents trying not to get caught\ldots NOT.



Thank You for Reading :)



PS: I still feel amazing \& relaxed\ldots .
