\vspace{2mm}
I'm a 22 year old male, 180 lbs, and I am in good mental and physical health.  I'm a fairly experienced user of psychoactive drugs including LSD, LSA, psilocybin (mushrooms), and daily marijuana.



I had done very mild doses of DMT before (probably between 10 and 20 mg). Usually I had experienced mild closed eye hallucinations, some sound distortion, open eye visual distortions, and a sense that my body was being propelled into what can only be described as a void.  Once I had experienced the sensation of flying over a vivid color spectrum with my eyes closed.  These sensations were pennies compared to what I experienced this time.



My friend had about 40 mg of DMT left.  After watching the film `Altered States' he suggested I take the remainder of the crystals in the bag.  I agreed on the condition that he sit in and be my sober trip sitter/shaman.  He created a play list of music for the trip that would set the tone for the journey ahead.  Before taking the DMT I had a slight anxiety about the large dose, but I was also incredibly excited to attempt the `break through'.



The crystals were placed on top of a minuscule amount of marijuana at the bottom of the pipe in order to keep the crystals anchored in the bowl.  I took my first hit and inhaled deeply.  I waited for 5 seconds, exhaled, and already I was feeling the effects.  I took another deep inhalation and when I exhaled the sound of the music seemed to be clipping to the beat.  One last hit and I put the pipe down with approximately 1/5th of the bowl still unused.



I sat back on the couch and closed my eyes.  I saw 2 vivid figures.  One seemed to be a dragon-like entity with tentacles at the bottom of the chin.  The other entity was further back and all I remember was red eyes.  The two figures seemed to realize I was looking at them and started to come closer in an aggressive manner.  I began to fear for my safety and decided to open my eyes where I gazed upon the stucco ceiling.



I wish I could tell you approximately what time I began looking at the ceiling but time was no longer a part of reality for me.  I was peaking and I had broken through for the first time.  The ceiling began to form patterns at first, then whole characters, the details becoming finer and finer as I focused on them.  Then, to the music, the characters began to dance.



The show in the ceiling could be compared to a circus.  It seemed thoroughly rehearsed but there was no real plot to the madness.  I would see a woman dressed as a jester slowly spinning, and then some other character would lead a small troupe of dancers in front of her as she faded away.  It went on like this for a while, characters either combining with the new characters or simply taking their exit.  The highlight of the show was the dancing Buddha.



The music had taken on a slow sexy groove when I noticed the Buddha sitting in his classic pose.  All the other characters had gone at this point.  He opened his eyes, stood up, and started to belly dance.  I completely lost it at this point and could not help but laugh hysterically.  He pointed at me during a small stop in the music and winked seductively.  More hysterical laughter ensued.



Buddha took a bow and pranced `offstage' and I noticed that the ceiling had become completely calm again.  According to my friend, I had been tripping for no more than 12 minutes by this point.  So, I decided to take the remaining DMT from the bowl.



I took the rest in one giant hit.  I held it in for as long as possible.  Just then, a song by Muse came on.  I closed my eyes and saw a great yellow and green orb of light with a brightness of which I had never seen before.  I reached out for the orb and it seemed to take me an eternity to reach the center.  I grabbed the center of the orb and slowly began to turn my hand.  The orb rocked to the side as if willed by my hand.  I played with the orb for what seemed like several hours but in reality had only lasted as long as the single song.



When I opened my eyes I felt completely sober and back to normal.  It's safe to say that this particular DMT trip was the most intense hallucinogenic experience of my life.  I would do it again in a heartbeat.
