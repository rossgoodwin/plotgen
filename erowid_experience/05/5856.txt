Here's a short recounting of my getting to know 2C-B.

 

1) I started at 10mgs one evening.  I had a partner and a couple of movies. After about 90 mins, I felt pretty much nothing.  Perhaps I felt like I had downed a quick couple of mountain dews or something, a sort of non specific restlessness. No visuals, a little stomach weirdness.  No noticeable mood lift.  No change in the experience of music.



2) The next time I tried 15mgs.  The experience was very much the same, with an increased amount of stomach gurgling.  It seemed like my intestines dumped more water into their system and stuff sloshed and gurgled uncomfortably for a couple hours.



3) Next I went to 25mgs.  This time at about 45 mins in, I started to feel distinctly `strange'.  I was trying to bottle some beer (!?) as I came up and it started to seem a little unmanageable, but I was able to finish without incident.  My partner had taken 12.5mgs (she is quite sensitive to materials in general) and she was feeling more effects than I.  We lay in the middle of the floor and turned on a couple different CDs to see if we could discern any music-effects.  I wasnt able to find any, but she reported that she was abnormally aware of the effect of rotating her head and the change in the depth perception of the sound.  I tried this, lying in the sweet spot ahead of the speakers and rotating my head.  I noticed `something' but not much.  A very mild mood lift (perhaps similar to 1.5 beers or a single medium hit of green bud).  No visuals.  I definitely had a sort of `unpleasant stimulated' feel.  Like too much caffeine, but not.



4) I was unimpressed, but the opportunity to work with it again came up and a couple months later I tried again.  This time at 15mgs.  I had decided that I was interested in `working with' the chemical instead of trying to get my head blown off.  `Perhaps its just subtle for me', I thought.  My partner was not interested at all, given her experience.  About 90 mins in, I felt strong effects starting.  The music changed dramatically.  My headspace opened up.  Strong mood lift: I was giggling and smiling like a happy fool :) My partner lay in front of me and read while I just listened to music and enjoyed the contact between our bodies.  The visuals were medium strong, cycling, shifting geometries of color.  I would say the predominant colors were reddish and greenish.  We got up and went for a walk in the dark and I felt mildly `drunk'. A path I knew well enough to walk in total darkness I was not able to navigate and I stumbled about, laughing at myself.  I giggled and laughed and had a great time.  The visuals were strong enough that they overlayed the darkness so it made it difficult to see subtle features. Definitely strong enough, nice mental effects, with only a twinge of stomach stuff. After I came down, I was far too stimulated to sleep and I spent the next several hours cleaning my kitchen waiting to be tired.



5-15) After that, my work with 2C-B changed and I was much more able to work with it as a relationship to be cultivated.  I've spoken to a number of people who say they `need' 30-60 mgs of 2C-B to really enjoy it, so people's reactions vary, but I think there is value in learning how to find the substance at lower levels.. not the least reason is that 15mgs goes 4 times into 60 mgs.



Over the next 10 trials with 2C-B I chose between 10 and 25 mgs and eventually found that I was most enjoying 16-19mgs.  The strongest experience I had with it was at 10mgs on a full stomach several hours after a sweat lodge.  I was overwhelmed by a sort of neurotic, agitated, stimulated state where I could not settle down, couldn't relax.. I was sorta enjoying it, but I very much wanted to relax and settle in.. I tried breathing techniques and meditation, but my mind just ran amuck.  weird.



Most of my experiences at the 16-19 level have been characterized by medium CEV and OEV.  Music changes.  75\% of the time I get stomach discomfort strong enough to be irritating and I was loathe to take 2C-B if I don't know I'm going to have access to a toilet I won't mind sitting on.  I got diarrhea about 1/3 of the time.  A strong mood lift, a sense of well being, a sense of mental stimulation.  Sometimes I felt very much like talking, while others I had nothing I wanted to speak and instead people found me somewhat non responsive.  



At 12mgs I first noticed that I get a distinct red-green shift / aura around things in dimly lit areas.  It looks vaguely like the world has been put through a cheesy 3D-red-green glasses filter.



Overall, 2C-B was a very good material with a number of mild, but present, side effects.  It can be both very strong and very subtle with the same material at the same dose.



Occasionally people talk about the variability between experiences they have is due to 2C-B degrading or changing between experiences. 2C-B is supposedly remarkably stable.  I have talked to reliable informants who say that they have kept 2C-B in a variety of conditions for a number of years without significant degradation.  (One had mixed it with water, carried it around in a bottle for a few months, and then froze it for 2 years, after which it felt fully potent.)
