In previous experiences, I have found that consuming JWH-018 results in an enjoyable euphoria, somewhat like marijuana, but only lasting for a little while, a couple hours max, and only once before had I had a `bad trip' on it, but never anything like what happened last night. 



A little background:



After hanging out with my family during the day (drinking, smoking many cigarettes), I decided to head on over to my brother's house to maybe smoke a little with him, watch some tv, and then crash. He and I have smoked a lot together, but with the recent unavailability of herbal incense or potpourri, we'd been pretty dry for a while. Then he tells me that he's got some of it again, but in the pure powder form. Unlike before, this stuff is best vaporized in order to maximize the effectiveness and ease of consumption. At the point where I start smoking with him, I've already had a few drinks (maybe 5 or 6 beers), and admittedly not enough water during the day. 



The way in which we vape the stuff is by putting a small amount (he doesn't have a powder scale, so I'm not incredibly sure how much) on a piece of tin foil, holding a flame under the foil and breathing in the resulting smoke from the substance through a section of skinny plastic pipe. The method worked really well, though as a relatively inexperienced drug user, I had never used this method before. \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:NOT\_WEIGHED\#\# 



So my brother loads up what I can assume to be about 3 milligrams of the substance onto the foil, lights it, and I inhale it. Usually with this chemical, I feel the effects immediately. Not this time. This time, I wait about 2 or 3 minutes, feel nothing and decide I should take another hit. This time, he loads what I can assume to be about 5 milligrams, and vapes it as I inhale. As a marijuana user, I've trained myself to hold smoke in for as long as possible, so I hold it in for a good 5 seconds, even though I felt the effects immediately after inhaling. This was not a good idea. 



The immediate effects of JWH-018 can be described (for me, at least) as a sudden lightness, followed by a feeling of slight disconnect from reality. This time, the lightness was very strong, so I stood up immediately and set about trying to keep myself physically occupied by going to the kitchen (about 5 feet away) and getting a glass of water. I got to the kitchen, but before I could get my water, my brother started talking to me. For my brother and me, conversations while high have been some of the most engrossing, so I ditched the water and started chatting.



Standing there, chatting with my brother, it really started to hit me. I began to feel as if I might fall down, not to mention I was almost completely incapable of actually holding a conversation. My legs started shaking, so I sat down on the couch, still trying desperately to understand whatever my brother was trying to tell me. Eventually my conversation dropped off and I was left sitting there on the couch. I started to feel very sick, so I laid my head back and closed my eyes, only to have vibrant and sickening colors apparently flash beneath my eyelids. I opened my eyes, sat up, and immediately went to the bathroom. I locked the door (not sure why, I guess I just didn't want my brother to see me throwing up), and knelt in front of the toilet and tried to throw up. Nothing came out, so I decided to lay on the floor of the bathroom. Then I began to think: `If I black out here, my brother will probably have to break the door down once he realizes where I am and that I'm unresponsive.' Then I realized that I was covered in sweat, and my body was incredibly hot. 



I got up, left the bathroom and went straight to my brother and tried to tell him what was going on and what I was feeling, but I instead jumbled my words together into what must have been an incomprehensible smudge of words. I do remember, however, being able to express to him that I was covered in sweat, so he told me to sit down on the couch. I turned to go to the couch, but on my way, I briefly lost consciousness and tripped, landing directly in front of it, sitting. I came to reality with my brother telling me repeatedly to get up onto the couch, so I pulled myself up and sat there, feeling like utter shit, with vague ideas that I was going to die running through my head. My brother gave me some ice to put on my forehead, and turned on the ceiling fan above me. I laid my head back and forced myself to endure the vivid CEVs and associated sickness. Eventually the terrible feelings started to subside and I slowly drifted off to sleep. 



When I woke up and lifted my head, the feelings came back, and I felt like I really needed to be doing something to take my mind off it. My brother saw that I had woken up and asked if I wanted to go for a car ride, something we do often when the effects of the drug simmer down enough to permit it. I responded that I was not feeling up to it, and we settled on have a cigarette. Upon pulling in the first drag, I felt sick again, and decided that I should forgo finishing the cigarette. I went back inside and passed out again (it was at about 11:30 PM at this point, about my usual bedtime). I woke up a couple times during the night either cold from the fan or hot from the blanket, and I just couldn't seem to get comfortable enough to permit deep sleep which is usually easy on this drug. When I awoke the next morning, I still felt delirious and slightly outside my head, but good enough to drive home. Slight feelings of tiredness, wooziness and general discomfort in my skin persisted throughout the rest of the day. 



I do not intend for this writeup to be anything more than an informative tale of my experience with JWH-18. It can be a fun drug, inducing great feelings of highness akin to a marijuana high, and generally make me more interested in whatever task being performed. As I found out recently, I have an upper limit on how much I can consume. It will be a while before I partake in the drug again, but I do plan on it. T
