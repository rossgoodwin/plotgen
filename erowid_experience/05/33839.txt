Having previously had an exceptionally good time combining DXM + 2C-i, and also a rather hardcore but very worth while DXM + 2C-C trip, I decided to try yet another stab in the dark DXM combination. This time I figured my 2C-T-4 was long overdue an airing having been bottled up for almost a year.

For the record I am in my mid-20's, this trip took place in the evening of what had been a very lazy Sunday.



I began by having a regular dose of motion sickness medication, I have about a 70\% puke rate with DXM that seems to be unrelated to the dose. An hour later I took a gel cap of 10mg of 2C-T-4.



Just over an hour later I began to feel the 1st alerts of the 2C-T-4 and so I took my other cap which contained 340mg of DXM..



An hour after that I noticed the 1st real effects. Despite the fact that my head felt crystal clear, I was having some fairly clear OEVs, just the typical fractal patterns and not especially prominent, but definately there. As it happens this was the visual peak of the trip, it seemed to me that, most unexpectedly the DXM dampened the 2C-T-4's OEVs and the 2C-T-4 dampened the DXM's CEVs.. For the majority of this trip, visuals were a very mild background feature that drew no attention.



At this point I began listening to some Future Sound Of London CDs. Here came another odd thing, for me, as for many, DXM has much the same effect on music as Weed, it makes every piece of music sound very damn good indeed, yet on this occasion this effect was certainly muted. Instead of being swept away by the sound as I'd usually expect from DXM, I had more a sense of an increased analytical appreciation of the muisc. In time I found myself listening very closely and certainly enjoying it a great deal, eventually this got me up and dancing (in my kitchen). This is actually pretty odd, very few drugs make me want to dance, I like dancing sober, drunk, or on acid, but ecstasy, speed, weed, generally turn me right off dancing. As I was dancing, I felt a sense come over me, it was the feeling like when you're at a really good rave and everyone is locked into the flow of the music, and then you look up and see someone they look straight back at you nod and smile and you know what they mean by this is `yes mate I agree life truly is a beautiful gift init'(cheezy I know but I'm just reporting what I experienced). I felt as if I had very strong external approval for my actions (being dancing in my kitchen whilst trippin). 



When I eventually sat down, I closed my eyes and visualised (with my imagination not CEVs) a little cartoon version of myself and a few other ravers continuing to dance to the music, it was very cute and fun. In time I began to be hit by wave after wave of an intense feeling of peace and tranquility, I was more relaxed in this moments than I think I ever have been at least in my whole adult life. I was amazed at how powerful the sense of tranquility was, I'd always considered such feelings to be mild by nature, but the intensity of this sense of peace was about the same the sense of maddening pleasure I get when I snort 5-MEO-DMT.



From the (above) point of sitting down from dancing I was just absorbed in the experience for well over an hour, external distractions faded, this would have been about 4 hours after taking the 2C-T-4 and 3 after the DXM, so I'd guess the peace waves were the primary character of the peak.



When the intensity subsided enuf to re-interest me in the outside world I decided it was time to check out the DVD I had picked out as a possibility for viewing during this trip. This was `Jam' by Chris Morris, a comedy series from the UK. I'd never seen it before, but had heard it generally described as dark, disturbing and subversive. It hardly seemed an appropriate follow-up to the earlier part of the trip, but I figured I'd go ahead and watch it anyway, maybe it could provide a stark contrast. It was twisted, but also very thought provoking, and certainly served to maintain a trippy atmosphere, though i can't say that it was very funny and I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone else to watch it for the 1st time whilst trippin because I think it reeked of bad trip territory.



This took me through to dawn, and on the 1 hand I was wide awake with a whirling mind, but on the other hand I just wanted to call it a day and get some sleep. I spent the next few hours drifting in and out of bed, then the hours after that drifting in and out of sleep. When I woke in the afternoon I felt no worse than I would have from just staying awake all night sober. Certainly had a lack of apetite the rest of the day, even now 24 hours after the peak of the trip I've yet to eat a proper meal, though I snacked pretty steadily from the latter part of the trip until now.



Overall this was a very interesting trip, and in many places quite enjoyable. I was certainly suprised at the way that the DXM and 2C-T-4 interacted, seemed to end up with an odd combination of effects. I would consider doing this again, but not as a high priority, the only strong draw would be the incredible sense of peace I felt at the peak.
