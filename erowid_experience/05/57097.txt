I am 25 years old, 5'10 in height, 140lb in weight. I've been using ecstacy for a while now and will most likely continue to use it in small amounts on occasion. I have found my experiences that I have had under it's influence to be life-altering. I had been curious about the drug from a long time, I'd heard great and fun things about it. After doing months of reading and research, and being able to find a regular supplier, I tried it for the first time with 2 of my best friends, who have used it in the past. As good friends do, they made sure that I was 100\% ok to try it, they had warned me about teeth-grinding, sweating, etc. I made my decision and rolled with them for the first time. 



The experience was fantastic. We each took 2 pills, 2 hours apart, and carefully kept eyes out for each other. (Reminding to drink water, etc\ldots ) We were prepared for it all - pacifiers, gum, lollipops, vapor-rub - the whole nine yards. I am glad that my first experience with ecstasy was enjoyable. I did notice though that I got, and still get ``droopy-eyes'' towards the end of the roll, especially if there is cannabis involved. I also tend to speak fast normally, and so under the euphoric state of rolling, I tend to speak even faster, but still very clearly, and cohesively. I never felt as if I was out of control. I was even able to control the slight nausea I had briefly after the second pill by simply relaxing, breathing and sitting down. Also, throughout the course of the night, we smoked about 3 blunts, which seemed to bring on the ``roll'' again. 



I did notice however, that as I stared at the walls while laying in bed during the end of the come down, they seemed to have a texture, millions of little cracks running through the walls. Sometimes they'd be there, sometimes they weren't. It didn't alarm me at all surprisingly, and so I never paid much more attention to that. I eventually fell asleep.



However, the reason I am writing this is share my hallucinations I have had while rolling with you. Because ecstasy often has other drugs/stimulants mixed with it, and sometimes no MDMA at all, once I start to roll, I have a pretty good sense about what's going to happen. As far as research can tell me, pure MDMA does not cause hallucinations. I'm pretty sure I've taken pills that had no MDMA in them, but had a lot of other things in it, and so it's the other drugs and their effects that I am curious about, and obviously quite sensitive to. Just last night my best friend and I used ecstacy and cannabis. We always roll together, and though there have been other people who have rolled with us on other occasions, it's usually just him and I. I have tried to keep this report as detailed, but as also as uncluttered as possible. I have listed the events as accurately as I can and hope that they might answer or even provide some insight to your own personal experiences with ecstacy.



Shortly after 10pm, we took out first pill after smoking a blunt together. The pills were reddish-brown in color, (had tiny speckles of white) and each were marked with ``XXX'' on one side. They seemed to be a little larger than other pills I have tried, such as pink-hearts. We both then headed off to our local watering hole (bar) to kick it back and relax. While we were there, we each had 2 drinks over the course of an hour and a half, however, we had eaten sufficiently that day. Within an hour, I already showed signs of rolling - dilated pupils, sweating and minor imbalance at one point. Soon, we were both coming up rapidly, and decided to leave to go to another bar.  



At approximately 11:40pm, we arrived at our destination, greeted everyone we knew, and grabbed some drinks at the bar. We spent some time playing games on their gaming machines, photo-hunt etc. We scored our usual number 1 and 2 spots on the machines, which was a little surprising given that I had ``champagne for the eyes'' as one person has put it. Eyes seem to flutter around rapidly, really making my vision seem sparkly, not as if a room is spinning around me. Anyways, not long after that, at around 12:30am, we took our second pill (Same kind). We were rolling really pretty hard at this point, enjoying ourselves, spending time with our housemate, singing while I played the piano, and feeling the need to walk around a lot, which is usual for the two of us. We walked around the neighborhood twice, stopping in at the park near the house to play on the swings. We also smoked another blunt sometime around then (1am) and then again at 2:30am. 



It wasn't until later, around 4:30am or so, we had left the black light on in the bathroom after smoking a blunt with the shower running on hot to make the bathroom steamy and warm. With regular re-hydration, I usually need to pee a lot, and needed to pee quite urgently. At this point, I was wearing only a pair of sweater pants. As I was peeing, I looked at myself in the mirror. The black light was the only source of light in the room. I noticed that I had thousands of tiny little green dots on me. I thought I had gotten something white splattered on me and the black light was simply illuminating them. Without getting freaked out, I simply stretched out my left arm in front of me. (Not looking in the mirror) There were no green or white dots. I called for my friend who came into the bathroom to me. I explained to him what I was seeing (and still seeing) and he seemed pretty cool with it, but he didn't see it. I wasn't getting upset by it either, even after I was done peeing, I stood in front of the mirror to look at the dots which now, were moving and changing to a very dark color and making groups patched over my body.  



I was not scared at all because I was with my best friend, and I had read a bit about hallucinations, and the two of us trust each very, very deeply. I know that he would have taken care of me and done what was necessary to ensure that I was alright if the situation called for it. However, today, I couldn't stop thinking about the hallucinations. This was, I think, the clearest hallucination I have ever had. Other experiences before this were seeing people who seemed larger than life appearing in bushes and doorways, but not for long, nor very clearly or detailed either. Though, none of them ever hurt or frightened me, I was aware that things like this do happen. There was no interaction with it - it was simply just there.



On a post note: one of my particularly favorite hallucinations occurred while I was using ecstacy and trying to read something on the computer screen. The letters on the screen seemed to be three dimensional. I felt as if my vision had zoomed in on the screen and the letters seemed as large as me, and each one had an iridescent quality to it - they seemed to shimmer. If I were to say which my scariest hallucination was, it was probably the people appearing in bushes and doorways. But even that, on a scale of 1-10, was 2 in scariness - pretty mild, I think compared to people who feel bugs crawling on them. I think though that I will always look back on seeing myself with all those greenish dots with a sense of wonder and astonishment. That was a very cool experience for me.
