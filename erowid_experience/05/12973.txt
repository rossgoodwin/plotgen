This experience was the worst I've ever heard about Marezine. 



It all started out about midnight. It was a sucky autumn night, chilly and all. I heard from a guy at the bus stop whom I told I like to trip DXM that I should try Marezine. He told me to take a whole box of the stuff but I thought that 12 pills was a bit much so I looked up Marezine dosage on the internet. It said for my body weight and a first-timer, to take between 4 and 8. So I took 6. About an hour later, I experience a drastic mood change. My emotions hit the highest point I've ever experienced on a legal drug. Much like morning glories actually.



Then it all hit rock bottom. About 2 AM, I forgot I took any of them at all! I looked at the box and it looked unopened to me so I thought I must have dreamed the whole emotion thing. Anyway, I opened the box up for the second time and pulled out the sheet of those little pills. It looked full! I saw 12 tiny little white pills in there! So I took out 6 and popped them. About an hour later, I was so messed up that I couldn't think straight. My brain felt as though it was no longer there. Then the hallucinations hit me. I looked at the ceiling and it started to dance around. Not the kind of dancing you want, mind you. It looked as though it was melting on me and it scared the crap out of me!



I turned on the tv for awhile and I can't even remember what was on. I believe that I was watching xena or something. Anyway, my vision turned black and I became dizzy. I fell into some sort of trance and even though my eyes were closed, I could still see my room and the tv! I think that the Marezine forced my third eye chakra to open which, in itself, could be very dangerous. Anyway, I got up to go to the bathroom like every half hour. I looked in the mirror and my pupils were the size of marbles! I literally couldn't see any color in my eyes. When I went back into my room, I was laying in bed and I picked my hand up and looked at it. Remember the jiggling on the ceiling? Well, my hands started jiggling and at first it looked cool. Then I got scared when I started seeing a clear jelly around my arms. Next thing I knew, these intricate bacteria-looking things began growing out of the jelly! I freaked out majorly and I couldn't help but keep staring. It was as if I had no control over my body.



Sometime during this experience, I felt as though I stopped breathing. I became unnerved by this and it literally scared the crap out of me! I thought I was going to die and I regretted the experience totally. I got out of my bed finally and took my eyes off my body and the things stopped growing. Then I turned around and looked in my bed were I had been laying. There was the jelly again! Only this time, it looked like mold grew on it. Rapidly too. It seemed like only seconds had gone by with each full growth. I ran through the house yelling for my grandma (who had no idea what was going on) to get up. I made up this story about a girl at work putting it in my drink and telling me after the fact that she had put it in SOMEONE's drink but was not specific as to who. I told her that I was having horrible hallucinations of viruses and bacteria, etc. She became frightened as well. She went in the other room to talk to my grandpa and as I was sitting in the living room, I saw the simpsons appear on the wall and I was watching as though it was a tv show. That was the high point of the trip.



Next thing I knew, we were on our way to the hospital and I don't really remember the events leading up to it other than my mom being called and told to meet us there. In the emergency room, things mellowed out. They didn't pump my stomach because the ingestion happened too long ago. The nurse and the doctors all had never heard of a Marezine overdose and nobody even seemed to know what Marezine even was! Anyway, they hooked me up to a heart monitor and I became freaked out again as I realized that my heart was not beating normal. According to the monitor, my heart rate all across the chart was a steady pyramid when it should have been spiky and different sized. They drew my blood and tested me for drugs, etc. I came up clean (luckily) because I hadn't done anything for a long time. Anyway, I started feeling like I was going to puke so they gave me one of those gold plastic things. I started to move it around and I saw a gold powder moving around and I started to play with it. My mom started yelling at me to stop saying that there was nothing there but it was as if I didn't hear her. To me, it was there and that's all I would believe. It amazed me how I couldn't separate reality from unreality. With LSA and LSD, I could always separate the two. Anyway, they let me go home about 7 AM and I went to my mom's house.



I was still hallucinating at this point and heavily. I began to see spiders and bugs crawling all over the couch and I flipped out. It was as if I was having a nervous breakdown or something! Anyway, everyone tried to convince me that it was all in my head but I just wouldn't listen.



Finally about 12 noon, I fell asleep for about 2 hours. When I awoke, I began hallucinating immediately. I saw a little girl standing next to my mom's work desk. I began to talk to her, asking her what her name was and what she was doing there. She told me that my mom was babysitting her and I believed her. When I got up to get a closer look at her, she just disappeared! Weird, I thought. So I went and sat down on the couch. Then I saw a woman leaning over my little sister and then her brother and sister (who weren't in the house and I knew it) appeared next to her. Finally, she disappeared and so did the `ghost kids' as I call them today. By this point, I was beginning to gain control of the trip. I figured out that if I close my eyes and imagine an object appearing and being solid, when I opened my eyes, I would see it and I could pick it up and play with it. This is when the trip became a bit more fun. I created safety pins and tweezers, a thermometer and a computer which I proceeded to play with until I got bored. Then all the hallucinations disappeared and I felt VERY drained. As a matter of fact, I felt almost as drained as I do when I crash on ephedrine. Anyway, the hallucinations gradually subsided and I returned to `normal' by 8 PM that night.



For a trip that was supposed to last 4 to 6 hours, it lasted almost 24!



All in all, I would say that Marezine is very dangerous: 



Physically, it blocks histamines and has strong anticholinergic effects.



Mentally, it induces a kind of psychosis where you can't separate real from unreal and you also feel things that you shouldn't be feeling. For example, you CAN feel pain from your hallucinations! 



Finally, spiritually, it can do much more harm than help. Forcing open the third eye chakra, for example, can bring highly unwanted visions into your everyday life. Also, you could lose faith completely simply because you can't tell what is real and what isn't. 



Generally speaking, I wouldn't mess with marezine ever again if my life depended on it!!! Its too much of a risk!
