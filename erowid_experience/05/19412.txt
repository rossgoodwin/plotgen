I went to a rave one Saturday night with some friends: J, E, and W (all guys except me).  We hung out at my place first, getting ready and drinking lots of orange juice.  We also took Vitamin C pills.  We ate a very light dinner before leaving.  



It took about an hour and a half to drive to the rave.  We stopped at a gas station a mile or so from the site and took the ecstasy there. We each had a double stack.  A friend of ours made them.  We got to the rave and hung out for about 15-20 minutes.  I started feeling sort of an anxious/nervous feeling in my stomach, but in a good way.  That's the first feeling of the ecstasy.  After feeling like that for a bit, I got lots of energy and went out on the dance floor to dance.  We popped out glow sticks and got after it.  



On ecstasy, I don't `lose myself.'  I know where I'm at, what I'm doing, and I don't lose my inhibitions.  It's just a pure high.  I felt as if all of my senses were as one.  Even outside of me - the music, the lights, the other people, they all felt like a part of me.  It felt as if every sensation I had was positively multiplied and synchronized with my other senses.  A truly amazing experience within myself (and not an `out-of-body purely spiritual psychadelic experience).



It took about an hour to get to the peak of the high.  The peak is such an intense feeling of positive energy that I could hardly contain myself.  I wanted everyone to be able to enjoy this euphoria.  Our peak high lasted about four hours.  (The pills we had that night were very intense, but not as long-lasting as other pills I'd had.)  At that point, I could feel myself coming down a little bit.  



Coming down is weird.  I am still a part of that amazing sensational wonderland, but I start to catch glimpses of what the `normal world' is like, too.  I was just going along, dancing or whatever, and I'd realize, `this doesn't feel quite as good as it did an hour ago.'  And then I'd be back at it again.  It was a slow come-down, but it didn't *feel* slow\ldots  Finally, one time when I realized that it didn't feel quite as good as before, I just didn't go back to feeling great again.  Be prepared, because that's a real let down.



It was enough of a let down for me that night that I went looking for more drugs.  I found a guy who had a capsule of AMT.  He offered to give it to me if I'd give him a ride home.  I didn't know him, but I figured, what the hell, I'll do it.  I took the capsule and the night went downhill from there.



I had done ecstasy several times before, but never AMT.  I didn't really know what to expect - perhaps if I had, it wouldn't have been so freaky.  It took forever to set in, and I started to think the guy I got it from got a free ride home.  About an hour and 15 minutes after I took it, I started feeling sick to my stomach.  I went outside and threw up a little bit.  My other friends, who had come down from the X and didn't get more pills, were all ready to go home, so we left.  We stopped at a gas station before leaving town, and I threw up *really bad*.  When I came out of the bathroom, the whole gas station was spinning and I felt like I was walking through another dimension - one that nobody else could ever be a part of.  



Back in the car for the hour and a half `trip' home, I saw what looked like rainbow-striped water droplets falling onto the windshield and blowing back over the top of the car.  That was really cool.  I also saw buildings that weren't really there.  None of that was really freaky.  I felt a little bit out of it, and just stared at the road most of the way home.  



When we pulled up at my apartment an hour and a half later, I hardly knew where I was.  I knew `This is my apartment,' but it seemed so grossly different that I was almost sure I must have been wrong.  As soon as I stood up, I felt very sick and almost threw up again.  E and W went home.  I just stood outside my door for a while until J came to get me and take me inside.  That's when it got freaky.



I couldn't walk quite right - I was very slow and off-balance.  I laid down on my bed and tried to close my eyes to get away from the feeling and the visuals, but it was all there when I closed my eyes, too - maybe worse.  I saw a man in the corner, and screamed for J to help me.  He didn't understand.  When he said that no one was there, it didn't help - it made it worse.  It made me more afraid of the man who was coming to get me, and J couldn't save me because he didn't even know the man was there.  



I fell off the side of my bed.  As I was lying there, I felt my body slipping away\ldots   It felt like the physical matter of my body was melting away and being poured out through a funnel.  I was dripping out on the other side, and I didn't know where my body was going\ldots  that really scared me.  



Everything turned a distgusting shade of peuk-green.  I didn't know what was real and what wasn't.  Every few minutes I would scream at J (who was trying to go to sleep), `Are you real?  I need to know!  Where are you?  Are you here?  Are you real?  I need to touch you!'  And if he didn't respond, I grew more desperate and fearful that even the one thing I had to keep me sane was not real, and I would be crazy forever.  



I began to think (realize) that if I stayed inside, I would surely suffocate and die, so I hurried for the front door.  I ran outside and was about to take off down the street when J caught me and tried to pull me back to the house.  I screamed and told him that I would die if he took me back in there, and that I needed to be free.  He didn't listen, so I thought he was in on the plot against me.  As he was falling asleep, I tried to run away again.  He heard the door open, and chased me down again to bring me inside.  



After *several* hours of this, I started coming down a little bit.  That wasn't as creepy to me - I think as a `first-timer' with a psychadelic drug I needed a lower intensity.  It was still a long time - another several hours - before I got to sleep, and when I finally did, it was wonderful.  



I think the main reason my experience with the AMT was so scary for me was that it was the first time I had done anything besides ecstasy or weed.  I had no experience with psychadelic trips, and I really didn't know what to expect.  J (the person I was with) also had never had experience with these, so he didn't know what to do either.  Looking back, the experience wasn't all bad.  I think a different situation would have helped immensely.  I would try it again, but I would definately do things differently.



I would take the AMT first (before the X) and be in an environment with other people who were tripping.  As I started coming down from the AMT, I'd take the ecstasy.  That way, the first part of my experience (the AMT) I would be lost in another dimension and finding new things, and in the last part of the experience, I would be happy and could share my previous experience with other people.
