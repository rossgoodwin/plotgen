July 2009 - 400mg Tramadol, 200/1300mg Propoxyphen 100-650, 1500ml. Cabernet Sauvignon Red Wine / Alcohol



41 year old male.  215 pounds.  Exercise / swim once or twice a week.  Drink beer or wine 4-5 days of the week, smoke only on those 4-5 days of drinking.  



Past drug use - Marijuana daily from age 17 until 38.  Quite cold turkey three years ago (only after meeting my wife who doesn't smoke).  While she didn't ask that I quit I decided it would be better that I did to better align with her lifestyle.   Have dropped LSD 4 or 5 times, yet 20 years ago.  Enjoyed mushrooms about a dozen times (again, 20 years ago and then grew and used some of my own 10 years ago for just a few trips before having enough.)   Used crank a few times (again 20 years ago) that was fun.  Used cocaine for a few months (about 8 years ago) and quit cold turkey.   Pharms - None ever really.   So in truth drug free for three years plus and if you don't include MJ, 8 years and no opiates for 20 years.



So why the hell did I decide to take Tramadol?  Just for fun and two days of hell later I wish I never had. Here's my report in hopes that it will help someone else prevent whatever happened to me.  



So I get a wart on my foot from a public pool, have to have it removed so the foot Doctor gives me some Cephalxin (antibiotic) to start taking a few days before the minor surgery.   Then he asked if I am feeling pain which I was and still am, but not so bad that I would take a pain killer for it.   Yet when asked that question the drug enjoyer inside me woke up and realized, I can get some legal pain killers.  Why not, sounds like fun and I don't recall taking any pain killers in years, don't even remember the last time, if ever for that matter.   



5 am Monday.  Start out with some red wine while doing email.  I am not supposed to be drinking alcohol with pain relievers as they make them stronger, and I know that.   This could have very possibly been what caused my reaction which we are getting to.   Total wine consumed over 15 hours was (2) 750ml bottles or about 8 large glasses.  Not quite enough to become legally intoxicated.  



Introduce the narcotics;



1 PM - (4) 50mg (200mg) Tramadol Tablets, (2) Propoxyphen 100-650 capsules (200mg Propoxyphen - 1300mg Acetomenophen)

8 PM - (4) 50mg (200mg) Tramadol Tablets



That was Monday.  At the time of this writing it is 11am Wed and it is the first time I can get out of bed and stand up for any length of time, eat without vomiting or be able to sit up at the laptop and stay awake without getting massively dizzy.  I don't know if this was an allergic reaction, near overdose or too much with alcohol but I suspect the alcohol played a strong role.   Here's the timeline; 



01:00 pm Monday - Feeling pretty good after having a few glasses of red wine during the morning, securing a bottle of Tramadol (and an accidental prescription to Propoxyphen 100-650 which I returned after taking 2).   Looking forward to enjoying some Tramadol, a legal high at home (or so I thought).  



Took 200mg with water and another glass of wine.  



02:00 Starting to feel dizzy, certainly no pain as the stoned feeling made me forget that my foot hurt.  Even if my foot hurt I think I could just grin and bear it at this point.  Very heavy sweating. I was pouring sweat so badly that my hair was stuck to my head, shirt soaked, sweat getting in my eyes.   Had to keep a towel handy.  Also started to notice problems urinating as when I needed to go it was just very slow.  While I had not eaten anything yet that day, I was suddenly not hungry, also lost interest in the wine I was sipping and cigarettes became less enjoyable.  All I wanted to do was stare at the computer screen and read something interesting, so I web surfed for about 5 hours.  I was most certainly not feeling any pain at all, do recall laughing a bit in the wonderment of the power of drugs that I can get for such a trivial reason, as stated, I really didn't need these at all. Somehow I totally forgot that I had not eaten breakfast, lunch or dinner.   My wife came home, I showed her what I was taking and she said I should eat and then go to bed in a while.  She also noted how much I was sweating.  



08:00pm Looking at the clock I realized that I could take another dose so popped (4) more 50mg tablets, washed these down with a glass of wine, went to the kitchen looking for food and I don't remember much else about the evening other than that. I never did make anything to eat, but my wife tells me I went back into the computer and listened to some of my old ZZ Top, Def Leppard and Pink Floyd music on Youtube.  I do know that around 10pm I was getting some massively clear color and graphic hallucinations with my eyes closed.  I was in complete control over three items on a black void background palate and I could morph the items into any shape or color I wanted to instantly.   I sat the right two items aside as not to complicate matters and to focus all creativity on the primary item.  I then broke it down into basic colors of red, blue, yellow and green coloring the 4 sides of a triangular crystal pyramid, replicated hundreds of thousands of these and piece by piece constructed a model palace (which I had recently seen in real life at Presidential library, which was a gift from the President of Saudi Arabia that I had been impressed with). In addition to the visual hallucinations I also had a feeling of floating, time standing still, great heat (and sweating) and unfortunately the entire time, nausea. 



11:00 pm (est) Finally laid down when my wife came to bed.  Still could barely urinate fully.  While I do normally sweat when sleeping, I've never sweated that much in my life.  Soaked the entire bed and pillows.  The main things I can remember was being so glad that my wife was there watching me, because I knew something was wrong, and that nothing felt better to just lay there and sleep, as my legs felt more relaxed than they had ever been in my life.  For much of the night I could feel and hear every breath I took.  While it was not labored or stressful I was worried that I was breathing too loud and might be waking up my wife. I was extremely dehydrated with a throat so dry that it was hard to swallow the constantly needed water.   



Tuesday

09:00am - Got up to take my wife to work real quick.  Ate a small piece of beef roast (with glass of water) on the way out the door (1st thing I had eaten since Sunday)\ldots  Had to use sunglasses to go outside, had to hold the railings on the stairs very hard to keep from falling and I felt dizzy like I was stumbling.  Drove her the two miles to work, came home, went to kitchen to get more breakfast then felt ill and tried to make it to the restroom.  I violently projectile vomited the meat I had eaten 20 minutes earlier, as well as the water.  Could not stand up as I was too dizzy so went back to bed and slept (still sweating) for another 8 hours or so.  



05:00pm Woke up still feeling extremely weak, tired, depressed, dizzy and sick to my stomach.   Made a small bowl of pasta at 6pm and ate half of it without vomiting.  When being awake this time, the pain relievers had worn off so much that I could feel the whole full extent of how badly my body felt.  It was worse than the flu, with that overall hurting, weak feeling and I do remember coming down from meth about 22 years ago, and this was worse or as bad as that.   All I could do was go back to sleep.  I was paranoid that maybe I had damaged my liver, I felt agitated and angry at myself, very let down that I was not smart enough to avoid doing something so stupid and I felt I may have scared my wife. But since I could not stand up there wasn't much more to do than go back to sleep.  I didn't understand how I could still be feeling this bad over 20 hours after the last dose, most of those hours all being sleep.  But I went back to sleep.   



Wed

02:00am.  Realized my wife had come home from work, put a glass of water by me, put away my half eaten food and was laying by me.  Realizing that I was not going to get better if I didn't start eating again, I managed to crawl to the kitchen and eat the rest of my pasta while sitting on the floor.  Extremely dehydrated still I brought a gallon of water back to bed with me and drank as much as I could.  Some luck, the food and water was staying down and I actually started to feel a little better. I felt a little constipated and was unable to pass a bowel.  While soaking in a hot tub of water I discovered that it was not constipation exactly yet the Tramadol seemed to have caused my rectal muscles to tighten up. Relaxing in the hot bath did make it to where I could pass a bowel later.  This seemed to be the same as making it difficult to urinate as if my bladder muscles were too tight, but after soaking in the hot water with Epsom Salt I was able to urinate a little better as well.  3:15 am went back to sleep.



08:00 am - When my wife's alarm clock went off she asked how I was doing and I was pleased to report, `I feel better'.  I can hold food down now, the dizzyness is not entirely gone but I can stand up longer now.  She needs to go to the grocery store tonight and I think I can take her in the car. This will be my first time trying to drive after getting `better'.   But I still feel really, really bad.   Aside from the trips to the store I don't see getting out of bed much except to eat for the rest of this week. I've cancelled everything I had planned, including the foot surgery, to allow for nothing but bed rest for the next 3-4 days.   



09:00 am - I ate a first full meal since Sunday night!   Breaded fish, rice and broccoli with cheese, iced tea and a lot of water.  Two hours later so far so good.   Digestion is working, still too tired to stand up more than 10-15 minutes but the nausea and dizziness are almost gone.  



11:00 am.  Start writing report before going back to sleep.  



11:53 am.  Finish report.



Note - Have noticed an interesting side effect, at least on me.   While I normally have beer or wine and a cigarette after dinner, or larger amounts of beer or wine several times a week, I have not drank alcohol, or smoked, nor wanted any alcohol or cigarettes since this happened Monday.   I just have no desire for either.   



Summary - People, this was not worth it at all for a free legal high. If I had any idea at all that I was going to lose a week of my life laying around in bed feeling horrible I would have never taken it.
