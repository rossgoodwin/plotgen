I used to really be into raves.  I enjoyed the atmosphere.  A bunch of people getting really high and enjoying each others company.  I used to think they were great untill an experience I had in New Orleans one year.

My girlfriend (Danielle), Tuck, Robbie, and myself decided we were going to go see DJ Irene.  Well it was Tucks first rave and he had never rolled on X before either.  Danielle and I had been up for about 3 or 4 days on Meth before the trip.  We decided to get a bag before we left.  The entire way down there all 4 of us smoked Meth out of a hollowed out light bulb.  It was about a 6 hour drive.  Needless to say it was a very talkative 6 hours.  We arrived in N.O. and smoked a blunt between us before we got to the State Palace. 

When we walked in I was very energized and happy.  I was dancing and talking to random people.  I was planning on taking 3 X pills.  Danielle was just going to take one.  Robbie was going to do whatever was available, and Tuck was going to take an X pill for the first time (which in my opinion in the best roll you will ever have.)  Well I ran into my friend, we will call him Matt.  I asked him if he could get any X.  He hugged me and said `I can get fire ass X pills, Cidney(LSD), and Mescalin.' 

Well LSD is probably my favorite drug.  I like Mescalin but didn't think that a rave was necessarily a good environment to do it in.  I believe its more of a spiritual thing, you should enjoy in nature.  Well I decided I was going to do acid.  I told him I just wanted 10 hits of `Cid' for now.  I gave him my money and he ran off.  10 minutes later I ran into him.  We ducked off in the cut and he handed me 10 small squares of tinfoil.  I found Robbie and gave him his hit.  I gave Tuck 2 but he was going to save them for the next day.  I ran to the bathroom and unrapped the tinfoil and put 1 hit under my tongue and 1 on top.  I then found matt again and then told him I wanted two X pills (one for Danielle, and one for Tuck.)  Well 15 minutes later the trip started to kick in.  It was coming on like a normal acid trip except for being all happy and giggly, I was somewhat paranoid.  

Matt had the money and it seemed like he had been gone for like an hour. In reality it was only 20 minutes.  I was wigging out.  Finally Tuck and Danielle calmed me down.  I was starting to get REALLY good visuals, probably some of the best I have had before. I loved it.  Finally I met up with Matt in the laser tag room and he gave me the pills.  He was talking about how bad ass they were.  The were called blue torches.  I gave one to tuck and one to Danielle.  They both took them.  From that point on it was somewhat of a normal rave.  I was looking at the black light paint on the wall and laughing my ass off.  Some guy kept following me around wanting to fill my water bottle up.  It freaked me out.  

I heard him tell Robbie, `That dudes trippin hard, take care of him.'  I didn't really realize how hard I was tripping untill he said that.  At that point I decided Robbie and I should go to the bathroom and look in the mirror.  I love to do that.  While we were doing that some guy I've never seen came in and said `Yall good on Tabs.'  I knew he was talking about X.  I had alot of money so I asked him what he had.  He said he had `blue torches' and `mescalin' pills.  Without thinking I bought one of each.  Robbie and I walked out of the bathroom and I started freakin out.  I said to Robbie `Why did I buy these, I am so wasted already I don't need this.'  Robbie just shook his head and laughed.  I went and found Danielle and asked her what I should do.  She was kinda upset with me.  

I didn't know whether or not to take them.  She said, `Chris, you are so fucked up right now.'  I was like, `yeah I guess youre right.'  Next thing I know my friend Ronnie comes up.  He was trippin too.  I said, `Ronnie I just bought these pills, should I take them or not?'  He said, `Man, It's a party get fucked up!'  Without hesitating I swallowed both of them.  Danielle just shook her head.  Well 20 minutes later a big group of us were just chillin against a wall in the laser tag room.  I started to feel the roll come on.  I was excited at first.  Then something started to happen.  I started to feel like I wasn't in my body.  Not like I was having an out of body experience just some what disociated.  I didn't really like it.  I was telling danielle I couldn't feel my body anymore.  She started getting worried.  Well next thing I know I feel like I'm about to pass out.  I did.  Well what happened next felt like forever.  I went to this state where I didn't know that I was alive.  I didn't know what being alive was.  I didn't know what a human being was.  I was some sort of entity floating around in the large area.  I then woke up.  It felt like eternity, but It was only a couple of minutes everyone later told me.  When I awoke 2 people were in my face asking me if I was okay.  I noticed some people huddled over laughing at something else.  1000 thoughts literaly came into my mind at one time.  It was overwhelming.  The most predominant thought that I had was, `The concept of raves is rediculous.  A bunch of modern day hippies, burnouts, take as many hallucinogenic drugs as possible and huddle in corners listening to repetitive electronic music.'  I didn't like it.  Everything was moving so hard and uncontrollable.  These were the strongest visuals I have ever had.  

The floor was shooting up into spikes and I thought there were bugs flying around everywhere but I realized it was tracers off of peoples fingernails, glowsticks, hair, clothes, everything.  All of this happened in a few seconds.  Next thing I know I stand up screaming uncontrollably.  Loud, scared sreaming.  Ronnie grabbed me and was going to carry me outside.  I kept telling him `Ronnie if I close my eyes I go to a world where I don't know whats going on and I forget what a human being is, and If I open them everything is moving so uncontrollably and shooting at me, I don't know what to do.'  I kept closing and opening my eyes repeatedly trying to stop both things from happening.  He said `you are just trippin man, It will be okay.'  Well when I got outside I couldn't tell if it was day or night.  The sky was purple and the buildings where changing from Light to Dark with multiple colors moving all over them like little demons crawling around.  It was beautiful now that I look back at it.  I then saw my friend Jerry in a car fucking this girl.  

My first thought was, `Why is Jerry reproducing?  He is such a burnout.  We don't need anymore Jerry's.'  I was shaking.  I didn't know what to do.  Next thing I know Danielle comes running out saying `Chris I lost my engagement ring.'  I was so wasted I said, `I don't care, go look for it, if you don't find it we will be okay.'  She ran inside and Tuck and Robbie came out.  Ronnie went back with Danielle to help find the ring.  Tuck and Robbie stayed with me.  We got into my car.  Needless to say I could'nt drive.  Tuck was the only one who could drive a standard.  He said he was great to drive.

 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#  

Well Danielle comes out and she found the ring, Thank God.  I don't know how she did it though.  Well Tuck is trying to get my car started, and this real fucked up guy came up to my window and was trying to get me to roll my window down.  I rolled it down just a little and was like `WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT!' He was all fucked up.  He looked like he was on xanax or something.  He said, `Hey man roll down your window further, Do you guys have anything you want to get rid of?'  I said, `NO GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM MY CAR!'  Well we started going down the road and I started chillin out alot.

I kept telling them what had happened to me.  OVER AND OVER.  Next thing I know I look up at the sky and look at the clouds.  I see these tubes in one of the clouds that are wiggling around like worms.  I then started asking everyone, `Why are there tubes in the clouds?  Do you guys see those tubes?  What do you think those are there for?'  Tuck then reminded me that I was tripping.  I completely forgot I had taken anything.  I looked at the tubes and somehow felt conected.  One of the tubes slowly came down and went directly into my face.  I then `thought' we stopped for gas and some lady was screaming at me to pay before I pump.  Then the tube left and I asked everyone if we stopped for gas.  They all told me we hadn't.

Well I just sat there lost in my own mind and then had a strong urge to smoke pot.  I then said, `Roach blunt smoke lets.'  Everyone started laughing.  I then said, `Laugh what at are Yall?'  I then realized I was confusing my words.  I kept talking like that for 30 minutes.  That has never happened to me.  It was crazy but It started bothering me.  Finally I was able to talk after we smoked some weed.  After that we stopped to get gas.  I tried to then pump first and then the lady accused me of stealing gas, and told me I had to pay first.  It was exactly what happened to me when the tube came down.  I still don't know if maybe my mind just got switched up and turned around and I thought I saw the future, or if I actually did.

Well after that I started coming down and was able to comprehend life better.  I still had pretty strong visuals but I was okay.  We got back to shreveport and It was about 8 in the morning.  We went to a place called wallace lake dam.  Tuck then took his first 2 hits of acid.  We hung out there for a while.  Then I decided we needed some weed.  I went and bought a blunt from a friend of ours.  We then went to a park.  I parked my car.  I rolled the blunt and we all sat there and smoked it while danielle was smoking meth.  She thought she might have a drug test in a couple of weeks so she didn't smoke the weed.

Well runners would pass by my car.  I had 5\% tent on my windows so they couldn't see us, but I had them down enough to let smoke out.  I guess some of the runners smelled it.  Well I left my lights on so my car died.  We had finished the blunt.  Tuck had the roach in his cigarette pack with his hits of acid.  I decided we were going to have to push my car so I could pop the clutch.  Well when we started to do that, 2 cop cars pulled up.  This is when things got really weird.

I don't remember how it started but the cops seperated us.  He then searched us.  They found Tucks blunt roach.  They put him in the cop car. Mind you he is tripping on acid for the first time.  I'm wigging out.  He then told me to tell him what else I had on us.  He didn't find anything on me, but my car was a mess.  I told him there were some seeds and stems probably and that was all.  I knew it wasn't.  He then told me if he found anything else we were all going to jail.  I told him there was a light bulb that we smoked meth out of.  He told me to get it.  When I was in there I grabbed the bulb and slid a bag of weed in my sleeve.  I gave it to him.  Then I notice that they are looking through Tucks cigarette pack again.  They find the Acid.  I knew we were fucked then.

They started questioning him.  I had 5 hits in my wallet at the time.  They asked him were he got it.  He pointed at his wrist band, because it said `state palace' on it.  They said, `You got it from your wrist band?' He was wigging out because he was tripping.  He then tells them I sold him the acid.  I got mad then.  I sneakily got the acid out of my wallet and threw it on the ground.  The guy tries to convince me I'm a drug dealer.  I told him man I'm not a drug dealer.  The guy I got it from isn't a drug dealer, hes just a middle man getting a few hits of acid everynow and then.

The guy then searches my car and finds a baggy full of powder from xanax, seeds and stems, and an opened bottle of Hot Damn 100 proof.  I'm like 18 or 19 too.  It was in the driver side door.  Well Danielle had about half a gram of Meth in her wallet which they never found.  I thought we were all going to jail.  They take Tuck back out of the car and make him sign something.  They then tell me to throw the hot damn, light bulb, and weed all out into the lake at the park.  I did it.  He then told us all to leave.  We couldn't drive though because we `were to high.'  It was crazy!  We should have gotten arrested.  He did keep the acid though, which really was weird.  And Tuck signed something, hmmmmm.

Well we walked to our cars about 6 miles away.  I kept telling tuck he better not have rat on anybody.  Well Danielle and I went to the mall parking lot and snorted the rest of the meth.  I went back to the park, she jumped my car, I got my acid off the ground, and Then she went to her parents and I went to my parents house.  I had about a 45 minute drive.  I was so throwed off in the head.  At one point I looked over and for a split second saw danielle, and she said `Yeah, thats right.  I'm right next to you.'  It scared the shit out of me.

Then I kept thinking I saw this huge mexican climb out of a big truck ahead of me.  I knew I needed sleep bad!  I was then pulling into my parents driveway.  We have this tree with a bunch of branches on it.  I could have swore it was some enormous deer with 10 foot antlers on it.  I wigged out.  I then went inside, didn't say a word to my parents, and went to sleep.  It was crazy, but I wouldn't take any of it back for anything.  :)
