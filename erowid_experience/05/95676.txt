I am writing this from memory as this trip took place a few years back. It was, however, one of the best experiences in my tripping experience thus far, so I remember it quite well.



Once upon a time, my friend T and I had a nice summery Saturday free, so we woke up early, cooked bacon and called up our buddy, P. We wanted this to be no ordinary Saturday so we asked P to dose us on what was at the time a fairly new on the scene research chemical, 2C-P. T and I met P in a park. We were sitting on the park bench and P walked up to us with two oral syringes filled with a solution of 2C-P (mine 12mg and T's 8-10mg or so) and squirted them into our mouths. It tasted like some sort of weir cream soda-like mixture.



As we had a little left over from a previous exploit, I asked P if we should mix the 2C-P with MDMA and some lady walking by us in a stroller responded `No!'



So we decided against taking the MDMA and slowly walked back home. It took us about an hour to get home and I only started to feel any affects about half an hour after that. At this point my headspace started to change and I started to perceive the social vibe of those around me very strangely. I felt somehow excluded from people's conversations and decided to go hang out in the kitchen and read a book for a while. Around two hours after dosing I had almost forgotten about the 2c-p until I noticed the letters being to get very fuzzy and wobbly and reading was no longer very comfortable.



T and I moved upstairs to our tripping spot, which was a room in the attic with a big screen TV, geometry wars, comfy furniture and trippy deco. It had always been one of my favourite rooms but this trip was to change my perception of that room quite a bit. At this point I certainly felt as if something was beginning to be very different about reality, like the feeling around 20 minutes after eating psilocybe mushrooms. At around T+2:30, T was feeling nothing and was starting to suspect the chemicals were bunk so he went into the other room with his girlfriend.



During the time they were away I began to feel very awkward. I felt that I was unwanted and abandoned. I felt third-wheel-ish with my friend in the other room with his girlfriend. Knowing how psychedelics are, of course, I managed to put myself into a trance sort of state, close my eyes and go into myself. There were a few moments of intricately textured, organic looking CEVs, but the trip at this point (now almost 3 hours after dosing) was very non-visual. My headspace, on the other hand, was fucked. Things were very confusing and although visually undistorted my associations with everything in this very familiar room were somehow changed. I perceived emotions in inanimate objects. The window looked like it normally did, but felt as if it was somehow something else. It had a mystical tunnel vibe. And the couch was judging me. 



There was a strong sense of a sort of psychedelic anticlimactic feeling, where everything was so profoundly normal and I was beginning to have some interesting realizations. My associations with all the items in the room around me kept switching and certain items would seem happy, then sad, open then closed. Somehow the pictures on the walls reminded me of apples and the couch now reminded me of cheese, while the window made me think of candles. Time was going extremely slowly at this point but visually thing still looked very `normal.' Eventually I was beginning to understand that normalcy is the trip, that it always has been the trip.



This was around three and a half hours after dosing and I was thinking very hard. Once I realized that all these strange associations had always been there, I went inwards and started to go through hundreds of different thought processes at once. Although very interesting to have one's brain think at such a rate, it made me feel very mentally uneasy, so I decided to dive into the visuals and jumped up to the light switch -- which reminded me of the texture of my pillow -- and turned off the lights. There was a feeling as if time had suddenly started passing more quickly, while my perception had switched back to passing more slowly. My perception slowed down and time sped up until they matched each other somehow and then I opened my eyes and found myself staring out at strange alien shapes covered in organic textures that looked like the cracks and grooves you see in skin and leaves when looked at under a microscope.



For a while I immersed myself in these textures, but I wanted to see something more then that so I again closed my eyes (to avoid the shock) and turned on the light. Now the visuals were truly present. Everything was morphing and swirling and covered in fabulous textures, the walls were breathing and the window really was some sort of mysterious tunnel and, minutes later, the door burst open and T appeared. He told me that his girlfriend had fallen asleep and that he had fallen awake. The 2C-P had NOT been bunk. 



We were both still in a sort of confused state, with our minds trying to analyze too much perception and starting to overflow, so T opened up his laptop and we google searched something about `2C-P' and `chaos' and somehow we came up with all sorts of strange symbols and dischordian imagery. The computer made no sense and, at the same time, we both seemed to look at the whole situation from another perspective and see the silliness of it all. We had been trying to `know' and to understand what was going on around us but it was ineffable. Why had we been trying to analyze that which could not be analyzed? We looked into each others eyes and we both exclaimed with great relief: `I DON'T KNOW!'



We said `I know nothing,' `I don't know at all,' `I don't know,' `I don't know,' `I don't know!' and we repeated that mantra for a few minutes and tumbled onto the floor laughing the most pure psychedelic laughter. I had been having some nausea, discomfort and a lot of tremors, but all of that went away. It felt like an enormous weight had been lifted off my shoulders and for the next several hours we laughed and rolled around on the floor in the psychedelic bliss of acceptance. We were nothing but insignificant humans in this great universe and that was good.



We didn't try to understand anything, we didn't analyze our surroundings, we just were. And being was hilarious. So we laughed. It was good.



Eventually my abs started to hurt and the laughter subsided. By this point it had been at least 8 or 9 hours since the dosage and the peak had surely passed. Now most of the psychedelic mind-state was gone but the visuals were still strong and, as if some sort of a cosmic reward for having passed through the trial, for having let go of our selves and released our clutch on knowledge I was able to appreciate the beautiful patterns of all that was around me from a very `sober' perspective. I was able to enjoy the eye-candy and just immerse myself in its beauty until I slowly returned to `normal' perception and eventually to baseline at T+12 hours.



To summarize: I thoroughly enjoyed 2C-P, and it brought me to a lot of great realizations. For me it was a much more mental than visual experience with the visuals more present after the mental peak, which was blissful. It is truly an immersive experience and is not to be taken lightly or casually. It is the sort of trip where I really have to devote my day to it. I like the very slow buildup. If I had been thrown into that kind of a peak quickly, I don't think I would have enjoyed it so much. Finally, T told me that he could have dosed a little bit higher and I feel like I was in the sweet spot right where I was, but I could have gone up to 13-14mg. T is however much lighter than me. I really enjoyed this compound and it will hold a special place in my heart because it immersed me in an allegory that showed me how little I really know. It taught me the lesson that I should never believe in any certainty.



I figure it works something like this:

-when you're born you don't know that you don't know, so you don't know

-eventually you start to have preconceptions and you know that you know, so you don't know

-but eventually all of us must learn that you know that you don't know, so you know

(if that makes any sense)



2C-P was one of my most memorable trips. It has a very slow comeup and a deliciously long peak.



My experiences seem to be very nonstandard. A lot of drugs affect me very differently from most people, so take my words with a grain of salt, but either way, this was one of my favourite trips. Here's a summary of the timeline:



0:00 - dose

1:00 - subtle mental effects noticed

1:30 - subtle OEVs

2:00 - peak buildup

3:30 - strong COVs and mental buildup still going 

4:00 - peaking

4:30-5:00 - plateau

8:00-9:00 - mental intenseness diminishes

9:00-10:00 - OEVs persist

10:0-12:00 - return to baseline



Happy tripping  :)
