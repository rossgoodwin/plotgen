I don't regularly take pills, it's not something I really enjoy, and I rarely have any anyway. But a little while ago a friend of mine gave me a line or two of some pill. She's a great friend, lots of experience when it comes to drugs, so I figured it was probably a Percocet or something and snorted it. It was around 5pm.



After a little while I started to feel dizzy and heavy, like most drugs do to me, but it wasn't noticeably affecting my mood. It wasn't `high'\ldots  it felt more like being drunk. I tried to run for a few feet and I just about fell on my face. It was somewhat pleasant, nonetheless. I didn't notice the cold weather hardly as much as I did before I took it. At around 5:30 my buddies took me home and left, when I took about 4 to 6 Benadryls (I really don't remember how many I took. It was around 150mg of Diphenhydramine) 



At around 6:30ish the benadryl was kicking in pretty well. I was really drowsy and I just felt heavy all around. The weird things I was seeing because of the Benadryl wasn't helping too much, either. Everything was twitching and I kept imagining people walking around my house, but it didn't bug me too much cause I'm very familiar with the effects of diphenhydramine. I decided to lie down for a few minutes, and that's all I remember happening. I passed out, I guess. It wasn't any later than 7.



I woke up at around 5 or 6 in the morning, completely clueless to my surroundings of course. It only took me a few minutes to figure out that I had fallen asleep and had been in the same spot for the past 10 hours. I hadn't even taken anything off before I lied down, I was completely dressed sans boots. All the windows on my computer were the same and I didn't even turn my lights off before I fell asleep. It was whatever, I thought. I just fell asleep.



Got ready and went to school as usual when I found out that one of my other friends who had done the same pill, just earlier in the day (she took hers $\sim$9am) had been in the emergency room all yesterday and was still in the hospital for an overdose. I don't know how many she took, it was probably 2 or 3.



As it turns out, the friend that gave me the line didn't even know what it was. She was under the impression it was Valium or Percocet. When I told her that I passed out and had no clue what was goin' on, she flipped and told me I need to take it easy. 



I was talking to an acquaintance of mine the other day about the experience, and I described the pill to him. It was yellow/orangeish and an ellipse. He told me it was probably Xanax. I don't know, though. I've never heard of Xanax hospitalizing anyone.



I definitely didn't expect any of that to happen. All I expected was maybe a buzz, like a mild high. Turns out this shit sent a friend of mine into the hospital (I have no clue what happened to her after that. I asked her boyfriend and he didn't know, either.) and made me conk out for a good 10 hours.



All I suggest to people is, don't take anything unless you are 100\% aware of what it is.
