Fist off, ths substance was purchased over the net, by a friend of mine now refered to as Mr. E. He bought 500 mgs for 90\$, but because of mailing complicaions was given 1,000 mgs. The substnce was given in a short, clear-brown vial. 



Upon the label was stated: 

(alpha,O-Dimethylserotonin DANGER- NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. For Research/Laboratory Use only. Purity 99.5\%)



Mr. E gave me an eyed-out dose of (approx.) 5-10 milligrams (I wouldn't recommend doing so), which he had put into an emptied 100-mg. gelatin vitamin capsule. He had used it previously (my dose), so he gave himself an approx. 10-15 mg. dose

Me=  T-1:00 p.m.----Swallowed 5-MeO-AMT capsule

Mr. E=  T-3:00 p.m.----Swallowed 5-MeO-AMT capsule



I had to go to school at 1:10 p.m., and after researching all the info on it that I could find, I read that it usually begins to come on in 1.5-2 hrs. after consumption, and figured that by the time I got out of school (3:00 p.m.) it would begin kicking in. I was a little off in the timing, for it began while I was sitting in class (2:20 p.m). The oncoming feelings I had were purely physical, for the most part, I wanted to get up and begin running around the room. I had an increase in energy, and that by sitting and doing schoolwork made me feel anxious to leave. Scool let out, were I quickly unlocked my bike and began to speedily peddle it to my friends house, who I will call Mrs. S. She knew what I was doing, When I had taken it, and that if anything bad happened to me that she should call for help. 



I was very talkitive, and wanted to see what Mr.E was up to, so I gave him a cal and had him come over. He came with someone I'll name Mr.B , who will be our driver for the night. He came over at 3:40 p.m. I read that 5-Meo-AMT causes upset stomachs and the runs, but I never  felt like pukeing, but Mr.E did. We both experienced the runs, though. Mr.E took about a half hour of dry heaving, but never threw up.

 

Me=  T-5:15 pm----Began Peaking

My visuals mainly consisted of geometrical shapes being distorted.The brick walls were swimming like water, if I touched the bricks,then it would begin rippleing, as if the bricks were water and my finger was a raindrop. Laying on my back in the grass while staring at the clouds was by far the most beautifull thing I have ever seen. Clouds move with the wind (of course) but to me it seemed that they were moving away from me, as if i was the center of the `thing' they were moving away from. The trees do not yet have leaves on them, and the emptuy branches began forming into a solid mass of wood,  or a ball of wood atop the trunk. We all then smoked 2 joints, which heavily increased the visualizations. I closed my eyes to see if i could receive CEV's, but to no prevail. 



I had to use the b-room, \#2, so  went in and sat down to the worst and odd diarreah I've ever had. Mrs.S's shower stall was covered in tiles, and if i focused on one vertical line of tiles that the rest would `gather' towards that set. Then the individual sets (vertically) would move up and down fluidly. I can't really explain it. After my mainly gassy outbursts, I went back outside to join the group. I felt mentally more aware of each individual's psyche, and examined their reactions to what was being said to them. I felt like I was beginning to understand human reactions due to communication, that it was a massive formula to manipulate, understand, and make more human relatinships. Ironically, as I grew to understand this, the less I talked. I began to tell myself that the more analytical I became to understand something, the more detached I became to what it Truly meant, that there's a line between fully understanding and over understanding, and that it could be applied to any subject. 



I decided that after I told myself this, that  I should try to find my `line'. I did so by conversating and not thinking about it. Rather deep. Mrs.S had to work, so we left at 7pm. Mr.E began peaking then. We went to a wooded area near one of our schools, sitting on a fallen tree, and smoked another joint. Mr.E reported to us that everything in the forest was green and was giving off a green hue to everything, including us - our clothes, faces,etc. He said that he could `feel' the forest. After saying that, I knew what he was talking about, because the tree I was sitting on began to `speak' to me, telling me of how it is to grow. I was given my first ever CEV, by it, and I was shown how the tree came to be and showed me it's life over the years. I saw it growing ultra-fast, like the  still photos of fruit deacaying, and showed me how it fell. It was struck by lightning, and when I was shown that experience of lightning striking it, I felt the electricity run through my body. Tingling, god the tingling. I felt like  my cells were being given a jolt of high energy, all focused in on  the sensation. 



I was interuppted by Mr.B (not on 5-MeO-AMT) who was carrying a large stick-log and accidentally hit me in the head with it. From there on out was the worst f-ing migraine in the world. My `trip' ( I call it soul-journeys) then ended, and I ws immersed into headache world from 8pm-2am. Over all, I would recommend this substance for spiritual use, not for `fun', and definetely not to those who can't handle being detached from reality or aren't somewhat mentally grounded.  It was  enjoyable for me, with hardly any negative physical effects.
