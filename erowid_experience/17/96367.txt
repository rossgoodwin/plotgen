\#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SUBSTANCE\_ID\_QUESTION\#\#



[Erowid Note: This report is marked as a 5-MeO-DALT report, but readers should be aware there are aspects of it that suggest the identification may be incorrect.]  



Drug Background: I've dabbled in just about everything. Including but not limited to; Cannabis, Alcohol, DXM, Ketamine, Cocaine, Amphetamines, Methamphetamines, MDMA, Various forms of Opiates such as Oxycontin, Morphine Sulfate, Hydrocodone, Dilaudid, etc., Psilocybin, Inhalants such a Nitrous Oxide, A few different RC's such as 2C-I, JWH-018, AM-2201 etc., and a daily cigarette smoker for about 5 years now.



Misc. Info: I obtained approximately 1 gram of the `psychedelic' 5-MeO-DALT through a trusted UK based RC vendor for about 40USD. Took about 3 weeks for delivery. Actually thought for a week or so I had just been scammed out of 40 bucks but it got here eventually.



Pre-Dose: I find a little ziploc baggy labeled 5-MeO-DALT with NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION branded under the tag. It contains a fluffy white powder with seemingly the same consistency as flour but with what looks like tiny microscopic crystals mixed in with the powder. I'm a little skeptical at first considering my research on the RC had usually found it to be almost consistent to brown sugar, but I throw caution to the wind for the sake of the research.



Initial Dose: Shulgin reported dosing at 15mg and I thought I'd one up him, so, I measure out 30mg and carefully scoop the powder into some empty plastic pill capsules I always keep handy. I ingest the capsules and wash them down with some soda and take note of the time on my cell phone. About 10:45am.



11:45am - I begin to notice a slight body load coming on but nothing else really pronounced.



12:45pm - Still not really feeling anything so, I go for broke and measure out 200mg and load it in segments into a bowl of Cannabis. (Putting in a little Cannabis and then covering the top with the 5-MeO-DALT powder and then covering THAT with more Cannabis and repeating until the bowl is packed to the top.) I understand that this is an EXTREME overdose compared to most other trip reports I've read but, I'm chasing the high at this point and decide to do it anyway.



1:00pm (About 5 minutes after finishing smoking) - I begin to feel the normal and welcomed effects of the Cannabis take place and decide to kick back and wait to see what happens. I must note that when I smoked the bowl referred to above, the substance quite instantly turned to a yellowish liquid and started to vaporize while leaving the lingering taste of perhaps burning plastic in my mouth. Reminded me some what of how Methamphetamines react when smoked. But I digress.



1:15 - Definitely starting to feel something. I feel high from the Cannabis but something else is present, however, I can't quite put my finger on it. I begin to feel the same body load as before but MUCH more pronounced. 



2:00pm - Considering I only smoked about 0.5 grams of regular strength Cannabis, (Shwag) I realize I am WAY above the point I should be just from the Cannabis alone. This is when the full effects of the substance begin to become apparent. Lights are much brighter than normal, sounds are louder and more vibrant, and I find myself in a dreamy, euphoric state of mind. It's almost as if the substance was only working to intensify the effects of the Cannabis. Even though I had only smoked a minimal amount I feel higher than I ever have in my many years of pot smoking. I'm living inside my own mind at this point. The `inner monologue' that usually comes on with smoking is far greater than normal. I talk to myself for what seemed like hours while watching the trees outside blow in the wind. 



Although I didn't notice very pronounced visual distortions/hallucinations colors did seem brighter and it was generally enjoyable. I step out onto the balcony adjacent to my room and light a cigarette. I notice as I stand up my heart rate is a bit above normal but not by much. Maybe 10-15BpM over normal. I figure the Nicotine will calm my nerves and help with this anyway. Everything feels great. I watch the smoke drearily drift away from me and I follow it with my eyes as far as I can. I notice myself drifting off into odd trains of thought. I'm so in tune with my own sense of self awareness I forget about the cigarette completely. I go back inside and lay down in bed to see what's on TV. The effects stated above last for another few hours, plateauing at about 1-1.5 hours after smoking.



Synopsis: Alone, I would say there's not much recreational value to it if you're just looking to get fucked up or trip balls for a while, although, I haven't experimented with it alone at doses higher than 100mg nor with any other ROA than ingestion. Combined with the Cannabis it was one of the more enjoyable researches I've conducted recently but due to the lengthy (or seemingly lengthy I should say) effects I can't see myself doing it more than once or twice a month.
