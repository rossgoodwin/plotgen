Well I have heard that Zoloft is not for everyone, but it sure is for me. First of all, its a perfect `drug' for me, because I can hide it well, and I have parents that would skin me alive if I was on drugs



So, my story starts last night. I was talking to my friend on AIM, and he was telling me about stuff he found out online about Rx drugs. He got to zoloft and it lit something in my head. I remembered that my sister took it, and there was a full bottle of it down stairs. So I went to get it, and after learning of common side effects, I mustered up my courage and took it, same time as my friend over AIM. We both took 100 mg.



I asked him how long the effects took to hit in, he was already feeling some mild euphoria and a warm pleasent feeling in his chest. He guessed that it would take about 20 minutes more for mine to kick in. So I waited, and got bored. All of a sudden I got a burst of warms throughout my body, starting at my chest. I got exited, becuase this was my first time taking any drug other then `tabacco high'. But within 4 or 5 minutes, the feeling had faded back to normal. All I felt that was a strange but slight, not unpleasent or pleasent, just there, pressure on the sides of my head.



I was getting annoyed, beucase it had been a good 40 minutes sence I took the pill, and nothing substancial had happened. My friend suggested I lay down and listen to some trance music. I did, and was A) not bored like a usually am by techno/trance B) hearing the sounds in my head, not through the headphones and C) feelings the sounds. It was mildly cool, but I only listened to one song.



As I was getting up, my arms were out to my sides. I felt nothing. It felt like my arms had been on my sides all along. I layed back down and did that a few more times, smiling every time I felt the eerie `moving through' my body feeling.



I went back to my computer, and continued talking to my friend. We were both annoyed by the weakness of the drug so far. After another 30 minutes or so of talking, we decided we would just go to bed and this was a waste of time. Side note: we both had trouble falling asleep.



I woke the next morning feeling good. The second my eyes opened, I didn't get the usual feeling of heavy lids, and blinking a lot. It was a burst. My eyes just shot open, and I was wide awake. I showered, went to school feeling mildy woozy at 1st block.



Told teacher I was going to the bathroom. Looked at myself in the mirror, see if I looked funny. I sure was feeling energetic but not hyper, I was feeling good, even with the woozyness. I leaned into the mirror, looked at my pupils. They were enormous. My friends had pointed this out to me earlier, but I blew it off. No adults were noticing, as it could only be noticed if u were looking strait into my eyes.



2nd block. Woozyness becomes plesent `full' feeling. I feel full up to my throught, almost like I'll through up, but its soothing. I suddenly realize I am not zoning out like I usually do during my teachers boring classes, but paying attention, picking up every word, and understanding it. I got the whole lesson before everyone else, and I was answering peoples questions for them.



lunch, no appitite.



3rd block, social studies. We played a stupid game shaped by jepordy. It was boring and stupid, but I was getting everything right. I began just pressing the buzzer when he finished the question, weather I knew the answer already or not. I always got it right.



Last block, algebra. The only subject I have trouble in. She gave us some problems to do, I usually either give up on or get wrong. I did both in about 2 minutes. Faster then usual. Both were correct. I was paying attention perfectly, as I had been all day. It was incredible.



After that, the effects faded, nothin interesting. 



Incredible, I loved it, I felt like I could do whatever I wanted. I should add that I am not depressed in any way, and the zoloft was not subscribed to me.
