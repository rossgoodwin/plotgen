I was in my local supermarket and was walking through the tea section when something caught my eye. One box was labeled `Kava Tea'. Remembering reading about kava kava, I baught the box and returned home. each teabag contained 78mg of kava root extract, so I decided to drink 2 bags worth and see how I was feeling.

 

About an hour after drinking the two cups, I felt very relaxed. I decided I wanted to go further though, so I made 2 more cups. While the tea bags were soaking in the hot water, I took a shot of vodka. I felt the affects immediately, and just had to sit down. Then I chugged each cup of kava tea. Half an hour later I was sitting on my sofa loving everything around me.



I was having affects similar to marijuana. I was so relaxed at this point that I decided it would be a good time to meditate. Before meditating though, I helped myself to one more hot cup of kava tea, which I drank slowly. The meditation was amazing, I had several out of body experiences, and was at total peace with everything around me.

 

When I was done meditating I had a beer, and then chugged another cup of kava tea. Lying in my bed before going to sleep, I slowly sipped my last cup of kava tea as I listened to relaxing music. Then I lay down and fell asleep immediately. In my dream I remmeber thinking to myself: `Am I in a dream? Whoa, I am in a dream.'



I had alot of fun in this dream of mine because I could control my every action, and even the actions of those around me. It was like playing god. I went on adventures, took huge risks knowing that I wouldn't die, and just had lots of fun. It was like I had rented an immortal god's body for one night. Truly an amazing exerience.



The next morning when I awoke, I was the most refreshed and relaxed I have ever been. I just lay on my bed for a while, in a peaceful state of mind. I highly recomend kava tea, it was very enjoyable and relaxing.  I will definately do kava again, but I'm going to wait at least a month so I can appreciate it as much as I did last night.
