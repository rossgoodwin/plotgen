Having not tripped for a few months, I decided to grab three tabs of acid and have some fun.  I took them at 6 pm on a Tuesday night.  This seemed silly, especially since I had to go to work the next morning, but there was no time in the next few weeks in which I'd be able to use the acid, so I decided to go for it.  I was alone in my room - I didn't want to freak out my roommates, they have no idea that I've ever touched drugs, and I couldn't find anyone to trip with.  However, I had had experience with psychedelic drugs, including acid, so I was sure I would be able to handle it.



The effects started in about 20-30 minutes.  The effects were strongly physical - a tingling, tense, nervous sensation.  As the body load increased I began to recognize it as extremely pleasurable.  I sat listening to music, psychedelic trance and drum \& bass, and I just felt incredibly alive.  The effects increased and I started sweating, twitching, and feeling unsteady.  I looked very strange in the mirror.  It occurred to me that intense body sensations may be a prerequisite to a fundamental mental or spiritual experience.  I understood why people often require strenuous physical work, like climbing a mountain, to have spiritual experiences - the bizarre physical sensations put you out of your element and lower your boundaries to prepare you for a deep mental experience.  I am an atheist, but I kept thinking `If I was only religious, I would be so enraptured by god right now!'  For a moment I thought I believed in god, but I am such a died-in-the-wool nonbeliever that it didn't quite happen.



The music was unbelievably spellbinding, in a very different way from cannabis.  it was loud and had a 3D sensation, bouncing all around my skull.  But more than that, the sounds seemed to `mix' with my other senses in the sense that they were at times unrecognizable as sound, but appeared as thoughts, emotions, or just some general cognitive input that I perceived as `more than just sound.'  The music acquired an insanely dramatic and emotional quality to the point where I was quivering and utterly gripped.  The time dilation was very noticeable - I'd listen for what seemed like forever and realize that the song hadn't changed.



I lay down on my bed for a rest.  At that point, my phone rang.  The call-display said it was my dad.  I didn't answer and he left me a voicemail message, which I listened to.  At that point I started to get very emotional.  I love my dad but in my life I have let him down.  My dad is a far better person than me - he loves me and wants me to succeed but I know I am a disappointment to him.  I have become extremely isolated and distant from him even though I do love him in my heart.  The thought of me not being able to talk to him because I was strung up on drugs made this fact really hit home.  At this point I imagined how my dad feels - totally out of control, not understanding what happened to his son, not understanding why his years of efforts have slowly gone awry.  I cried uncontrollably, which I haven't done in years.  Tears seemed to explode out of my eyes for several minutes. I imagined how my Dad must feel to `lose control' and see his son growing so for apart from him, and my brain actually lost control, spiraling in random directions and confusion as I imagined his confusion.  I kept apologizing: `I try my best Dad!  I really do!'  but the tears kept coming.



Eventually I stopped and decided to enjoy some music again.  I started to get another curious mental effect I have gotten with other hallucinogens, in which my brain produces thoughts composed of sounds, images, memories, and colors all mixed together in an incoherent way.  For instance: the sound `Lendel' or `Mendel,' the color orangish/brown, the image of a fat, elderly European woman spinning, and a vague emotion of embarassment and a trace of a memory melded together to form a thought.  This thought was very ephemeral - I could not form a mental image of this fat lady, the thought would just fire for a second and disappear and I couldn't actually introspect about it to form a more fully detailed picture.  A few thoughts like this fired in a loop, over and over.  It occurred to me that when I think of, say, an elephant, the brain is linking together numerous concepts - the word, the color, the image, the memories associated with it, and so forth.  All these thoughts are triggered simultaneously when I think of `elephant.'  Well, on acid, my brain was forming thoughts based on inputs from all of these concepts, but the concepts appeared to have been chosen randomly so the actual thought I generated did not correspond to anything real.



The synthasesia and `mental garbage' effects, the most striking aspects of the LSD experience, disappeared after an hour or two.  But I was left with the ability to think weird thoughts.  These thoughts were not so much `new' as creative extensions of beliefs I already had.  I was able to think about them with peculiar lucidity.  Example: in my line of work lots of people are super egotistical, clawing their way up to a more prestigious position.  I have long been somewhat embarassed about this prestige-whorishness and self-contragulation but unable to prevent it in myself.  On acid, the word `prestige' actually became a disgusting, vile word.  It didn't make me think of negative attributes, it had negative attributes, in the same way that the thought `red' is linked to a mental image of the color `red.'



Meanwhile, the following wonderful thought occurred to me: perhaps true virtue, something you are truly skilled at and for which you deserve respect, is by definition something you cannot recognize.  The moment I start introspecting about how good I am, I cease to be good; only the unconscious exercise of competence or quality constitutes legitimate merit.  Therefore, the less egotistical I am, the better I am.  This seemed to make perfect sense and be an excellent way of going through life and it pleased me quite a bit.  However, it was not really a fundamentally new insight - it was a logical extension of my own internal discomfort of the egotism and prestige-whorishness; just bringing the thought to a more sweeping, aesthietic, and creative conclusion.



After the initial 2-hour or so peak, the effects slowly but surely declined.  After about eight hours I was able to walk around outside - things were still weird, but I was outwardly coherent.  The dropoff was very slow and there was no way I could sleep that night.  At 8:00 AM, 14 hours after I took the acid, I was still strung out and had a headache without being able to sleep.  (Note: all psychedelics seem to last inordinately long for me.  Salvia often persists for half an hour to an hour, a 60 mg AMT trip lasted 23 hours, etc.)  I went to work and a hellish, headache-filled, exhausting day.  I got almost nothing done.  I got home at 5:30 PM and slept for about five hours.  I felt quite renewed afterwards and called my elderly grandmother for the first time in a long, long time; she was delighted to hear from me and we had a great conversation.



Overall, this was a very positive experience.  Next time, I would like to take it outside and with a group of friends.  I would also like to take it with some cannabis to enhance the bizarre synesthesia/mental garbage/mental randomness effects which I find so weird and fascinating.
