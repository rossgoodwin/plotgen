[Erowid Note: The author of this report erroneously refers to Benadryl as dimenhydrinate.]





T:00 





I ingest 18 Benadryl 25mg Dimenhydrinate + 30mg sublingual of codeine for a little mellowness.  Totally empty stomach





T:05 





Put on Nirvana-Nevermind, which usually puts me in a good mood. I heard dmhyd makes music sound different in a weird sort of way.  





T:10 





Feel a bit sleepy, It's already around my bedtime anyway.  I decided to do it around when I was tired, since I didn't want to take it during the day, only to fall asleep during the middle of the day and screw up my sleeping schedule.





T:15 





Feeling a little more sleepy.  I already feel the subtle effects of codeine, sort of warm feelings.  I can almost feel the benadryl digesting now, it will probably be coming on soon.





T:20 





I grab a pepsi and start drinking it.  The music I'm listening to seems a little more hollow. I feel a slight euphoria, a little light-headed and sort of warm.  Probably just the codeine again.





T:25 





Feeling fuzzy headed.  Sort of dizzy now and heavy. More tired.





T:30  





Feel very blank headed, my thought process is very slow now.  Very off-kilter.  The sleepiness is getting worse.  Time seems to be going slower.





T:35 





Time is going by VERY SLOWLY now.  1 minute feels like 20 minutes now.  Feeling a new sort of euphoria rising, a very small body high, and it doesn't feel like the codeine this time. The pepsi is becoming tasteless and my tongue is moving very slowly.





T:40 





Nothing new.  Just even more sleepy.  





T:45 





I have been sitting down the whole time, so I decided to walk around and see how it is.  Very heavy legs and arms.  Getting harder to type and think.  Stomach feeling sort of queasy.  A little more euphoria, I can definitely tell its not the Codeine.





T:50  





Taste buds are almost totally gone.  Really tired and out of it, don't know if I can continue documenting  OMG saw my first hallucinotgetic.  A flash of green on the wall for about a second.  It's getting hard to swallow.





T:55  





So sleeepyy.  Very mindless.  Might fall asleep.  





T:60 





Feeling very fucking woozy, very tired.  A little hard to breathe now, but nothing serious.  





T:65  





Almost nodded off.  No hallucinations yet except for that green flash awhile back.





T:70 





Still NOTHING!  I thought this would be enough time for it to kick into effect of a deleriant.





T:80 





Ingested a 12 pack of 25mg, bringing my total too 750mg now.  I thought maybe the dose I took wasn't enough for the deleriant experiance.





T:85 





Sleepiness has seemed to pass.  Getting more of a buzz at least.  Almost like Codeine, but a lot weaker. Thank god.  I have to wait another half an hour to see if I get some hallucinations. 





T:90 





Nothing has changed.  I'm really surprised that I didn't fall asleep.  I usually fall asleep with a half of a Benadryl.





T:95 





I'm surprised, but I'm getting a little more euphoria.  It feels like I took about 60-80 mg of codeine.  A warmness in my body is evident when I move around.  Feels good, but a little less pronounced than opiates.


 


T:100 





Even more opiate like euphoria.  Man I should definitely mix this with a lot of codeine next time.  As I'm writing this, I am now feeling rushes of warmth.  It couldn't of been brought up by the codeine i had earlier because I never got this kind of a buzz off 30 mg of codeine.  





T:105 





Still no hallucinations.  I'm defintely really fucking out of it right now.  I'm hoping to see a nude woman pop out of nowhere lol.  I was laughing at that for 3 minutes straight.  Feeling a little crazy.  





T:110  





Very dissapointed now.  It's not working.  And wow, I swear this euphoria is pretty good.  Uh oh, as I'm typing this i'm goin insanae.  My mind is turning into a fuzz and mixing stuff up.  





T:115  





Not talking like myself any more.  There seems to be milli-second of time between when I say something, and when gets out.  Its really funny to talk.  Very hollow sounding. 





T:120  





I am WAYYY fucked up right now.  Saying weird things and doing them.  Almost no control over what I say or do.   





T:125  





I said lemon round pie is a pie (talking to my self) and some other phrase.  For no reason.  Oh my god, I can barely write any more, I'm in a daze of stupor.  





T:130 





My mind is gone right now.  Not thinking at all.  





T:135 





Every television show is sort of warping into another.  I'm losing it. I popped a 10 mg dose of valium, because I'm very ansty and don't want a bad trip





Lost track of time.  I am messed completely.  Its like getting piss drunk.  I'll continue with my experiences:





If I lay back, I will instantly drift out and sleep.  And I just thought that this notepad document I wrote it on was a goddam webpage, how strange.





Now I'm fading in and out over and over again.  My body still has a glow.  





I think I heard an audio illusion from somewhere, hmm probably not.  





My stomach is queasy, and time is passing by REALLY SLOW!  I think slower than marijuana.  I can barely cmmunicate here.  I am so out of it.  I'm wat





DMX - which company makes the d   





(note I edited everything but this last sentence before posting it, just to show how messed up I was at the end.  I spelled a lot of words incorrectly and my grammar was off, but at the end nothing made sense.)





After I woke up I still had the hollow voice sound and the general Benadryl hangover.  Its a very depressing one at that.
