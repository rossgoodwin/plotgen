Dose: 1 blotter tab + 3 joints

Duration: $\sim$24 hours, about 8 hours of peak tripping



I recently aquired several tabs containing bromo-drangonfly from a friend who synthesizes his own tryptamines and phenethylamines - he wanted people to sample his chemicals to get feedback for later projects.  I consider myself somewhat of an experienced psychadelic user, though these days my trips are few and far between.  I've done mushrooms 30-40 times, an array of tryptamines (foxy, amt, dipt, etc\ldots ), phenethylamines (2ci, 2ce), dxm, ketamine, and ecstacy probably 10 times.



Kim and I woke up at 9am on Saturday to prepare for a nature excursion, and I had decided to sample the dragonfly. This was my first psychadelic trip since taking mushrooms 3 months ago in an arboretum with several friends. I dosed at 11am, about an hour before we left. Although it takes almost 4-5 hours to reach peak tripping, within an hour after taking it I began to feel that familiar body buzz/energy that both phenethylamines and tryptamines give me - it was slightly nauseating but not overwhelming - I mostly got restless and had to pace around. Once Kim and I got on the road I sparked a joint, and immediately the stomach tension went away. The pot didn't boost the feeling in any way, in fact over the course of the day I smoked 2-3 times, and unlike most tryptamines, the pot seemed to blanket the overall feeling rather than boosting it. I've noticed this effect with other phenethylamines (2ci, 2ce, etc\ldots ), perhaps pot doesn't share the same synergy? It's a shame.



30 minutes later we arrived at the forest preserve, and the dragonfly kept seeping in - still no visuals or blatant body highs, but definitely an energy going on somewhere. We parked and took off down a path into the woods, and after 15 minutes we arrived at a secluded meadow that was littered with the remains of what used to be several buildings, as well as an old, rusted flagpost and elecricity equipment. The whole setting was eerie but really serene - it looked like a nostalgic painting or a scene out of Texas Chainsaw Massacre at the same time. By the time we sat down under a tree on the edge of the meadow I was over 2h30 into it, and the most noticeable feeling was the body buzz. I kept to tightening and loosening my muscles involuntarily, and my body felt strangely light - like a floating feeling. The more still I got the more I noticed the subtle psychedelic effects, first auditory hallucinations - gusts of wind would blow through trees, knocking down acorns, and the overall sound was very distorted and almost sounded digital. Even more striking were the planes flying overhead.



Visually, I noticed some increased color saturation and very distinct, literal trails behind everything, particularly when flies would go by or leaves would fall. Overall, the visuals weren't nearly as pronounced as I was expecting, nothing close to mushrooms or even foxy or amt. There were several moments where they manifested themselves more strongly, i.e. I started seeing waves/rays coming off the tree as if the sky and air around it was water, or at one point as I stared at the tree it suddenly turned into what looked like a hologram, and started rippling towards and away from me. Besides these noticeable effects, the visuals were subtle. In lower-light settings, i.e. clubs or raves, I'd imagine they'd be more pronounced.



Kim and I alternated between sitting on the blanket and walking around, taking pictures of the forest and playing frisbee. Most of the time I found myself not knowing what to do with myself, being indecisive - definitely a side-effect of the pot no doubt, which I smoked a couple times in an effort to boost the trip, though to no avail. We stayed at the park until sunset, and began to head home as dusk was creeping in\ldots  we ended up taking a different route back to the car, and at one point completely lost track of where we were, which started to get both Kim and I really nervous given that we had no map and there were no signs anywhere. Strangely, though I was nervous, it didn't wreck the trip or send me into the pits of hell as some situations have before - the degree of introspection, ego-loss, and disassociation was minimal compared to other substances.



We got back to Kim's place in the evening, loaded up on a movie (Ong Back: Thai Warrior) and some curry, and spent the night in. Watching a movie was incredibly fun and enjoyable, and kind of mirrored the feeling the trip was giving me - it felt more like a light indulgence than a serious, transcendant affair. Didn't feel like it had the depth of things like psilocybin, k, etc\ldots  After Kim crashed around 12 I stayed up until about 6 am, I was simply unable to sleep - the body buzz persisted, even as my mind began to shut down. It wasn't speedy per se, just energy in general, somewhat like ectasy. I was pretty dazed and out of it the next day, in fact I had to take a 3 hours nap.



In conclusion, I would have liked to have taken a higher dose, but was weary of eating two tabs. Two tabs would have definitely been on the strong end of the tripping spectrum, and would have likely yielded a ++++ experience, but considering I'm somewhat of a hardhead, particularly with tryptamines and phenethylamines, other people are likely to trip hard off of one tab. The most noticeable effect of the drug was the body energy, which is somewhat analogous to ectasy though not quite as soft and cuddly - it is still quite sexual though. I was somewhat disappointed I didn't have more visuals than I did, as that's always a favorite part of my trip, but it was still enjoyable.



I'll refrain from making any conclusions or statements about the drug, however, as I would like to make my mind up after taking a higher dose. Unfortunately I only have one tab left so I won't ever achieve that, but it was nonetheless enjoyable. Definitely a `mild' feeling.
