Before summer of 2003, I started to experiment with drugs. I had been smoking cigarettes since I was 8, and at this time I was 13. I started with weed and then I progressed to harder drugs.



I had just heard about DXM in september 03. I wanted to find other easy to obtain OTC psychoactives, and my friend had told me about benadryl and that it had a hallucinogen called diphenhydramine. He told me about the effects. I asked him if it was euphoric and he said `very'. I was very into euphoric drugs so I decided to try it. It was a friday and my parents were at a local motorcycle gathering that took place every friday night. I walked to the nearest gas station and bought a box of benadryl. when I got home, I popped them out of the casings and I downed them all. All 24.



It was about two hours later and I noticed that movement made a feeling that resonated through my whole body. I started whaling my arms about and it created a shock-like tingle through my arms. I was also very alert. a slight abnormal, sudden noise and I nearly shit my pants. I had to go to the bathroom and when I was on the toilet, I noticed my legs were a little shaky. I stared at myself in the mirror. my mouth agape, my eyes dilated, my face flushed and pale. The walls obtained a weird look. They didnt look different, they just felt strange. Vein-like lines appeared on the walls and started twitching. I was a little freaked out. 



The phone rang. the caller ID showed it was My mom. Oh crap, oh crap, should I answer the phone?? I answered the phone with a shaky voice. apparently she didn't notice. she asked me if I wanted something to eat and i said `yes'. About an hour later I heard the bikes roll in. `Fuck FUCK!! I'm going to get caught! I'll pretend I'm asleep. They walked in and I was lieing on the couch. `Anthony? oh well someone gets an extra hamburger'. I felt my heart pounding fast and I thought `my heart's pounding so fast they'll see my shirt shaking and they'll know somethings wrong'.



When they ate, I went to my room. I felt so exhausted and scared, not only am I at extreme risk of getting caught, this trip is starting to turn into a wreck. I was watching my sisters dark room across the hall and I saw a transparent figure, almost resembling a dog. It was playing with bed sheets, just like a dog would. I then lied down on my bed trying to go to sleep. I suddenly had `thoughts' about my family being hung in the living room with theyre faces all beat up, ripped up, torn off, bloody and distorted. I didn't TRY to think of that, I just had weird sudden thoughts about it. I also saw an arm lieing near my face. It didn't scare me, I just looked at it. And it wasn't my arm.



I couldnt go to sleep. I felt so scared and alone. I felt as if people, even my own family, were waiting in the walls about to kill me if I peered my head to the other side of the bed. I finally fell asleep and I woke up about 1:00 a.m. I went down stairs and saw my dad in his chair. He vanished. I realised a little later that I just had a hallucination. I lied down on the couch again, now looking toward the kitchen. I couldn't see it but for some reason I thought my dad was trying to hide from me on the other side of the kitchen wall.



I felt like hell so I turned on the t.v. It made me feel a little better but I still felt like I was in a haunted house and a haunted body. I saw my fan twitch and that freaked me out. I saw my mantle above the fire place wave and that was a little odd. I saw those vein-like things on the wall again and they twitched. I thought to myself `why cant this just be over. Its got to wear off sometime'. The thought that its just any other drug and that it had to wear off sometime comforted me a little. I woke up about 9:00 in the morning. It was over. I looked in the mirror and my eyes were still dilated. I tried to hide my eyes from my parents durring the whole day. I still felt a little fatigued but the overall intoxication had worn off.



I thought to my self, `euphoria my ass. I aint doing this crap again'. I later found out it has been categorized as a deleriogen. If you have connections to, or are offered deleriogens such as diphenhydramine or dimenhydrinate, I urge you, for your own safety against suicide and insanity, DON'T DO IT.
