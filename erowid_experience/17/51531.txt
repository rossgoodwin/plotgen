The evening started with 15mg of 2C-E added to a fair quantity of water.  Had just started reading PiHKAL and remembered Shulgin's mention of `if you're looking for a good time, you'll get a good time. If you're looking for something profound, you'll get something profound'



Well I decided I was looking for something profound that evening.  Perhaps my mistake.



t+0:15 - I was invited by a friend to take a few hits of cannabis with him and his girlfriend. I remember reading reports of enhanced effects with cannabis, so I thought I'd try it out.  After all, I was looking for something profound. I have not eaten for about 6 hours.



t+0:25 - I am forced to pass the pipe after several hits, because I begin to fear this was a mistake.  Light headedness starting to set in slowly, and I continually glance at my hands to check the progress of the 2C-E. (I've found I can identify various stages through the morphing of the skin on my palm)



t+0:35 - I lay on my friends bed as trails start appearing. I glance at my hand and am unable to focus very clearly on it.  I watch as my friend and his girlfriend touch eachother, in what at least appears to me as quite intimately.  They're whispering, and it sounds like she's asking about me, and comments on how I am shaking.  My friend tries to explain what it's like to hallucinate, by comparing movement to dancing in a strobe light.



t+0:40 - I fear that things are setting on far faster and far more intense than I can handle. I pull out my sunglasses to help mellow the visualizations and trails. It also dims the room. (I've found that most of the time, sunglasses help to calm myself if things seem too fast) I notice my two friends move about in the familiar fast-forward motion that I am accustomed to with 2C-E. They decide to put in the movie `Freaks and Geeks'.



t+0:45 - The sun glasses aren't helping much.  They seem to be fogging up, although I know they're not.  I remove them and everything becomes clear again.



t+0:47 - The movie is very interesting. I'm sure I've seen it before, but everything keeps changing.  I find myself IN the movie; as if the actors are right next to me and talking to me.  The movie continually changes plots and goes from a high school setting, to a hospital, then to a porn set. It reminds me of another movie\ldots 



t+0:50 - The movie is scaring me. I don't know what's going on with it, and find it extremely hard to concentrate on it. I continually close my eyes tightly and find myself out of the movie, back on the bed. If I watch, I'm drawn into it again.



t+0:52 - I decide I can't watch the movie, so I look around the room.  The curtains suddenly expand and surround the entire room, covering the walls in horizontal lines. Everything else seems blurred, as If i'm look through some sort of distorted glass or crystal.



t+0:55 - The room feels small. The shifting curtains which have surrounded the room feel as if they're moving in.  I tell my friends I need to go outside, and they thank me for joining them and I exit the room.  I take the elevator down to the ground and step outside.



t+0:56 - The cold air seems to help bring me back to reality, but only for a short while. I don't remember if I packed a bowl of tobacco or not. I think so.



--Time starts getting confusing, hence the $\sim$, signifying my guess. --



$\sim$t+1:00 - I don't smoke for long. Its strange outside. I try the sunglasses again, making me appear fully out of place, but they still seem foggy. Now things start getting freaky.  I see two girls walking a dog, they pass me, but only get about 30 feet before they stop.  They stop in mid stride, the dog absolutely still.  I look away, and look back - they're still there, frozen. I look away again, and see a car ahead. It too appears frozen. It could have been the traffic light, but I swear the car is completely still.  I hear the sounds of the city around me, but nothing is moving. I decide to take a walk.



$\sim$t+1:05 - The walk helps. I start moving, and so does everything else. I quickly pass the girls and dog. I do not remember how far I went, but at some point I just turned around and started walking back the same way I came.



$\sim$t+1:07 - I have to pass this long metal-picket fence about a block before I get back, but it's like every step I take, sets me back two steps. It's as if I'm moving backwards while walking forwards\ldots   Looking at the fence does not help, so I concentrate my vision, which is bright and clear at this point, on building far behind it.  I can now walk forward.



$\sim$t+1:10 - I lean up against a giant planter just outside the doors, as I regularly do.  I look through the double doors, and notice someone talking to the security guy at the front. I look away for a moment, and look back in: He's gone. Again I move my attention to something else, and once again look in - now he's there again. This continues several times, with me occasionally squinting hard so that I may `bring myself back to reality'. Each time I do, the person appears. If I drift away, he's gone again. Throughout this, I am looking at my watch occasionally, which I quickly find does not help at all.  I look at it once, and it says 11:48, I look again, and it says 12:32, again and it says 10:28.  At this point, I'm worried. I think that maybe I'm really not outside right now, and that I'm still upstairs in my friends bed. I close my eyes tight and imagine myself lying back in bed; I almost collapse, but it's as if I was really coming back to true reality, upstairs in my friend's bed.



$\sim$t+1:20 - I'm getting worried. Between the watch, and the disappearing person, and frozen objects, I fumble for my phone and try to call my friend back up in his room, in hopes that he'll come out and talk with me for a while.  I find his number and call it. It rings and rings\ldots  I get his voicemail. It's like a horror movie now. I'm getting more anxious and scared. I try the number several times. No answer.



$\sim$t+1:25 - It seems like i've been outside forever. I keep telling myself that I haven't, but that I'm really outside. For some reason I ignore myself, and my mind keeps telling me that I'm still upstairs, in bed.  I call another friend.  No answer.  I try the number again, and finally get in contact with someone. It feels as if I haven't talked to anyone in years\ldots  I'm happy to hear his voice, and ask when he'll be back.  He tells me shortly, so I reply by asking him to meet me in my room. He agrees, so I head inside.



$\sim$t+1:30 - I flash my ID to the security officer and quickly head into the elevator. The quick temperature change helps me come back, but only for a short moment again.  I hit the button for my floor, and listen to the familiar beeps as the elevator passes each floor.  But wait; there's too many beeps, and several will beep too close together, and then a long pause.  I look at the numbers, but i'm not going anywhere.  The floor indicator jumps from 1 to 2 to 3, but then back to 2, and then up to 5, and back down to 4.  I fear as if I'm not moving, and want to get off the elevator.



$\sim$t+1:31 - I reach my floor, and make it back to my room.  I don't want to wake my roommate, so I sit down next to my door and wait for my friend to arrive. My mind is still telling me I'm in my other friends room, so I close my eyes and try to `wake up'.  



$\sim$t+1:40 - I open my eyes to see my friend. standing over me.  He says I was curled up in the fetal position, outside my neighbors door.  I'm still convinced it was mine\ldots  We head down to his floor, and I hold the elevator for him. He comes back and enters the elevator. I stop and look at him. My mind is convinced I'm dreaming.  Everything seems so quiet and unreal.  I tell my friend to punch me, and he questions me. He questions my request several times, and I finally tell him to just do it.  He does, and it makes me feel so much better. `I wouldn't feel that in a dream' I tell myself. 



$\sim$t+1:41 - The ride down isn't so bad. I get outside, but the fresh air doesn't help me any this time.  My friend lights up a cigarette, and everything still seems like it's in fast-forward.  I watch the tobacco quickly burn, but he's not saying much. I think I tried to explain what I was feeling, but I couldn't get the words out.  He just keeps asking `How much did I take?'  I get that feeling that I'm dreaming again.  I tell him that I'm going to bed, and he suggests it's a good idea.  



$\sim$t+1:50 - I make it up to my room and into my bed, fully clothed. I decide to call it quits, and remember telling myself I wanted something profound. I realize that I've got it, and hope that this isn't a dream. It seems to take forever to get to sleep, but I finally do.



I've never experienced time and space distortion as badly as I did in this experience. The frozen people are cars, as well as time jumping around on my watch really started to scare me.



Overall, I would say I would definately mix the two again, but with someone to accompany me the entire time.



My previous experiences with 2C-E have never been so strong, but I think that may also be because before I was looking for a good time, and this time I was looking for the full experience. I'll probably use a lower dosage if ever mixing the two again.
