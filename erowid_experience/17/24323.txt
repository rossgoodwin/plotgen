I recently decided to trip in honor of the beginning summer and a spell of extraordinarily good mood. I pondered the range of substances available, and was intrigued by the idea of trying a new combination. I decided it should be a tryptamine/phenethylamine combo, and at first considered trying 5-MeO-DiPT and 2C-I, 2C-I being one of my favourite substances so far. 5-MeO-DiPT, however, seems to be a tricky substance that has the habit of being quite dissapointing one time and giving you a big surprise the next; also I was a bit worried about the fact that the only experience report on Erowid about this combination was a negative one. So I decided to raid my ever dwindling supply of trusty old LSD instead.



A word about the dosages is perhaps in order. I took 2 hits of moderately strong `European' blotter acid, which many people say to be much stronger than `American' acid; a typical estimate (based on what, I don't know) is 2-3 times as strong. I am something of a hardhead, and 2 hits from this batch has been my usual dose, while my friends usually take only one to trip pretty nicely. I chose to take the usual dose, as LSD has the reputation of a very safe drug physically. The 2C-I dose was 22mg (+-2mg), which is a moderate dose for me; usually I have taken a bit more.



The general timeframe of the trip was roughly as follows:

+0:00		intake of LSD

+0:30		intake of 2C-I

+1:00		coming up

+1:30-+3:30	most intense peak

+3:30-+5:00	still going strong

+5:00-		gradual comedown

+17:00		able to sleep (with help of small benzodiazepine dose)



For impatient readers, a short description of the experience:

The combination of LSD and 2C-I proved to be excellent. The peak of the trip was awesome, extremely positive and quite intense. The 2C-I seemed to complement the LSD in a subtle, yet remarkable way. The visual quality of the trip was amazing. The later stages of the trip and the comedown were a bit more shaky in terms of positive/negative mood, but still very enjoyable most of the time.



A more detailed description of the trip follows.



--



The day of the trip arrived and was bright, warm and sunny. I chose an inside setting anyway, namely my apartment, for I didn't really know what to expect and my usual policy with regards psychedelic substances is `better safe than sorry'. The sun got me in a great mood though, and after a productive day I dropped the acid first at 17:00 (+0:00).The first alerts of the acid were felt 15 minutes after that, heralding quite an intensive trip. I dropped the 2C-I in a gelcap half an hour later (+0:30).



At 18:00 (+1:00), I was already tripping quite nicely and at 18:30 (+1:30) I already was marvelling at how good the combination was. After this, the really intense part started, lasting about two hours. As is the nature of the psychedelic experience, I find the peak impossible to describe in words, so I will not even try to go into much detail, but will instead try to describe some general qualities of the experience. 



The experience resembled a pure LSD trip much more than a pure 2C-I trip, probably because the 2C-I dose was relatively low. The trip was not really that intense in a way, but the sense of wonder and the absolute beauty of everything was incredible. I have had much more intense trips with LSD and psilocube mushrooms, but the 2C-I gave the experience a `shimmer' the like of which I have only glimpsed at before. The experience was quite immersive, for example changing the music did not even occur to me until quite late in the peak, as it was so integrated into my very being. Some adjectives that could be used to describe the trip might be, for example, `sunny', `glowing', `mystical', and `rejuvenating'.



Worth noting is the extremely positive mood that prevailed for the whole peak. Usually my trips, especially with LSD, are marked by fluctuation of mood from positive to negative, sometimes resulting in quite dark and introspective probings of the psyche (not something I would categorize as a `bad trip' in any way, though). This time, however, the experience remained almost completely on the light side. This did not stop me from having several meaningful insights about the nature of the world and my place in it. The 2C-I seemed not only to add to the LSD experience, but subtly restructure it in some way, making it perhaps more controllable in a sense. It should be noted, however, that some of the positive quality of the trip might very well simply be due to the good mood I had experienced in the previous days.



The visual quality of the trip was amazing. I seldom have noteworthy visuals on psychedelics, but the 2C-I gave the `usual LSD visuals' a nice twist, making everything look almost unbelievably beautiful. My apartment bathing in the sun was radiant and colours were perhaps deeper and more intense than I have ever seen. The `phenethylamine visuals' of 2C-I were also present (mainly tracers and afterimages for me).



The most intense and amazing part of the trip only lasted for about two hours, which in retrospect seems a little short, and most likely reflects the duration of the peak of the 2C-I. The two hours seemed to last for an incredibly long time though; the effect of this combination on subjective time was much greater than that of either of the two substances alone. At about 20:30 (+3:30) I noticed that the intensity of the experience was beginning to drop, however the LSD part of the trip was still going strong and the visuals, for example, were still awesome. The 2C-I part of the experience gradually faded away, leaving the LSD part, which also started to gradually fade away at about +5:00, which was approximately when I started to be able to easily use reason and logic again.



A noteworthy event happened at +4:00, when my computer crashed, which was very confusing and among other things brought an end to the music that was playing. Immediately after I rebooted and was recovering mental control of the situation, another situation arose which required me to communicate with several persons on IRC and make complicated assessments about several things. This confused me to no end, and for about an hour I was quite frustrated and gloomy. Luckily, at that point the trip was starting to wind down and soon I was able to grasp the situation more clearly and the rest of the experience was again very enjoyable. However, this serves to illustrate that the later stages of the experience were somewhat fickle (as is usually the case with my LSD trips).



From about +5:00 onwards, the trip was the usual psychedelic comedown for me. The clarity and fluidity of the peak were rapidly fading, but the prolonged endstages of psychedelic experiences are rarely `rough' or irritable for me, and this time proved to be no different. From midnight (+7:00) onwards I repeatedly smoked cannabis and mellowed out. I was pretty tired, but I found I was unable to sleep until at about 10 AM the next day (+17:00), after taking 15mg of oxazepam. I often have some trouble sleeping after taking psychedelics, and have found that in my case combining tryptamines and phenethylamines results in even more prolonged wakefulness. Once, after taking LSD, MBDB and a small amount of 2C-B, I was unable to sleep for about 30 hours, and even then was only able to fall asleep with the help of medication! The next two days I felt quite worn out physically, and slept for large amounts of time.



All in all, the trip was extremely enjoyable. I usually hesitate to recommend any drugs, especially research chemicals, but I can't help commenting that this was a VERY good psychedelic combination and in my opinion well worth trying for those who know what they are doing, have experience with both substances and have found them enjoyable (it seems that relatively many people do not enjoy 2C-I  as much as I do). I have a feeling that using high dosages might be counter-productive, so I recommend at least starting low. Personally, I will definitely try this combination again. The next time I will most likely take the 2C-I somewhat later, to adjust the timing of the peaks a bit. Happy tripping and be careful :)
