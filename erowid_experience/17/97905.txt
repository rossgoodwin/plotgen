(*Sorry for not noting times, I wasn't intending on writing a report)



This report may seem very dull, as it is my first time posting here after reading a ton of reports on numerous substances. I have no real drug usage except for abusing codeine syrup, methylone, and marijuana. Anyways, I've experimented with JWH-018 before. I remember seeing the K2 incense, Scooby Snax, etc. I've smoked a bit of it before, it was okay, except for smoking before I went to a club, 3 different blends mixed, with 3 different chemicals possibly, I couldn't walk, talk, see, focus, think, etc, it was just the worst night of my life. Until this day. 



Back to the story, I know JWH-018, AM-2201, and other analogs were banned after reported `deaths' caused by it. Anyways, I wanted to make some money and read into how easy it was to make your own blends, not getting into any of that, but I acquired some JWH-018 powder. (It was banned at the time, but I still have my ways.) I purchased 170mg which was all I could afford, it was expensive for that small amount. 



I've tried the powder before, neutral experience, it was alright, and one night I wanted to experiment again. I get my wallet and pull out the small bag of powder. I'm pretty good at eyeballing dosages, however, this was a different story. I know 5 mg is the recommended `safe' dosage, so I get some on my finger (the powder is kind of clumpy and easily sticks to my fingertips). I lick the powder off of my finger, wash it down with some cherry 7-up, and wait. 



 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:NOT\_WEIGHED\#\#  



2+ hours passes, nothing happens, so I was thinking it wasn't enough. This is where I made the biggest mistake of my life. I wasn't high, so I figured I needed a higher dosage, I put my hand in the bag, get some on my fingertips, not caring about eyeballing or specific dosage amounts, and lick my fingers, again, washing it down with some 7-up. I didn't think about it until after and I realized, that amount had to be at least 30mg. I just didn't care for some reason, I haven't smoked marijuana in a long time, and just wanted the feeling.



I lay down on my bed and watch some South Park, at some point I listened to a few songs on my laptop and switched back to watching TV. I start feeling good, finally! About 20 minutes passes, and I start getting leg twitches, which I always get while smoking marijuana for some reason, I've asked my friends and it appears it only happens with me for some reason. This was usual for me, I continue watching TV, until I realize I can't think, I slowly begin shaking and twitching more and more over the next few minutes. I realize I've consumed way more than I should have and start freaking out. 



It's like a bad trip. I stand up, I'm able to walk suprisingly, I can't think. I could feel my eyes were so low, I knew the experience was going to be bad, so I start doing push-ups which is a technique I usually use to try and `kill the high', it didn't work this time, it just got worse and worse. At this point, I'm twitching uncontrollably, imagine having a seizure, that's how bad I was twitching. I try to lay down, maybe sleep can help, I twitch more and more when laying down, can't be still. I sit down, nope, same thing except not as bad but still extreme. I look in the mirror and I see how low my eyes are, I have my mouth open, twitching uncontrollably, thinking I'm going to literally die, as that was the only thought I could process. 



Realizing I can't help what's going on, I realize if I do make it out alive, time would be the only thing that could save me. I paced back and forth around my room for about 2 hours, seeing as how my sister and her boyfriend are asleep in the other rooms, and the darkness scared me at the time. I could also barely see. It eventually reaches the point where it's so bad, I pray. I'm Agnostic, I've always believed religion to be silly just due to the fact of so much arguements and controversy on the topic. I pray and I keep thinking `Please let me live, I'll never never never never do it again, I'll try to be a better person, please please please let me live through this, I'd die any other way, just not like this.', memories of me and my ex girlfriend, and other things flashed through my mind as I kept pacing back and forth. 



About another hour of walking around my room and 400 pushups (the slowness of breath from this really tripped me out), I eventually pass out, not remembering if I actually passed out or was able to sleep at some point, but I do remember the twitching get better later on. I wake up at 5:00 AM for school, I fell asleep last night at about 2:00 AM. I'm still high, but it's more mellow, still feels as if I just smoked 2 joints, but at least it's not out of control. I was happy beyond belief when I realized I was alive that morning. I go to school, still have the feelings of being stoned until first block ends, so until about 8:00 AM. Everything is normal except for anxiety of the events from last night. It had been the worst day of my life. 



I remember reading about JWH-018 being a full agonist for the CB1 and CB2 receptors and THC just being partial, I understand what that means now, I bet it CAN be deadly if smoked too much, unlike THC, whereas you'd just feel extremely high. People that died from this were probably smoking blunts of it and other high amounts, not knowing the risk. 



I just have to say please be responsible, and be VERY CARFUL with the dosage of this substance and other cannabinoid analogs, I would prefer death over the feelings I've had, sorry if I didn't go into too much detail, this was about a month ago, but I kept wanting to post it without finding the time. Thanks for reading!
