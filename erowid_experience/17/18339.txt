After a *very* long week, I decided to drop out of reality for a few hours.  My orders of Salvia had not come in yet, so I went in search of some Morning Glory.  Since it is very late in the season, I was unable to locate any.  So I turned to DXM.  I have dosed on DXM before, but only had minor visual distortions and that was with a full bottle of 10mg per 5mL in an 8 oz bottle.  I had planned on picking up 2 bottles, but when I noticed that the dose per 5mL in the brand I bought was 15mg per 5mL, I figured 1 8oz bottle would be enough.



I went home.  Right now I'm living with my parents again.  I just moved, so my whole family (my wife, 2 kids and I) are all living in a rather small house.  So I was afraid too much negative tension would derail an otherwise good trip.



I dosed up about 830 pm.  1 full bottle, 237mL of fluid equaled out to 711mg's of DXM.  I tipped back the bottle and thought to me self, let the journey begin.



Last time I dosed it took me approx 1 hour before the onset of any effects.  But something was different this time.  I walked into the living room and I was feeling a little queazy.  I'm sure the Diet Vanilla coke and Necco wafer candies were not doing any help.  The TV was on..and it was starting to aggravate me really bad.  So I retired to my bedroom.  We always have classical music on, so I was relaxed.



1 hour after I dosed it hit me.  I got extremely sick to my stomach.  I didn't expect this seeing as the only active ingredient was DXM and I didn't have anything like this happen the last time I dosed up.



I got up to go to the bathroom and I knew something was wrong.  I felt very drunk and I was having a hard time focusing on anything.  I made it to the bathroom and vomited just as soon as I could get the seat up.  I then called for my wife.  The experience was very unnerving.  I was slipping away and not in a good way.  I kept trying my hardest to refocus and not to freak out, which was not a very easy thing to do.  My wife was very comforting.  Just 1 of the key aspects to a good tripsitter.  I vomited about 3 times, mostly water.  I don't believe I lost much of the DXM..as I made sure to drink LOTS of water.



I was feeling MUCH better.  I made my way back to my bed.  This is when things got intense.  Now my whole night had been ruined by my vomiting.  My mind had switched from a night of fun to questions like `did I take too much, was I going to die, did my parents find out.'  All the questions of paranoid frantic fear. It wasn't but 930 now and I was burning up.  Or so it felt.  My wife kept assuring me I was fine, sweating and clammy, but not very hot.  Now my vision was all jacked up.  Like being cross-eyed and getting your eyes stuck.  I could not focus on anything.  So I closed my eyes.



Slowly creeping around the edges of where my vision would be if my eyes were open, stars started to appear, until all I could see was a vast expanse of stars.  Like being in a planetarium.  Everywhere I could see were stars and somehow, I was part of them.  I was then disturbed by an odd feeling of being lost, this is where my sitter came in handy.  I needed to be anchored in the real world and nothing around me helped except human touch.  When I would open my eyes to talk to my wife, it was like reality would slam back into existence.  Almost like changed slides in a projector.  Things kept getting harder and harder to keep in mind.  The next few hours kept flashing between stars and `other dimensions'(my wife later told me that I kept saying how much of a shame it would be that I would not remember the things I was seeing) and reality.



All in all the night was not totally ruined, but it could have been.  If not for a good sitter I would have totally freaked out and panicked.  I have yet to have what I would call a bad trip, but I got a taste of one..and it is not something I would like to repeat.
