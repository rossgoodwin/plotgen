This is a report of my first encounter with Salvia.

It was March 21st, 2006.



I had ordered an ounce of dried Salvia leaves (not extract) from an online source. I had been a little wary, because local head shops sold Salvia in my city in California for between 20 and 70 dollars a gram, depending on the potency (10x, 20x, and 40x), which was really expensive, in my opinion. So instead I ordered an ounce of the plain dried leaves, for about fifteen dollars after shipping. I had been expecting an amount about equal to an ounce of cannabis. What I got was a huge bag (relative to an equal amount of pot) of flat, extremely dry and easy to crumple leaves. I was excited.



I called one of my roommates and good friends, J, and another roommate, S, into the room. He decided he wanted to go first, so I crushed up about three leaves into three seperate piles on a sheet of paper. I did this because we planned to use our bong to smoke the Salvia, but we didn't have a very large bowl for it, and the leaves were big. I loaded about half a leaf worth of crushed material into the bowl, and he smoked it in one hit. While he held the smoke, I quickly packed the second half of the first leaf in the bowl. He exhaled, and smoked the second half a leaf. His face looked a little flushed, but he seemed ok. After his second hit, he reported feeling the sensation of an invisible force `pulling' in his head. He also said his clothes felt itchy `like I wasn't wearing a shirt and rolling around in a pile of dried leaves.' He got up, with some protest from me, and immediately laid down on the floor, laughing.



He remained there for several minutes, but I was anxious to try it so I loaded a half-leaf bowl and smoked it myself. I didn't feel anything at first, and I loaded and smoked the second bowl. I immediately felt altered but I wasn't sure quite how. I noticed that the room seemed to be very hot, almost suffocating. It was a small room, with three people in it and no airflow, so I wasn't sure how much of this was the Salvia and how much was real until later when I realized it wasn't hot in my room at all. I took off my jacket, and laid back on the bed. I kept looking over at S and J, who were both laughing, and I began laughing too. I recalled reading something about the effects of Salvia, one of which was `uncontrollable laughter.' This made me laugh even harder. It subsided a few minutes later, the room felt cooler, I felt less itchy, and I was back to normal, for the most part. I did feel good, and I felt like it was a positive experience. However, I was a little disappointed that I hadn't had any real visuals, or any of the bizarre sounding experiences other people I've read about have had. 



Maybe twenty minutes later, I decided I needed privacy. They had moved on to other activities, so I locked my door, closed the blinds and turned off all but one light. I had been listening to Pink Floyd, and I let it keep playing. I loaded a more densely packed bowl of Salvia, this time almost getting an entire leaf in there. I smoked it in one hit, and repacked the bowl with minimal difficulty. I smoked the second bowl, which was the rest of the first leaf and half of another. I put the bong down, and I felt a very strong urge to lay down. I slipped out of my slippers (lol, ironic) and took off my jacket again. I laid face down on my bed, and felt the sensation of swimming.



It was hard to recall all the images I saw, but the ones that stuck out most poignantly were, I was imagining myself working in a factory, or on a farm, somewhere where there would be an over seer. Maybe a plantation? It was a little unclear but it was a huge work facility of some kind. The word `ant' kept popping into my mind as well, but I was unclear as to how it worked into the illusion. The ant was the overseer, as far as I could tell, but I couldn't see it, I only felt its existence. I began to thrash about, not violently, but it felt good to roll around and move back and forth on my bed. I reached up towards the sky with my right arm, over and over, almost like I was doing some exercise that didn't make sense. I felt as if, my job on the factory-farm, was to keep repeating that motion. After a while, it could have been 10 seconds, it could have been a minute, I thought to myself, `what the hell am I doing? This is ridiculous.' Then, I thought, `I better get back to work or I'm going to get in trouble for slacking off.' That's the last real clear thought I had, I did some more weird arm sky grabbing gestures, then I don't really remember what happened after that; a brief come down and then I sat and thought about it all for a while.



The third time I smoked Salvia (This is all in the same day as the other two still, maybe a few hours later) I smoked it with cannabis. It was much different, and it was really more of a long lasting cannabis high, as I remember it. J and myself decided to go for a walk to a park nearby, and I was sitting outside waiting for him to get ready. I was staring at the concrete sidewalk of our patio, and seeing various changing images, mostly abstract, in it. I also saw neon wavy lines in the warped boards of our fence.



The fourth, and final time for the day, was the most interesting and amusing. I was sitting at my computer, alone in my room, talking on instant messenger to a friend of mine. I distinctly remember thinking, `I'm a little tired, I'd like to have one more little trial before I go to bed.' I walked across the room to my night stand where I keep my smoking material, not more that 10 feet away from my computer. I sat down on my bed, crushed up approximately a leaf and a half and smoked it in two bowls. By the time I set the bong down, before I even exhaled the second hit, I had no idea what was going on. It is a hard thing to describe, but I imagine it would be similar to waking up in a room you've never been in, maybe in a foreign country, and having no memory of anything that happened before that moment. I didn't remember where I was, or what I had been doing.



My original plan was to go back to talking to my friend online after I smoked, but I wasn't even aware of the computer in the room. Gravity felt weird, definitely different, but I was still able to walk around with some difficulty. I didn't make the connection I was feeling this way because I just smoked, as far as I knew this was reality. I didn't know what was going on, all I felt was a vague sense of, I'm supposed to be doing something. So I put on my jacket (with much difficulty) then I took it back off, opting to put a shirt on first, so I didn't look `like a maniac.' I slowly walked out into the living room, where S was watching TV on the couch. Her expression was very strange although I don't know why. I saw the cat, I picked him up, and I distinctly remember saying, `Burt! You're so ugly' (the only thing I said out loud during my entire little journey) and laughing like a madman, I dropped the poor, confused cat and walked back into my room.



I laid back down on my bed, realizing what was going on, and after a minute or two, I was back to normal, with a slight afterglow that made me feel positive. I looked at my play list to see how much time had elapsed, because I rememebered which song had just been starting when I went to smoke. That song had played, and it was the end of the next, so approximately 8 minutes of knowing nothing. There was a vague feeling of everything being familiar, but I couldn't form a single definite thought about much of anything, I just referred to everything in my mind as the thing, shape, stuff, `that', etc. 



So I had several different kinds of experiences all by doing close to the same amount of Salvia. Pretty weird stuff, but I loved it, and I will gladly do it again, probably soon. I'm glad I had a sitter (S) the first time, but I definitely felt it easier to `let go' and get absorbed in the fantasy when I was by myself. I think this is more a facet of my personality, rather than of Salvia, because I've felt similar feelings with LSD. Not the effects, but rather, I feel like I can experience the true nature of both substances when I am alone, and don't have to worry about other people's reactions to my strange behavior.
