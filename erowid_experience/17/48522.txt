Well a little background. I'm 16, and I like drugs and writing. When I'm not high I like to write about being high, I guess you could say I have a bit of an obsession. Anyhow, it was a Saturday night, my Friday was uneventful, so I really wanted to have a blast. I've had bad experiences with E (don't confuse with MDMA, I'm not talking about the pure shit) in the past, but for some reason I always get the urge to do it again, probably due to how social and confident I get,



So I got a green butterfly, and all I've heard are good things. After an intense night of running around buying/trading random substances, my buddy came over at about 9:00. Luckily with him came money, so we bought some weed. I snorted the pill at about 10:30, and the night began. We hung around for a while, and at about 12:00 we went out and blazed, knowing my parents would be home in an hour. I know what your thinking, I just skipped an hour and a half of my E high, but most substances seem to take longer to hit me than most people, even through snorting.



As we headed out at 12:00 I could feel the E starting to hit me. I had a nice little buzz, and I was walking with a new level of confidence. I noticed I was talking with a tone in my voice that made it seem like I was superior to my friend, which I tried to stop doing, but it was extremely difficult. I felt great, and that was that. Sadly, we only got a few hits from the fat joint we rolled, due to the wind, so it was just enough to add to my buzz, and my friend said he only felt it a bit as well, mind you he smokes a lot less weed than I do.



On the way back we slid down the roads (very icy), by sprinting then stopping quickly to slide. A very childish act, and I was hit with a lot of warmth. I felt like a little kid, and it was just really fun to be playful and not care. Not long after we arrived back at my place, my parents came home. By this point it was about 1:00. Before my mom went out for the evening, we had gotten in a huge fight. Now I was feeling so warm and empathetic, that that had seemed to be forgotten, and we talked for an hour. I just couldn't stop talking, I was so happy.



I'd like to point out that I could still barely feel the E, physically at least. There was no joy from touching things or moving around, physically I felt very sober, the high came more from my mindset. My mom doesn't know about my drug use, so of coarse I was a little conserned, but I was able to pass as sober, so I guess that was pretty much the case. After my parents went to bed, we waited a while for them to fall asleep before our night continued. During this time, I began to feel some speedy effects from the E. My heart was racing, and I was very uncomfortable sitting down and doing nothing. My friend commented on how I couldn't stop talking, which I found rather funny.



Now it was about 3:00 am, and we felt safe to continue the night. We blazed about a gram of weed each, and I felt a nice high because I hadn't blazed in a good week, a long time for me. My friend complained he wasn't very high, which bummed me out a bit, but I was too happy to care much. Things were going so well, I decided to bust out the salvia. Now due to the fact that I had blazed a fair amount by this point, it was becoming difficult to tell whether or not the E was still effecting me much, but I was still rather social, so I'm assuming so. My friend didn't want to try the salvia so I sat down on my bed and loaded the bong.



Methods for smoking the salvia: Well I used a regular bong and a regular lighter. Two apparent no-no's, but it definately did the trick, so I'm not sure whats up there.



This part will be difficult to describe, due to the intensity of the trip, but I will do my best to put it into words. Might I add that this salvia doesn't seem to be extract. I was told it was upon purchase, but I think I was jipped. I'm pretty sure it's just the leaves, still in full leaf form. It was around 4:00 am when I hit it.



So I loaded the bowl and started hitting it. First hit gave me a little salvia buzz, the second hit and I was really feeling it. By the third, I was getting mild hallucinations upon closing my eyes, by the fourth my body started to feel extremely strange. I was sweating huge by this point, and my thoughts were starting to wander, but the one thought that stayed stable was `Keep hitting it!!!'. 5th hit, I knew I was in for a big trip, and after the 6th I knew I was done. It took me about 4 minutes to take the 6 hits, holding each one in from 10-30 seconds.



I put my bong on the ground, closed my eyes, and just started laughing. I was able to control this laugher enough to be quiet, due to the fact that my parents were sleeping in the room next to mine, but it was extremely difficult. Why was I laughing? Because I had been launched into another world.



Previous to this I haven't gotten satisfactory effects with the salvia, decent mild visuals and a tripped out mindset, but that's about it. This time, well lets just say it was more than satisfactory. With my eyes closed, I saw myself from in front of me, looking directly at my face. I could see my friend chillin on a chair behind me and everything. I quickly opened my eyes because I got a little freaked out, and everything was back to normal, so I went back to closing my eyes and seeing from this new perspective.



I saw myself (although I had my eyes open), and I had the hugest grin on my face from laughing, which made me laugh harder, which made the image of me laugh harder, which made me laugh even harder. This repeated for a while, and I noticed this pattern, which I thought was extremely funny in itself.



Then BOOM! I really started to trip hard. 



I'm not sure if my perspective stayed the same, but all I know is I could still see myself, my friend, and the room from some view. It seemed extremely detailed but at the same time I couldn't focus on anything, if that makes any sense. All of a sudden this new view became 3D. The image was still 2D, but it seemed as if it was a moving picture, and someone was applying pressure in certain points behind this picture, pushing some parts forward.



As I said this is extremely difficult to describe, but I'm doing my best. Eventually places in this picture were pushed out as far as they were going to go, and it remained this way for quite some time. Because I was a part of this picture, I actually `felt' where it had been pushed forward. This is one of those weird feelings such as melting or being stretched, that really can't be understood by someone who hasn't experienced them, but either way, it was damn insane.



Then I started to see tiny hands pop up in random places around the image. I saw hands on a previous salvia trip as well, which I thought was strange. The image began to quickly loose focus, and soon the only thing that could be seen clearly were these hands. They would pop up in more and more random spots, and they were wiggling their fingers franticly. I'd like to add that they were extremely tiny, in perspective, I'd say the amount of hands needed to cover my entire field of vision would have been maybe 500x500. I can't actually put it in perspective with the objects I saw, due to the fact that the actual image was 2D, even though the picture had been pushed forwards in some places to look 3D.



Eventually my entire vision was covered in these hands. All moving their fingers identically. I was hit with a sense of panic, similar to the fear that hit me as the trip began. I guess I could describe it as a fear that I was going to trip harder than I've ever tripped before, and that I would lose control, there was always the fear of being too loud, because of my parents.



Again I thought about opening my eyes, but quickly assured myself it would be okay. I'd only tripped out this hard once before, and this was the kind of high I always seek, so I wasn't about to risk giving it up by opening my eyes. This is about when I realized I hadn't been in my body for as long as I could remember. I had actually completely forgotten about it, I was simply this image/picture that I saw. I could see it, and I WAS it. I WAS these hands, and I could feel every single one of their fingers moving.



Upon remembering my body, I quickly went back to it, although all my focus was on my head. I knew I had arms/legs etc, but I couldn't really feel them or care about them. I could still feel these hands moving around in my head, but at the same time, they simply became another visual. I knew the short peak was over, and it was time to enjoy the comedown, which proved to be rather intense in itself.



This image of hands became completely still, and they slowly turned into a brown stone wall. I came to the conclusion that I was looking into my brain. Probably because I could only really `feel' my head. I was upset by the fact that I now had the chance to see what drives my every thought, only to find out that it was just a stone wall. It looked `dead'. And that was it. I was still happy to be tripping, but sorrow was creaping up on me. Lately I've been bothered by the fact that my grades are slipping, and I haven't exactly been productive. I guess it was coming at me full blown now. I thought that this was the trip telling me that I am essentially nothing. I think my mind is so active, yet in reality it is nothing. This along with the fact that I had constantly moving visuals for what seemed like a very long time. Going from infinate movement from no movement at all is a big change, so it probably exaggerated the fact even more.



At this point I knew the trip was going sour, so I opened my eyes. It's amazing how sober I felt upon doing this, it's like I put the trip on hault. I opened my window and turned on my fan to air the smoke out, and noticed my friend had left my room, so I decided to go to bed myself. I still felt `weird', but there were no visuals or weird mindset at this point. 



So I got into my bed, and turned the lights off, and closed my eyes again. Amazingly the trip seemed to start right back up. Not as intense of coarse, but pretty much where it had left off. I saw `the wall' again, but I didn't really seem to care as much now. Suddenly, the hands started to appear again, which picked my spirits up a bit. All of a sudden I could feel them inside my head again, but now all the moving fingers turned into little kids. It seemed as if there were millions of them, slowly taking over where the wall had once been. It was as if they were eating away at it, making my brain active once more.



They went through every nook and cranny of my brain, and one thing I remember visually seeing was these children filling up a spiral of what was once this dark stone wall, slowly creeping their way through the entire thing. These children didn't exactly seem to be intelligent, but they knew they were helping me out somehow, and in a sense I guess that's what matters. They were making my brain active again, and filling it with creativity. I got the impression that they were told to do this by some being, although I never really encountered this being first hand. For some reason I got the impression that s/he was a teacher, and these children were his/her students.



This is how the main trip ended, so I was happy it ended on a positive note. After this I proceeded to munch out as I fell asleep, and enjoyed my weed high, but I had one rather funny thought I think I should share, because it was just so whack that it was funny. After eating a chocolate bar I noticed that my gums were covered in chocolate, due to my braces. For some reason I came to the conclusion that I was in an intamite relationship with my gums, and I was just feeling them with my tounge, meeting up with them again for the first time in a while, and I was shocked and insulted to taste the chocolate lodged everywhere. It was as if I was finding stuff like articles of clothing, and dirty condoms, things that would make me think my gums were cheating on me. Every time I found a new piece of chocolate it was like another dagger to my heart; another piece of evidence that my gums were dirty cheaters. After repeating this to myself over and over so I would remember when I sobered up it finally hit me `Oh yeah. I'm high, does this really make sense?' and then I laughed at how much of an idiot I am and fell asleep.
