We had recently aquired a new personal catalogue of tryptamines to sample from.  I was very excited about our new finds, because I've been very familiar with 2C-E, 2C-I, 5-MeO-DMT, and 5-MeO-MiPT, but I hadn't had much experience at all with 4-substituted tryptamines, and felt that they had something to offer me.  So now that my friends and I had established a good stock to experiment with, we decided to go for it one night.  Only two of us would be tripping, my girlfriend was present, but wouldn't be joining us.  The setting was at my home, we have a very neutral, earthy living room and decor, so it helps keep things mellow. The entertainment of the evening was a Les Claypool DVD my buddy brought over, and a Red Hot Chili Peppers DVD so we could watch the wallpaper.



4-AcO-MiPT fu., (+1 hr)4-AcO-MiPT,  5-MeO-MiPT, (+2 hr) 10mg 4-HO-DET fu.



(0:00) We eat 20mg of 4-AcO-MiPT fu.  I expected 20mg to be a very strong dose, because it had been the week before. the visuals had been exceptional.  We put the dose into a spoonful of peanut butter, and down it went.



(0:30) starting to notice alerts, this stuff comes on pretty gently, almost too much so, it feels like we're not getting anywhere.  At this point we alter the lighting in the room and set ourselves in for the trip.  We changed out the lights and put a nice deep blue hue in the room with colored bulbs, a lava lamp and blacklight.



(1:00) Now we're feeling the 20mg, but its not quite a strong as we wanted, there's some visuals, but they can be ignored, somewhere like a ++.  So we decide that a bump is definitely in order, so I measured out another 18mg and split it in half, more peanut butter.



(1:30) The bump we'd taken begins to come into effect.  Some of the miprocetyn patterns emerge.  My buddy prefers it to be dark, but I like the light because textures and patterns in the carpet really come out.  But in the dark, there seems to be a lot of dimension shifting and bending, so I don't protest.  Its somewhere around this time that I think how nice it would be to mix some moxy into things.  So I then vaporized about 5-6mg in two piles.  Each time I would take a hit and hold it, a warm rush of sensory awareness would come over me, and an electrical joy would seep into me and spill through my body.  It felt like ecstasy (the state, not MDMA).  In that moment, everything seemed to freeze, and a warm and inviting presence would sweep me away.  I wish i could recall if this affected the visuals at all, but I can't.  It did make me more focused on them, though, I do recall that.



(2:00) My buddy was also interested in piggy backing, but wasn't sure he wanted to smoke out of an essential oil pipe\ldots something taboo.  Instead, we had talked about bumping with some ethocin (4-HO-DET).  Miprocetyn has a very warm, open, social feeling/vibe to it, and its perfect for philosophizing.  ethocin, on the other hand, is a wonderful meditory tool, it has a definite bent towards the infinite and spiritual.  We were dying to know how that would mix with the miprocetyn, so we each took 10mg of the fumarate salt, which is only about 6.5mg of the freebase.



(-:--)This was ten o'clock when we took the ethocin, and it usually takes about an hour to 1.5hrs to come on.  During this time we sat and chilled and goofed off.  It was a very liberating high feeling where laughter comes natural and from the soul.  I think we kept DVD's running this whole time.



(4:00) Around midnight now, and my buddy's feeling it all really strong, we both sit and space out for a while and meditate.  For some reason, I only felt a slight buzz from the ethocin, and that was just because I felt chilled. Miprocetyn doesn't make me cold, ethocin does.  So I just slip into meditation, and try to open up my perception.  The CEV's at this point are absolutely indescribable, multi-dimensional planes of color abstraction that seemed bizarrely digital.  This whole experience carried a strong force of philosophies of cognitive sciences.  During the whole trip, I felt preoccupied with the concept of synthetic vs. natural.



(4:30-5:00) Now that my buddy had come down a bit from his jaunt, I seemed to have a delayed reaction to mine.  By this time, my girlfriend had come down, and she and my buddy were sitting in the room chatting.  I'm not aware of how it started, but they were talking about ghosts, and a haunting involving the Civil war, soldiers, and their ghosts.  She began describing the things people would report experiencing, such as smelling soldiers, hearing footsteps, etc, etc.  But suddenly, I began to move rapidly out of my center of awareness and it was getting lost somewhere else in my head.  When she was talking, just by me hearing and understanding the meaning of the words, it was making the perception real.  Sudddenly I was surrounded by a civil war camp with soldiers around me, and bootsteps, and their smell, but this layer of awareness was separate from other layers going on, and I couldn't differentiate between any of them.  I couldn't tell which layer was reality and lock in on it, and began to lose my concept of self into the awareness.  All I could do at that point was start smacking my hand on the floor so she would stop talking and maybe I could explain what just happened.  Because as long as she was talking, it was impossible for my head to get straight.



Some point after this, I began to have flashes about the nature of awareness.  And I realized that all biological life, through evolution, has been moving to organism that can define reality at a higher and higher perspective, with humans being the pinnacle of that currently.  Part of us being human (and natural) is that we do create and define reality, and if we were to create super-intelligent, sapient beings who can produce, operate, and replicate themselves, then that too is a form of life, and no less synthetic than ourselves.  The concept of synthetic has arisen out of an anthropocentric view of reality, and that view has been shown to be fallable and incorrect, therefore, synthetics too must be recognized as an invalid concept.



I saw possible futures through the effects of technology.  First, universal chipping, then neural-chipping so our minds are the internet and the world a computer screen, then universal awareness, then super-intelligent sapient machines who we share our awareness with, then we become the machines altogether.  Organisms that adapt to a changing environment survive, and those that don't adapt, die.  The environment's changing, we changed it, and now we have to adapt to it.  But the environment's changing in a way that may make it incapable of supporting biological life, Then an organism must adapt by findind a new platform on which to support its awareness.  Might that awareness be a universal technological consciousness?  If that were so, our habitable environment would suddenly radically be changed, moreso than when we found out the world was round.  Suddenly, all of 3 dimensional space would be our habitable environment, no longer constrained by biological limitations.  new beings could be instantly conceived and created, ready to recieve the internet-hook up of conscious-awareness.  This new organism would spread, discover, reveal, and colonize.  Eventually, a technological fuzz would grow and develop over all the physical bodies in space, like so much cosmic mold.  That's the future, and that's where we're headed, now just to wait and ride it out.



This was definitely a ++++ experience.
