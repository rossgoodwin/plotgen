Previous experiences include experimentation with lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psylocybin (mushrooms), salvia divinorum, dimethyltryptamine, lysergic acid amides (morning glory seeds), and 4-acetoxy di-isopropyl tryptamine (4-Ace DiPT). Daily cannabis user.



[This report is word for word what I wrote down in my notebook while under the influence of 2C-I. Anything in brackets either indicates a misspelled word or an anecdote added afterwards.]



Date: 4/8/2009 

Time: 20:15



Subject: 20 year old male, approx. 250 lbs, 5'10'

Ingested same dose approx. 22 hours earlier to this account. Already under influence of cannabis.



(T+0:00)

20:15

Ingested 7.4 mg of 2,5 dimethoxy-4-iodine-phenethylamine (2ci), 60 mg 5L-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), and 25 mg of vitamin B6.



(T+0:15)

20:30

Ate sandwich, smoked cigarette. Nothing happening yet. Able to type fast on computer.



(T+0:30)

20:45

Experiencing slight tremors in hands, along w/ lightheadedness. No nausea yet. Slight trouble walking. Pupil dilation apparent. Feeling rush in torso.



(T+0:45)

21:00

Slight hallucinations in periphial [sic] vision. Prominent nausea in abdomen. Still able to drive and have conversation w/ police. [was pumping gas and a security guard commented on my bumper stickers]  \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#   Arrived at destination (park), had run in w/ late night bikers, intense paranoia, feer [sic], jitters. All OK though.



(T+0:50)

21:05

Ingested 100mg 5-HTP and pop tarts. Taste is heightened, vision is pure and clear.



(T+ 1:15)

21:30

Feels like forever since my last entry. Nausea is incredible. Stars and planes in sky have bright halos/ rays emitting from them. Clouds moving w/ wind seem to `glitch' and return to previous positions.



(T+1:30)

21:45

Nausea still in effect. Smoked cannabis to alleviate symptoms. Time dilation now very pronounced.



(T+1:45)

22:00

Smoked more cannabis, nausea subsiding. Trees in dark look very surreal. Visuals warping, very scary, unable to write about feelings.



(T+1:55)

22:10

Waves of understanding staring at trees. This isn't happening. How was it only 10 minutes since my last entry. Clouds in sky turning into faces that fade away and form into different faces upon refocusing my vision. Planes and stars shift around like `UFO's.' Profound inner understanding. Subject removed jacket, unable to fully sense outside temperatures, Eyes feel somewhat burned/ sore. Time dilation in full gear, my visions are changing. No longer able to write consistently in proper tense.



(T+2:08)

22:23

Unable to do mental math as fast as possible. Hearing ambulance sirens in my ears even though friends around me assure me that an ambulance was in the distance several minutes ago but stopped. Everything seems to be looping. Beginning to feel cold temperature of outside air. 

	

Skyline waving back and forth in layers. Clouds in sky taking on pink hue, sky begins turning purple, moon is full and illuminating the rock I'm sitting on. Feel as if my body is melting into the rock and swirling downhill. Paranoid overtakes all, experience begins to slide into a faint salvia session, minus the pain. `Falling' sensation wearing off, thought loops start becoming overwhelming. Teeth are clenched, mind reminisces back to experiences on LSD, in both paranoia and `body buzz' sensation. Fear leads on to desire to leave setting in preferrence [sic] of `safer' area. Nausea present actually reminds me more of the first wave of a morning glory seed trip.



(T+2:45)

23:00

Arrived at friend's house. Drove to new destination at speeds not exceeding 35 mph on city streets. Went to 7-11 after parking on street, almost lost debit card inside store. While walking to friend's house, had feeling I could walk for miles, however I was only walking about a couple thousand feet at most. Nausea comes in waves now, most likely the 5-HTP, not sure though. Everything slightly more clear headed. Still have slight jitters, but waves of paranoia from before are all but gone. Felt primal instincts earlier due to fight or flight reflexes to perceived environmental threats around me (that didn't really exist). Able to look back and have hindsight.



(T+3:15)

23:30

Incredible lightheadedness, feeling of connectivity to something. Very difficult to focus on continuing writing. Distinct speech impedements [sic] persisting.



(T+3:45)

00:00

Posters on wall seem to be moving, back and forth, as if they each have individual depth perceptions. Audible hallucinations consist of looped background/ white noise caused by ventilation system, sometimes so deafening I have ringing in my ears. My ears themselves [feel] like they are adjusting to pressure shifts as if I'm driving up a mountain.



(T+3:53)

00:08

Smoked more cannabis, looping going away, lightheadedness still strong, strange euphoria surrounds. Eye muscles twitching uncontrollably. 



(T+4:00)

00:15

Everything I eat tastes amazing. My jaws ache from clenching my teeth. I have not smoked a single cigarette (in reality) for hours, though the tension I feel is as if I haven't had a cigarette in weeks. I need to close my eyes. I have completely broken character.



(T+4:15)

00:30

Closed eye visuals were a much appreciated rest to my aching eyes. ONly way to describe CEV's would be to imagine spider webs pulsing in bright neon light. Nausea soming in mild waves, vision still has distortion in terms of depth perception.



(T+4:30)

00:45

TV audio flanging in my left ear. Vision has expanded to beyond periphial [sic] corners of my eye, feels like my mind is making things up in anticipation I might see something. My friends, sitting on the couch for the past hour, stood up in the corner of my left eye (which did not happen in real life).



(T+5:00)

01:15

Lightheadedness returned in force, audio hallucinations all but gone. Depth perception still wavering. Standing up is possible, but proves difficult.



(T+5:30)

01:45

Feels as if peak is finishing off and clear headededness is returning. Effects subsiding a little bit.



(T+5:55)

02:10

Orally ingested 1200 mg of Soy Lecithin to aid w/ nausea. Mild headache coupled w/ sweating. Will probably smoke some more cannabis soon.



(T+6:00)

02:15

Subject smoked more cannabis. Previously mentioned physical conditions all but gone, experiencing cold sensations/ chills.



(T+6:30)

02:45

Visions warping sideways and diagonally. Time is still very dilated. Subject feeling fatigue. Leaving friend's house, need sleep.



(T+7:15)

03:30

Back at home. Drove at speeds of about 35 mph. At stoplights, streetlights remind me of christmas lights swaying in the breeze. Cooked some eggs. Then smoke pancakes.



(T+7:45)

04:00

About to go to sleep. Eyes very sore. Will summarize report later.



Summary: This experience was very pleasant. I ate the same dose the day before and tripped about the same amount of time, but did not thoroughly document the experience. I ended up taking more 5-HTP to help potentiate the trip, since I felt my serotonin levels from the previous day may have been depleted, and I wanted to trip harder. I do believe that taking the supplement actually helps improve the trip (especially body buzz and visuals), I have taken up to 25 mg of 2C-I in the past and didn't feel as awesome as I did that night, I liken this to the fact that I had almost 200 mg of 5-HTP in my system (60 from the cutting agent in the pill, 100 or so from a capsule I took with me to the park). All in all, I STRONGLY advise against driving or going out in public under the influence of this substance. While going to clubs/ bars/ raves is great on phenethylamines, trespassing into a park after sunset will definitely cause (as Hunter S. Thompson eloquently puts it) extremely menacing vibrations, and will ultimately cause intense paranoia. The particular park I went to was right next to a bike trail, and when you're tripping and you see a bright light on top of a hill while you're trying to jump a fence, most people would generally assume it's a cop and that they're screwed. Thankfully this was not the case. 



I trip in a place I am very comfortable in, smoke some cigarettes, smoke some cannabis to alleviate nausea (I've always had nausea on it but have never thrown up from eating food, even when taking epic doses). 



All in all, I enjoyed this experience very much, and I'm very glad I documented it. I would suggest taking 2C-I at night, because when it's dark outside, what little light there is around will play with my visuals a lot, everything will be seen in better contrast and more vividly than normal. I'll never be able to look at natural things like rocks or trees or bodies of water the same way again. If I want a nice amalgamated experience of psychedelics, 2C-I resembles a good blend of most everything out there (LSD, mushrooms, ecstacy, etc.) It's a class of it's own, it is its own animal, so to speak, definitely worth trying. I've had quite a good time on doses even as small as 5-6 mg (with the proper potentiating supplements, of course.) Now I am very excited about the possible future advent of ingesting the chemical this substance was based from; 3,4,5 trimethoxyphenethylamine (mescaline). I wonder how it compares\ldots
