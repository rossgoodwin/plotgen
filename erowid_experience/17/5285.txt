My friend T and me are visiting our buddies L and K in New York for the night. We spent most the day not doing much besides smoking some weed, salvia and a couple hits off some poppers. We ate dinner around 6:30 at good old Mickey D's. Went out around 11:00 to Twilo to see Carl Cox and Danny T. spin. Well we saw Carl Cox spin, fucking amazing, totally and absolutely seamless; he sure knew how to work the crowd.  Anyways, we couldn't deal with the `club crowd' anymore, so we took off around 2:00 in the morning, came back to L's apartment, and decided we would have our own after party.



As we get to the apartment, me and T find out that L has a 40 jar of K for us, so we split it between the two of us, while L takes a 40 jar for himself.  T and I decide we would dive into the world of 2C-T-7 that night. We decided that 8mg. insulfated should be good, considering we hadn't eaten since 6:30 that night we should be A-OK!  Well Up the hatch it goes at about 2:30 I guess.  The burn wasn't as bad as my first time, we mixed it in with about 2 bump of K and just made a nice little line out of it, I think the K helped to minimize the burn a lot, but it didn't stop the nasty taste of T7 in the back of our throats.  We were going to try and mix it in with some crystal light pink lemonade powdered mix, but I tried a bump of it before we were going to mix it, and shit man, that stuff burns like a sonofabitch, but it sure tasted nice.



Well L wasn't doing the T7 with us, he just laid out about 1/2 of his 40 jar and railed it in 2 blows. Then about 10 minutes later did about 1/2 of what he had left in another blow. Finally about 20 minutes later he finished the last of the jar up. We'll just dismiss him for the rest of the night, he just went into his little K-hole by himself for the rest of the night.



But T and me were in for quite a ride tonight! I'd say about 30 minutes in, we felt the T7 creeping up on us.  T was getting visuals already, so I looked around the room and noticed stuff was swirling and things that were plain in color were all of a sudden blotched with reds, oranges and yellows. We decided this would be a good time to smoke a bowl of some of L's high quality weed.  Within the hour I began to feel a body load come on, it was very intense for me, it felt like the salvia body load I get when I smoke the extracts at first. Anyways, I was enjoying the body load very much, all of a sudden my body felt like it was just floating around the universe, but the only think was that the `universe' consisted of L's apartment, and that's it! It was nuts, I was just dancing around the main room wearing a big blanket like a shaal, just saying random stupid things that came to my mind. All of a sudden it felt like the room was moving with me, almost as if I was dancing with the `universe', very cool.  

The next thing that I remember is two very interesting colors I saw flying down the walls everywhere in binary code form, it was two colors T had shown me earlier in the day on a small football he had in his car. It was a darker fluorescent green and a fluorescent Pink, which he said was what the `color of acid' looked like when he was tripping face on acid once. Well I began to see this color flying around everywhere I looked, it made everything look even more 3 dimensional than it already was, I was utterly amazed by it.



Next I was kneeling on the couch with my stomach pressed up against the back of the couch, and my arms and head were flopped over the edge of the couch as I was talking to T who was lying down on the floor behind the couch.  The body load that was emitted during this period was amazing, I felt as though I was lying down on my stomach in Heaven, and I was peering over the edge looking down at the entire galaxy, which was full of colors and shapes.  My body felt almost like I was lying on the edge of a cliff looking over the edge down at a huge valley.  I even got that shortness of breath you would get from leaning over the edge of a cliff, that nervousness that you might slip and fall, but knew you were safe



Finally when I got up and looked around the room one of the funniest parts of the trip occurred.  As I looked around the room, no longer was there that green and pink Binary Code flying around the room, but it was replaced with old-fashioned black and white Mickey Mouse cartoons, like the Steamboat Willy Cartoon!  I was telling T about what I was seeing, and I started to impersonate Mickey in that cartoon, it was so funny, because I was dancing around like a complete idiot and making funny sounds, we just got a complete kick out of that.  The visuals were flying down the walls in the binary code form, and were also flashing like a strobe light everywhere else in the room that wasn't a wall.  Visuals continued to occur for the remainder of the night, but it would switch what type of visual I saw.  At one point it was all different types of dogs that were flying down the walls and flashing like strobe lights, it was almost overwhelming, but it was real nice visuals, nothing freaky, so I was able to handle it.



Something that occurred all night long was constant auditory hallucination.  Anyways everything and anything that made a sound in that apartment all of a sudden turned into a dance track.  Every noise got a had a constant beat to it, it then would gain bass, background, breaks, sometimes there were vocals too, it was quite interesting.  As I sat on the couch I felt as though I was at a huge party, with every type of music available.  Over in the corner I heard drum and bass booming out of the heater, over in the kitchen I heard booty house coming out of the refrigerator, out of the tall liquid bubble lamp I could hear trance pulsating out. It was very interesting because I could focus on one of the sounds at a time or listen to all of them at once and have an orchestra of sound coming out of the apartment.



The next thing I can remember from that night was me lying down a blanket on the floor, and then sitting on it Indian style. I thought I was sitting on top of a magic carpet, and I flying around the world, it was amazing, wherever I wanted to go I could go.  All I had to do was think of where I wanted to go and my magic carpet would take me there, all the visuals were inside my head though, almost closed eye visuals but not quite, sort of hard to explain. I remember flying over the Golden Gate Bride, New York City, the Pyramids of Egypt, the Eiffel Tower and over the Australian Outback.



One of the last things I remember was taking a bump of K and lying down on the couch, and I began to remember my first trip on T7, and basically the only thing that I got out of that trip was if I heard something from the lyrics of a song or something like that, or thought of something, a visual would pop into my head and come alive, almost like word association, where you say a word or object that first pops into your head when you look at a blob of ink.  So anyways, I then recalled L talking to T and me about being on his K-holes and how he can leave his body and travel anywhere that he wanted to, well I began to think of this, and immediately the T7 found this though in my head and brought it to life, I saw my soul or inner being slip out of the top of my head and float up to the ceiling, I looked down and saw myself lying on the couch smiling, I could see T sitting at the counter in the kitchen taking a bump of K, I could float into L's room and see him passed out in a K-hole with his candle on.  That's all I wanted to travel for the night though, so I flew back to my body and snapped out of it.



I then went upstairs and laid down on the futon and closed my eyes, I was getting sleepy, but the visuals were still going extremely strong, to the point where they prevented me from sleeping, so I went with the flow and kept watching the visuals in my head. What I saw at this point was real fun as well, I was transported back to my childhood, and I got to travel back in time into all the events I was part of as a child.  I was in Vermont camping with my whole family at one point, next I was at my grandparents house for summertime cookouts, then I would be at their house for Christmas time, I also traveled to Cape Cod and went swimming with my little sisters. From this point on I don't remember much, I fell asleep eventually, and remember T coming upstairs a couple times and checking on me to make sure I was ok, and not passed out dead.



I woke up around 9:00 I guess and went downstairs to lay down on the couch.  I couldn't think straight for the life of me, so I just went back to sleep. Woke back up at around noon I guess, smoked a bowl with T and L, and still felt pretty stupid, this stupidity lasted for the entire day.  I don't think the weed helped! Looking back on the trip, it was definitely the most fun I have had during a trip possibly ever, it didn't last too long like AMT, wasn't too powerful like Acid can be, and didn't turn into a freakish hell like 5-MeO-DiPT has done to me a couple times, plus I didn't feel cracked out the next day.  I'm sure had we taken the weed out of the mix, I wouldn't have felt as stupid the following day. This chemical ranks in the top 2 or 3 in my list.
