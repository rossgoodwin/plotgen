About a year ago I took an extremely heavy dose of psychedelic mushrooms. Since then, there hasn't been a day that I haven't thought about what happend to me on this day, which became one of the most frightening, and unexplainable `experiences' in my life. I'm not sure if anything, or anyone could have prepared me for it. I had done mushrooms, 15-20 times before this, but never had anything like this.



Well, a little about myself. At the time, I was 19 years old, I was working at a job I didn't like at all. It kept me far away from my family, friends, and at the time, a girl I loved very much, but couldn't be with due to her unstable mental state.



Overall, life was confusing at the time, I was back home for a few weeks, and so were alot of very close friends I grew up with. I was happy to see all of them, we all agreed, what better way to catch up then hangin out and doing some mushrooms.



Alot of this trip I have to blame on very poor setting. The plan was to go down by a river where we thought we would be left alone. We didn't know it was a common place for people to go for walks, ect. We started by hiking down to the river, we set up our chairs around some rocks near the river, we each had 4 grams of very high grade mushrooms (we had no idea they were so potent, I told my dealer I ate 4 grams and he didn't believe me), mixed them up with some chips and salsa, and chowed them down. While we waited for them to kick in, we decided to smoke some marijuana. About 10 minutes had passes, I felt very giggly, more so then normaly from weed. Immediately after some people going for a walk, walked behind us. We all agreed this was a bad spot. We picked up camp and decided to move about 50 meters down the river, away from the path.



About 20 minutes had passed, we were moving our things, and I was tripping. One of my friends asked `you feeling anything yet?' `I'm a fuckin space cadet.' I replied. I was walking along these rocks, they appeared to be moving and forming a path right in front of me! `Follow me! I know the way!' By this point caring all my equipment was too much for me. I dropped the case of water I was carrying, threw my chair down. I can't explain it, but it felt as if an incredible burden was lifted off my shoulders, it felt great. That feeling was very short lived. I looked over to the river. It was jetting different colours down the water. But the colours didn't move with the water, the whole river just jetted another colour, then another, then another. I looked at all the trees across the water. They were growing, shrinking, trading places. It was way too overwhelming, almost made me sick. Another one of my friends had set up a blanket on the ground, I went and layed down and tried to close my eyes to try escape all this. Didn't work. Upon closing my eyes, I saw a kalediscope of black and white swirls, but they were all in some sort of perfect geometric pattern. This was even more intense for me. My friends started to get concerned, I told them I needed water. They offered me some gatorade, but I wanted nothing to do with it. I needed water, and now. `B' went and grabbed me a bottle of water, from which I dropped back down along the river. I grabbed the bottle and felt as if my quest had been fullfilled, but after drinking it, it did nothing. I layed back down, closed my eyes, and the intense closed eye visuals came back. I jumped up `ants!' I shouted `ants all over me! Get them off!' My friend `B' asked my friends `E' `what is wrong with him?' E replied `he's having a bad trip, my sister told me about this, we gotta just let him play it out.' Bad trip\ldots  The last words I remember hearing conciously, lingering in my mind\ldots 



This is where my trip gets very hard to recall. I had not a clue where I was, how much time had passed, who I was, some of what I recall has just been pieced together from what friends have told me.



My friends were all circled around me. In what seemed like a flash, the whole sky turned black, my friends looked like army soldiers, and the river turned to an ocean of blood. It looked identical to a scene straight out of `saving private ryan.' I felt as if they were helping me. I looked at my lower body\ldots  `oh my god! Where are my legs.' I was certain I was about to die. I can't describe how real this felt, it was horrifying' 



As fast as that `episode' came, it was gone, in a flash I was no longer on normady beach, but on a beach in some jungle\ldots  My friends were now cannibals! They were going to kill me! I got up as fast as I could, ran into the trees\ldots  Upon arriving in this forest, it was a bloody mess. A bear had just been here, and completely oblitirated a hiker. The bear was coming back for me, I thought. Back to the beach I went.



This is the hardest part of the trip for me to recall, and talk about. When I was very young, I was molested, needles to say, I'm an extreme homophobe. It's not to say I'm against gays, but I do not want to be one. 



Back on the beach, I felt somewhat normal, I started to walk around. I thought, for some reason, we were a group of gay people. I walked around, and said `Yeah, were gay.'

My friends G said `I'm not fucking gay'



We started go and back and forth taunting each other, then ended up fighting.



By that time, another friend came because he said hed sit and make sure we were ok the other night. Thank god he was there.



Other then what I have wrote, the rest of the trip is too hard to remember, I was just too messed up. Proabally a good thing I don't. However, the only pleasent part of the trip, that I do remember is the end.

 

All this shit had gone down. I was now lying, staring at the sky. My mind was a complete blank, all these things that just happend to me didn't matter. I felt as if I wasn't connected to my body. I thought for sure, this must be death. But it wasn't like thinking\ldots  It was more, that knew I was. It's a very hard sensation to describe. It felt timeless. And I wanted it to be. 



Eventually, I woke up, in a daze. 



I remember, in my dazed state hearing. `he can't know what happened to him.' 



`what?' I said



`Nothing' one of them replied.



I'm sorry the report is very unfinished, but in that kind of state of mind, it's hard to remember anything. Thank you to anyone who read this. I put it here hoping that someone will be able to relate to it somehow. I also apologize for spelling and grammer mistakes.
