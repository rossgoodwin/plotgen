About an hour or so ago - popped 150mg of tramadol (Ultram) hcl (three

pills so far). 



12:38pm (now) - popped one more to make it 200mg after reading up on the pills online a little bit. feeling mildly sedated but still up at 

the same time. i like this high a lot. i'm waiting for my 

friend to deliver my weed to me. i can't wait for the full 200mg

to kick in so i can see what this stuff is all about.

listening to The Futureheads and it sounds alright. i may be

changing the music soon.



12:42pm - decide to change the music to Gnarls Barkley. definitely feeling the 

pills but i'm not used to them so i don't know what to be expecting

or anything. i'm going to continue reading about the pills. the 

body high kind of feels like ecstasy. somewhat euphoric. mild 

jitters etc.



12:48 - my weed is here!! i'm going to roll up a skimp cigarillo and see if the

weed heightens the high at all. i find myself making a lot of typing

mistakes. finishing up a cigarette. thinking alot about Gnarls Barkley

and how genious the group is. breaking up weed as i write this.



1am - blunt lit. hands were very clumsy and shaky while rolling it. it's very

small but it will do the job. sweating mildly. very jittery. almost

uncomfortable but the weed is chilling me out as i type this.



1:05 - blunt is becoming a roach. feeling very good. very very good. sedated.

dreamy. very good. realizing tramadol and weed is a very very very very

good combo. i may roll up another cigarillo in a little while if i'm

feeling up to it. dazed. i fall into very deep dazes in with the music

every once in a while. thinking about putting on some ambient/electronic

music. hot hot heat is playing at the moment. feeling very lazy.



1:08 - Mouse on Mars - Idiology album begins. i put on a pair of stereo headphones at 1:10. feeling wild. music is very loud in the headphones.



1:14 - turn itunes visualizer on. the visualizer puts me in a daze.



1:17 - slightly numb in my mouth for some reason. i decide to put on a crazy

song by rjd2. no more visualizer for now. very fucked up. smoking a

cigarette. this report is going to be very interesting to read. i've

been reading many reports similar to what is unfolding here. this drug

\ldots  tramadol\ldots . i like this drug. although i got these pills for free..

i would, without a doubt, pay for more. they're very good. i just seem

to keep getting more and more fucked up. I LOVE IT..



1:21 - reading over my report so far. i like it. this is just getting started..

i can tell. RJD2 - 1976 is BANGIN' in my headphones. Ghostwriter by

the same band begins\ldots  sounds very good. music is becoming a journey..

each song is a different journey. all the music i'm playing right now

is instrumental/electronic. so no lyrics. i'm thinking about putting

on some good rock. feeling very good. i go get a cup of water and

turn the light off in my room at 1:25.



1:26 - Such Great Heights - The Postal Service begins\ldots  this music is so

amazing. the heart put into the songs. the postal service is genious.

the pills are great. but i'm just gonna let it flow from here on. the

music causes tons of emotion.. it's all wonderful. i lovvvve this. closing

eyes liping the lyrics. when i close my eyes the music flows through me.

minor CEV's. my body is moving in all sorts of ways to the music. sort

of dancing while sitting down. i don't dance. good feelings are all over

the place at 1:29. 



1:30 - brand new colony - the postal service begins\ldots  i IM a friend. mild

nausia begins. the music is great. i like the faster pace of this track.

there's no way i would want to drive on this drug$<$ that was just a side

note.   \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#  drinking lots of water just to keep hydrated.



1:36 - explosions in the sky starts. i just changed into my night time clothes.

feeling good but tired. debating whether to smoke more weed. myspace

is a very very useful tool. one of the best thing's i've seen in the

2000's. the music is wonderful as usual.



1:43 - music is great. talking to two friends. feeling good. getting

into deep conversation about drugs with one of my friends. almost

coming down. i wanna smoke more weed. i don't feel like rolling a blunt.

feeling dazed and tired but happy. the music is fueling me at the moment.



1:53 - i turn the light on to roll up a cigarillo but i'm trying a different

method of rolling. (using joint roller). hoping it'll work.



2:01 - mini blunt lit. burning nice and slow. it's like a fat joint-sized

cigar. rolled with perfection. it hits like a dream.i'm gonna be 

ripped.



2:07 - the blunt is almost done. i can't believe i just texted the girl of my

dreams.



2:10 - blunt is done. i'm having a flirtatious text message conversation with the

girl of my dreams. WHAT?! i'm for real. explosions in the sky is one

of the best of all time. simple as that. i just felt a very euphoric

feeling. it was very random. but it was welcomed once it came on. this

drug is WILD.



2:14 - i spark up a cigarette. the album `The Rescue' - Explosions in The Sky is

one of the most emotional albums i have ever heard. this band has so

much heart. i love finding REAL MUSIC. Day Three - explosions\ldots . this

track is unbelievable. i'm happy. almost ready for sleep. the cigarette

is very good. camel lights are very rich.



2:18 - appreciatin' my cigs. lol. this drug is minorly similar to ecstasy which

is unbelieveable. the marijuana jets this drug out of control\ldots  but i

love it. this music is CRAZY. 



2:21 - i've calmed down a lot since the beginning of this trip report. i like

it a lot more now than i did then. my mind wonders easily now. but

i can bring it back very fast. the music is still fueling me. this

would be nothing without the music. the soundtrack to this night is

classic because it made my night for me.



2:24 - i decide it's getting late and that it's almost time for sleep. it will

come easily in the state i'm in at the moment. i'm on track five of an 

8 track album. i think i'll finish it and go to sleep. i couldn't

NOT finish this album. it's too good to be ended so quickly. i'm surprised

music is this appreciated on this drug. i'm wondering if i'm one of 

few that have used this drug for it's opaiate ability and not just for

back pain or if a lot of people use it for this. i love this drug.

i'll defiitely come out of this trip with more kowledge\ldots 

which is very good. i may or may not do these again. i have enough for 

two more trips equal dosage to the one i'm on now (200mg, four pills).

as a side note i will mention that i broke the pills in half before

i took them so the effects would come on quicker. just incase i forget

that small bit.



2:30 - smoking a cigarette. this girl is so cute. i wish she was here next to 

me right now. on track 6 going on track 7 now. i tidy up my room a bit

before laying down to go to sleep. flipped the light off in the begining

of the seventh track. my legs feel kind of numb. i like it. laying down

is gonna feel so good. mildly sweating. thinking about that girl that i

can carry on a conversation so well with.



2:36 - begining of the last track of the album. this is about it for the night!

i'm just gonna chill to this song. close my eyes and melt. the track is

mildly upbeat. this it for the night. i'll update in the morning.



2:38 - i turn off the computer and lay down for sleep. the trip has been long 

and good.





[next day]

12:07pm - i feel very worn down today. very lazy. these pills definitely come

with a hang over. nothing too bad. but i can tell it's there. my

morning has been bad because there's a kid that has been blowing up

my phone since 8am and he has not stopped calling. i guess he needs a

ride somewhere. but yeah, after a shower i'm hoping i won't feel so

worn down and tired today. i'm going to read over my report from last

night. 



12:19 - falling asleep last night, from what i can remember, was very easy. i

remember my body was twitching a lot. way way more than usual. the

twitching was definitely caused by the pills. i kinda remember having

minor CEVs before falling asleep which were kind of keeping me from

completely relaxing. i'm really tired still. bout to get in the shower.



12:25 - i hop in the shower.



12:43 - exiting shower. realizing that i came out of this trip with a lot more 

than i originally thought i came out of it with. i'm having the urge

to try something new! i want to impress someone or go to the beach or

something i don't normally do! i want to adventure somewhere that i've

never been. i have a feeling this trip has pushed me to try new things.

i don't know why or how exactly\ldots  but i like it. still feeling mild

effects. feeling refreshed after my shower. i feel motivated but tired.

it's all good. i may or may not expiriment with these pills again soon.



[EDIT!]

1:08pm - slight nausea led to projectile vomiting everything out of my stomach (just water). it was horrible but i feel better now. i hadnt eaten last night or this morning, so maybe now i'll eat something. i was not expecting that.



2:30 - first bit of food in 15 hours. slice of pizza. not much of an appetite but i know i need to eat. I'm basically forcing it down.
