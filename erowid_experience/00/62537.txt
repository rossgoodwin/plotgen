This is a warning, there are very few reports about snorting 2C-T-2, so I decided to write up my experience, and let me say that is what it was an experience. 2C-T-2 SHOULD NOT BE SNORTED! I have had experience with most of the more common psychedelics out there, and a couple of the more exotic rcs as well. and probably have almost 100 trips under my belt. For some reason I decided that 14mg would be a good dose for me and my friend, how wrong I was. 



As soon as I finished snorting a 7mg of 2C-T-2 into each of my nostrils, I knew I had fucked up. The burn was nowhere near as bad as 2C-E, but within 30 seconds I felt that something was wrong. Within a minute I was gagging. I needed to throw up. A minute or two later I did, it was everything in my stomach just a small bowl of veggie chili I ate an hour before. I grabbed a bowl to puke in, because I already knew I would have to puke again even though there was nothing left. I knew there was no way I would be standing in a minute or two.



5 Minutes later I started to really feel the effects of the T-2 come on. Everything around me began to shift and move. As the minutes passed though, everything got crazier and crazier. It is about ten to fifteen minutes into the trip when everything went to hell. My sense of time for the next two hours was almost non-existent. What follows is what I can best describe the experience as.



It was about fifteen minutes into the trip and I was laying in my friends huge easy chair. At this point I know that I fucked up. My friend who snorted the same amount of me was begining to freak out. He had puked his guts out and was having the same insane visuals I was having. His trip was also getting intense as mine. He however took the easy way out, he popped a 2mg xanax bar, and a cyclobenzadrine. This is probably what mellowed out what would become hell for me.



So fifteen minutes into my trip everything begins to become too intense. My friends voices became impossible to listen to. Everything from the outside world almost seemed to cause my brain to overload. It was almost as if huge forces of energy assaulted me whenever any activity happened in my brain. As I could not handle the visuals around me I shut my eyes. It is here where my real trip began. Later my sober friend would tell me I lay in that chair for two hours crying, for all could have cared that chair did not exist. When I closed my eyes I could still not stop what I can only describe as energy assaulting me. Any activity in my brain would trigger this. I tried as hard as I could to ignore sound feeling, all the senses. I decided that if I could just lay there not thinking or feeling that the energy, the intensity would go away.



It was as if the universe was smashing me with a hammer. Even my thoughts were too intense. As hard as I tried I could not clear my head. Eventually I could not control it any more. A thought I had began a chain reaction. I do not remember what that word was, but one word spawned a chain reaction. One thought would bring up another and that thought would bring up every thought associated with it. I was like an explosion in my mind expanding in all directions. Eventually I held every thought in the universe in my head at once.



When I closed my eyes I left what I now am sure is the 3rd world. This is the world we live in. This is the world we work, play, and love in. I entered the 2nd world, ourselves. The second world is the mind, myself who I am, my memories. It was at that point I held every thought in my head, that I entered the 1st world.



The 1st world is a strange one. I believe I have been there a few times, mostly on robo trips. But I reached it here. I left myself, I was no longer me, my family, my memories, those were not myself. I was still there, just not in that second world. I left my body. I was a line, energy, I had no perception, yet I knew all. There were other lines and energies that were constantly assaulting me throughout. I do not know how long I stayed in this 1st world, but gradually I began to return to the second, I became aware of my sitting, I became aware of the sounds around me.



By the time I left the other worlds and finally was able to open my eyes, everything had calmed down. As I looked up at the ceiling it still twisted and bended, but I no longer felt like I was being attacked by all the energy in the universe. My friend was also beginning to mellow out, and after another hour or two we pretty much returned to base line. So, in all the major part of the trip only lasted for about two or three hours after snorting. 



To best sum up the intensity of this trip I would say if dropping ten hits of acid is like drinking one beer, this trip would be drinking an entire twelve pack. Now as for 2C-T-2 in general, 2C-T-2 also seemed to have an almost errie body feel to it, never mind the fact it made me and a friend puke out our entire stomachs. 2C-T-2 is definately not a drug I would describe as friendly. The visuals are amazing. But this is definatley one I will not be trying again.
