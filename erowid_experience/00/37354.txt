One saturday night, me and my roomate decided to try brugmansia again. We had previously tried it, but only 1/2 a small flower each, and the effects were not too intense - we just felt a bit uncoordinated and heavy. This time, we decided to do it for real. We got 4 flowers (maybe 8-10 inches each) from a plant we knew of to share between the 2 of us. I was a veteran of psychedelics, so I didn't anticipate any real problems - I knew that i would never hallucinate enough to present a real danger to myself or others. So we began to make the tea\ldots  I put 4 flowers into about  1 liter of boiling water. After 5 minutes or so, i took out the flowers and put a bunch of sugar and lemon juice in the liquid to make it taste better. We poured out 2 mugs, and each drank 1. This was around 11:30pm. There was still about 350ml left in the pot, but we couldnt bring ourselves to finish the rest. 



10-15 minutes later, I started to feel pretty uncomfortable. Moving around presented a real problem, and my body felt really heavy. I was a bit nauseous, so I tried to limit my movement as much as possible. We popped in a dvd, but I hardly remember any of it. By this time, we were feeling pretty sleepy. My roomate just went to bed right away, and I went upstairs to my room. I tried to finish the movie upstairs, but kept falling asleep, so I went to play on my computer. That's one of the last things I remember.



That whole time, I didn't notice myself thinking any differently. I just felt uncoordinated, heavy, and dizzy. I do remember that I still had my contacts on and made a conscious decision to just go take a nap with them on. I'm still trying to figure out if I took a shower or not. I believe I just washed my face, brushed my teeth, put my phone on the charger, and went to bed. As far as I remember, I went to bed without consequence a little after 1am. The weirdness didn't manifest until I woke up. 



I woke up around 10:30am, really confused for a moment. I didn't know where I was, and I was on the other side of my bed. I almost never wake up on the other side of the bed. I decided to just lay there for a moment before I got up. The first really weird thing was that I heard the noise of running water. It sounded like it was coming from my bathroom (which was connected to my room), but I somehow convinced myself that it was just coming from my computer. Then, I heard a loud crash near my bed, which prompted me to get up and see what the matter was. I looked around my bed and didn't see anything that could have caused that crash. I walked over to the bathroom and found myself staring at a complete mess. I looked back at my room, and it was in complete disarray! The strange thing was that the mess wasn't just random and chaotic - it was like someone deliberately moved things around my room and put them in weird places to play a prank on me. I have 2 sinks in my bathroom, and the first thing I noticed was that one of the water faucets was running. I turned it off and took another look at the bathroom area. I was so sure that one of my roomates had played a prank on me while I was sleeping. Here's what I found:



2 shirt hangers from my closet, 1 on each water faucet. 

The shirts that were on these hangers were found around my room.

My hair wax container with the lid removed. I later found the lid under one corner of my bed.

My contact lens bottle, moved from the medicine cabinet to my desk in my room. The cap remained in the medicine cabinet.

My contact lens case. One side of the case was filled with hair wax, like someone used the case to scoop out hair wax. The caps to the case were on the bathroom counter. 

Even though I don't remember taking off my contacts, I found my contacts dried up - one in the sink, and one on the counter. What kind of mean prank is this???

A clorox clean-up spray bottle. The bottle was lying on its side on my counter, but the spray part was unscrewed and placed near my computer.

My swimming goggles, out of the case, on top of the spray bottle. They were in a plastic case, along with my nose clip, but I have yet to find those.

My glasses, on top of my shower sliding door. This area is quite narrow.

My toothbrush, on the other side of the counter that I never use, and my toothpaste lying near it.

My swim cap, moved from a towel rack in the bathroom, to the middle of the floor in my room.

My swimming trunks, moved from the shower door to my bed.

My laundry basket, moved from inside my walk-in-closet to near the bed, with my towel (that was in the bathroom) rolled up neatly inside, as well as a magazine inside.

Toilet paper rolls, about 2 of them, on my sink counter.

Paper towel roll, with the paper towels wrapped around just the middle of it, on my counter.

My shorts hanging off my guitar.

My room fan, turned off (I always leave it on)

A clean bowl in the middle of the carpet in my room.

Small tissue paper squares, found all over my room, in random places.

My back scratcher (which i had lost a couple days ago), lying neatly in front of my keyboard on my desk.



I then went to my computer to see if anyone pranked that as well. I found a bunch of random browser windows open, some random text in some windows (like `STOEH $>$IHCR') , and my away message on AIM was changed to my default `working' away message. A few really important directories were also deleted, and I had to get them out of the recycle bin.



By this time, I had cleaned up most of the mess, and was ready to go downstairs and ask my roomate about this great prank I thought he pulled. There were still 3 things I couldn't find in my room though. My toilet paper roll holder, my swimming nose clip, and my cell phone.



I went downstairs and asked my roomate if he messed up my room. He had no idea what I was talking about. He was sleeping the whole time, and only got up to go to the bathroom. I asked my other roomate, and she also had no idea what I was talking about. At this point I was really confused, and after much debate, we came to the conclusion that I had done it myself. I almost refused to believe it, as I had 0 recollection of doing any of these things. I tried to imagine myself doing those things, but it didn't trigger any memories or anything. I decided to stop thinking for a while and look for the missing things.



The first thing I found was my toilet paper roll holder. It was near the stairway, in a piece of rolled-up carpet that was lying on a tall box. This was extremely bizzare, because this was a very intentional placement of something, and in order to do this, one would have to lean over the stairway , and place it in the rolled-up carpet. Then I asked my roomates to call my phone. I finally found it. The phone was placed in the pocket of a pair of pants that I hadn't worn, and the pants were rolled up, and placed behind a bunch of garbage bags, in a storage cupboard near my bathroom. !!?!?! That made absolutely no sense to me.



As I thought more and more about it, I only vaguely remember 3 things that made me realize that I could have trashed my own room. I remember walking, and accidentally kicking the bowl that was in the middle of my room. This seemed normal to me at the time, for a bowl to be chilling in the middle of my room. The 2nd thing I vaguely remember was putting my glasses on top of the shower sliding door. These aren't very clear memories either\ldots  they seem more like 2 second scenes from a dream that I all but forgot about. The last thing I barely remember was my hair wax in my contact lens case, and ME TASTING/EATING THE WAX. I'm still not sure if I actually did that, but I have an extremely faint memory of doing so. 



Even though this was pretty funny after the fact, the scary thing about it all was that I had no recollection of doing these things. These things were not rational at all, and made absolutely no sense. Was I trying to play a prank on myself? Was I just doing these things because I thought each act had some sort of significance? Did I have a valid reason to do these things at the time? Did I do anything stupid, like eat hair wax; chug down clorox cleaning solution? I'm only relieved that I didn't do something worse, like cut off my penis or my tongue.



Based on the fact that I had absolutely no control over what I did, and that the things I did were totally irrational and not like myself, my official reccomendation is NOT to do brugmansia, even if you think you can control yourself on it. If you absolutely must try it, be sure you have a sober sitter that will be with you the entire time it takes for you to become sober. Other trip reports will confirm the bizarre nature of this drug. Be aware!
