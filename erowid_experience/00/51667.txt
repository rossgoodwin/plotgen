It started in June of 2002 when my girlfriend and I were using moderate amounts of cocaine, and one day my dealer was out of dope. Then I ran into an old buddy who said he could get some heroin. So I agreed. I went home and chopped up two small lines of white powder for both me and my girlfriend. The buzz was great even though it made us puke our guts out. 



As a couple of weeks go by of snorting dope every day, it was getting expensive because every time my girlfriend would snort a line, she would puke it up and lose her buzz. And of course, she would want another one. That's when that same old buddy told me that by using a needle, you get a way better high and you don't waste none. I tried it once and I was hooked! My girlfriend refused to inject any dope, so I told her that I wouldn't give her any more dope because she was wasting it by throwing up every time. So she finally agreed, but I had to shoot it in her arm for her because she was too scared to do it herself. After a couple of months of shooting heroin, I realized that I coldn't stop without getting deathly sick! I finally lost my job, and she wasn't working either, and no money coming in with a very expensive habbit to support. I pawned every thing I owned. Then I started pawning my mom's belongings, my girlfriends parent's belongings, stealing checks from my grandmother, stole money from my girlfriends parents cash card, and resources for money were running out! I didn't know what I was going to do if I didn't get some money for the next day. 



So on New Years Eve 2002, I was desperate because I knew that I had no way of getting any money the next day and I would be sick as hell! My girlfriends family was gone for the night, so I went into there house and took her dad's 22-caliber pistol that he had hidden in their basement. So with the pistol in my jacket pocket, I drove up to the local gas station and robbed the place at gunpoint. (I have already been charged and did my time for-this crime!) I came home with almost four hundered dollars so I was releived knowing that I had some cash to buy some heroin the next day. My girlfriend was flipping out! But we were good and high for two days until we ran out of money and dope again. So, thinking of how easy that was, I went and robbed that same store two nights later. 



But this time I only came out with less than a hundered bucks! Enough to last only through that night and into the morning. So, the next afternoon, I went and robbed a different gas station coming out with over six hundered dollars. I went straight to my dealer and bought five hundered dollars worth of dope! (13 or 14 bags) That night I seen myself on the news for these robberies. I was flippin' out, I didn't know what to do. Four o'clock in the morning the police raided my girlfriends parents house where I was staying,and took me into custody. I knew I was going to be sick as hell in jail. There was nothing I could do but sit and be sick. My bail was \$100,000 and I had no way to come up with that kind of money. In May 2003, I was sentenced to 48 months in prison. With `good time', I only had to do 32 months. 



I was finally released in September of 2005. My girlfriend hooked up with someone else and had a kid, so I went back to my family who had forgave me for everything I did in the past. About a month after I was out, I tried heroin again. I was hooked again instantly. A few months into that, I tried kickin by myself and couldn't do it. So I went and got on to the methadone program. Now to this day, I drink my 110mg.'s every day to stay well. I tried using, but it don't do anything but buzz me for about 2 minutes and then it's gone, so I figured that it isn't even worth it. So now I'm working again full time and trying to get my shit straight again. I was turned on to a crack habbit by that same old buddy. So now I'm trying to control that. I ask myself why didn't I learn my lesson, wasn't prison enough?
