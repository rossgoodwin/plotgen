I will start with the fact that I cannot fully recall most of the details during this trip, but I will do my best to describe generally what I was feeling and seeing at the time.



Being only my second time doing shrooms, I decided I needed a chill place to trip, and a good friend to trip with.  J, a friend from school, was more than happy to supply the goods as well as be my fellow tripper buddy, or whatever.  We decided that an eigth each would suffice for an incredible trip, but dealing with this amount we realized we would have to be in a very controlled setting or else things could go horribly wrong.  Which they did.



On a sunny friday evening, we decided to go to J's house to trip.  His porch was a really nice setting for the trip; he had comfortable chairs, a river in the distance, and a huge woodsy yard to hang around in.  



T-0:00 At around 6:00, we both started with half of our doses, about 1.75 g each.  This was the first time I had actually eaten the shrooms straight(before I had eaten them in chocolate), and it was a suprisingly easy and quick job.  After downing the shrooms, we each grabbed a glass of water and sat down on J's comfortable porch seats.  J lit up a cigarette, and we just relaxed and let the shrooms hit us.



T-0:30 After about a half an hour, I already started feeling some fuzzy sensation throughout my body, and mild hallucinations that could be paralleled to a marijuana buzz.  J and I began to philosiphize, because honestly it's what we do best.  We talked for close to an hour about life in general.  I claimed that there was no universal truth, perception is all we have, and each persons perception is different.  We went deeper and deeper into the philosophy as well as in the trip.



T-1:00 At this point I was really starting to feel a change.  I looked up at the trees blowing softly in the wind, noticing the intricacy of every leaf moving in its own way, almost resembling a green sea filled with life and a mind of their own.  I then noticed the fence of the porch directly in front of me.  I began to see a strange aura around each individual piece of wood, with a slight amount of bending and breathing going on at the same time.  I looked over at J, and could tell he was deep into the trip as well.  



T-1:15 At this point we decided to go inside for a while since it was getting dark, and J recommended that we listen to some music, preferably Pink Floyd.  When the music started, J and I immediately felt at one with the music and began dancing.  The trip was going absolutely fantastic; the music was flowing through me, and I could pick out each instrument and hear every note that it was playing.  As I danced with what seemed like an unlimited source of energy, I looked at the carpet and noticed that it was waving and rippling almost like water.  



T-1:45 My friend J's brother M(who also happened to be my friend)got home from somewhere at this point in time.  He wasn't going to be tripping for the night, but he did have a good amount of weed, so we decided to puff a little.  M had a couple friends over, and we all cheefed on the bowl for about a half an hour.  The trip was going hard, and I was feeling oh sooo good.  I then realized that we had only taken half of our doses, and told J it was probably time to finish it up.  All I could think at this point was, `Man I'm reallly tripping!  Imagine the possibilities if I take even more!  So I did, and J did.



T-2:15 after about a half an hour of hangin out with people, I started getting a funny feeling in the pit of my stomach.  This was the turning point in the trip, where things went from great to reallly bad.  I had an amazing amount of self awareness at this point, I could almost see myself in the third person perspective.  This awareness lead to being way too self concious, however.  I started feeling my tongue inside my mouth and throat to an intense degree.  I would have certain instances where I felt like I was feeling my mouth from outside of my body, a very weird sensation.  I started to almost feel like if I wasn't careful, I would swallow my tongue.  I tried to keep cool, but I was really beginning to get freaked out.



T-2:30  I figured some water might do me some good at this point, but when attempting to drink it, I had absolutely no coordination, and could barely swallow.  I gave up with the water, and went to the bathroom to wash my face.  In the bathroom, I looked into the mirror, and what I saw freaked me out.  I simply could not recognize what I was seeing in the mirror.  I looked like some demon or crazy person or something, my eyes looked freaky, and my mouth looked really squiggly and distorted.  I went back upstairs to be with everyone, and told J I was starting to get anxious.  He calmed me down momentarily, but as I sat down and watched the kids around me interact, I felt like when I focused on a single person that I was that person.  Questioning ones own identity is an odd experience indeed. I started wondering if I was really my brother, my friend, and so on.



Although it was still relatively early, I told J I was kind of freaking out and that I was going to bed.  He said that it was cool and that I could sleep on the couch downstairs.  As I headed downstairs, I started to feel a deep confusion coming on.  When I reached to pick up a blanket, it morphed into the shape of an alien, so I closed my eyes, yanked the blanket as fast as I could and jumped on the couch.  After being still on the couch for about 20 seconds, I began to feel that I was melting through the couch.  I could not get comfortable, so I sat up.  That is when the sounds began.



They started as high pitched sounds, just random squeeks and hums, kind of rotating around the room.  As I got more scared from these sounds, I felt the world around me getting darker and darker.  As the room got darker, my face felt like it was stretching, and at the same time the noises I was hearing got lower pitched and louder.  Then the low pitched noise almost turned into a loud BOOMing sound.  I was so freaked out that I sprinted upstairs to see what Jon was doing.



He was on the computer and I started babbling about the fucked up things that were going on.  He calmed me down a bit, but I was ancy as hell, and nothing could stop that.  The last stage of the trip that really scared me the most began at that point.  Jon looked over at me and told me to `Get that crazy smirk of your face, man!'  I didn't even realize that I was smiling, and attempted to adjust it.  My face began responding ridiculously.  It started twitching uncontrollably, which freaked the hell out of me.  Jon realized that I needed some help, so he gave me some prozac, which he claimed would lessen the trip.



T-4:00 I felt a lot better at this point.  I was still tripping hard, and everything started to look really digital and pixelated, but I was getting more relaxed.  Me, J and M decided to watch The Big Lebowski, a hilarious movie.  Unfortunately for me, I had no idea what the hell was going on in the movie.  Everything that the characters said sounded like backwards jibberish, and their facial expressions looked like cartoons.  At one point I actually saw my own face on one `the Dude's' face, which I found amusing at this point.  From this point on, everything was getting a lot more enjoyable again, but I was also getting really tired, probably from the prozac considering shroom trips usually last longer than 4 hours.



To sum it up, this experience mostly sucked.  That night I almost called my parents, the police, and even worried that I would do something crazy like run around the neighborhood naked.  I had no control over anything.  But in all it was at least mind-blowing, which can be a good thing to remember in the future.  I tried shrooms once more after this instance, and had the most pleasurable experience ever.



Peace!
