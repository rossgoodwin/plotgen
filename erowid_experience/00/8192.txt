My good friend X used to tweak a lot.  She loves crystal, but for her it is special enough that she only does it occasionally now when she feels it is well deserved.  Me and her were going to a two day music festival on the weekend, so she purchased a \$60 bag of the white powder for herself with the promise that I could try some.  



She picked me up early Saturday morning.  She had already shot up at her house.  I was scared about what I knew I would be doing that day, but curious and excited at the same time.  But I didn't have much time to organize my thoughts.  Five minutes later she handed me a pen top with the crystal lined up on the flat part--one bump.  I became extremely scared at the prospect of what I was about to do.  I nearly wimpered when I asked her how the hell I was supposed to snort this hard, dry, grainy white powder.  But I was brave and I snorted it.  Seeing as how I was not dead, my fear vanished and was replaced by excited anticipation, and ten minutes later, I bumped again.



I started to feel the drip about ten minutes later.  It was nasty, very foul, and harsh.  But I welcomed it because I knew it meant the drug would be taking effect.  However, because it was my first time tweaking and I did not pay for the drug, I only bumped once more that day about six hours later in the afternoon.  So I actually did not do very much crystal, and the effects were pretty much negligible.  But the experience was unique, and I would like to focuss on the few effects that I did notice despite the low dose.  It should be noted that throughout the day I smoked a couple of joints and several bowls, probably amounting to at least a dime-sized bag of weed by the end of the day.



First off, about an hour after the second bump, I started to feel sick and I had to take a shit.  I felt better afterwards though.  As we walked towards the place where the festival was being held, I kept seeing a black dot in the far right field of my vision.  But when I would turn my head, nothing would be there.  I kept wanting to feel the wonderful effects that X had told me about--the incessant talking, the euphoria, the desire to work, etc.  But I hadn't taken enough of the drug.  I kept saying `I don't feel anything' and X would tell me that was because I wasn't doing anything.  We were just sitting listening to the music, chillin with other people, smokin joints.  But if I thought about it, I could slightly feel the threshold effects of the crystal.  There are two instances that especially stand out in my mind.



1) We were high in the stands of the stadium.  As I looked down at the thousands of people in the field, I started to play a little game with my eyes.  The colors already seemed more intense than usual.  I would say in my mind `I want to see red' and all the people wearing red shirts in that crowd of thousands would suddenly stand out.  `I want to see blue' and my eyes would only focus on those who were wearing blue shirts.  It was strange but entertaining.  I must have played that game for at least 15 minutes.



2) My friend X had brought some ecstacy pills to try to get rid of.  She had a ballpoint pen and a small notebook and was making little signs to hold up to try to advertise that she had pills.  I asked if I could help--for some reason I really wanted to make one of those signs.  X had shown me her notebooks that she had filled when she was tweaking.  They were full of dark black spotches where she had crossed things out by totally blackening them in.  She said that's what she does when she is tweaking.  Well that's what I did.  I drew the outline of a lowercase `e' and I started coloring it in as if that was my sole purpose in life.  It was strangely satisfying.  I must have blackened in that e for at least half an hour, maybe even an hour.  I colored so hard that the paper curled and tore.  She didn't even use my little sign.  But I didn't care--I had so much fun making it.  I felt so accomplished and useful.



In conclusion, I would say that at least for myself, three bumps is not enough to fully feel the effects of crystal.  But I think it was sufficient for my first time tweaking since I was so scared.  Now that my fear is gone, I feel I can later have a stronger experience.  Mild intoxication was pleasant, but I am excited to discover what all the fuss about crystal is all about.  But please, everyone be careful.  Crystal addiction is hard to kick--I've heard the stories firsthand.
