May 27, 2005 -- May 28, 2005



Names have been changed.



After school on May 27, 2005, Doug and Neo picked up the mushrooms we have been desperately waiting for the past week or so. Our dealer Zak got us a 1/8th for 35 dollars, they where 10 bucks more because they are kinda rare and they were some really good mushrooms. Once we got them, Doug had 20 dollars he was going to spend on weed but couldn't get any, so he decided to get some Heroin instead. After getting them, Doug got the Heroin around 4:30. Neo was coming over to spend to night and have a very memorable time. We had planned to do mushrooms that night.



8:30pm - Neo stopped by Doug's house and the fun started to begin. We decided that we should eat the mushrooms on an empty stomach so it will effect us more. Time passed and we had nothing to do, we had to wait till Doug's mom decided to go to bed. In the mean time Neo and Doug began to watch `Pulp Fiction'' to get us in the mood. While watching, we had great urges to do some Heroin because in the movie `Vence Vega' does heroin. We where going to do the Heroin on tin foil. Doug's mom was home so we had to wait until she went to bed. 



10:00pm - Once she was in bed, Doug and Neo began slamming. We decided to do it in Doug's bathroom first but once we figured out it didn't smell much, we started to do it in Doug's room. Neo did about 10 hits, and Doug did about 12 hits. 



11:00pm - We sat and watched `Pulp Fiction' for awhile. It felt as if we where sitting on a cloud. Everything was so wondering and our bodies felt like constant orgasms. Cracking my back on Heroin feels like an Orgasm. We rabbled about some things for about 20 mins and just sat and enjoyed the moment. We wanted to wait until Doug's mom was completely asleep before we ate the mushrooms.



11:46pm - We ate the mushrooms. We put them on 2 slices of pizza, one for Doug and one for Neo. We both took about half a 1/8th. By the way, they where some really powerful mushrooms. We probably were only supposed to take a like a cap or a stem but we ingested all of it. After eating them, we decided to wait a little before we did anything else.



12:00am - We were going to leave Doug's house around 1:00am but until then we didn't have much to do. Neo made the last of the heroin on some tin foil. We sat on Doug's bed talking about how we felt from all the Heroin we did before. We were not making much sense. About 20 mins after eating them Neo began his trip. He was talking different from before and started to act more random as timed passed. Doug wasn't feeling much while Neo just started to come up. Neo had the great idea to have a bowl or too of cannabis, apparently it will affect you more if smoke while on mushrooms. 



Neo and Doug took turns going outside to have a bowl or two, we thought it was safest in case Doug's mom walked in. Neo came in talked about when he was outside, he keep stepping in water even though there was no water on the ground. Neo also said how peaceful it was while he was smoking. Once he came back inside, Doug stepped out and had a bowl. When Doug was smoking, a shadow came up that looked like a person and put out his hand as if he would like a hit. Doug, thinking nothing of it, gave the bowl to the shadow figure and then realized that the shadow figure wasn't real. Doug went back inside and Neo and Doug started to talk about what just happened.



The heroin made us very happy while the mushroom enhanced the feeling about 20 times. We began laughing hysterically at nothing and started to type out how we felt. The feelings we were having were like nothing we have had before. It was like confusion, Euphoria, happiness combined, pretty much like exploring new places you have never been before in your brain. A good example was when Doug and Neo were sitting on the bed and Doug said to Neo ``We should listen to more music'' in return Neo said ``Yes, we should smoke more heroin.'' Pretty much we were not making any sense.



1:00am - We left Doug's house and headed toward the Avocado Orchard that was just up Doug's street. Getting out the house without making much noise was a difficult task since we couldn't tell what was loud and what wasn't. Once out of my house, we headed toward the Orchard. First thing we noticed was that we were not walking right. It seemed as though our feet had a mind of there own. It was if our feet were not there and our head's were just floating up the street. Doug said that it seemed as though everything was spinning. The tree's branches were moving in a circular motion and he felt at peace with everything.



Neo said that he couldn't feel the rest of his body and all he thought he had was his head. While we were walking it seemed the street wouldn't end, it just keep on going forever. Once we reached the Orchard, Neo had the smart idea of calling nicole (One of our friends). Once Doug asked him what he was doing, he said he didn't know and just hung up the phone. We have smoked in the orchard before and have a spot we normally go to. We walked pass the spot we normally go to and just keep walking, we soon realized that we were walking to no where and went back and sat down were we normally go.



1:15am - Once we were comfortable, Neo whipped out his piece and the weed. We started to smoke but after about the 3rd bowl, we started to hit our peak, and when I say peak, I mean the mushroom peak, the heroin peak and we were stoned. We started to pass bowls with nothing in it because we forgot that there was nothing in it. When we smoked, it seemed as though you couldn't feel it in your lungs, we could see the smoke come out but could not feel it. We keep getting side tracked and forgot what we were doing. We started to talk about our life, past, present and pretty much everything. We weren't really having conversations, more like talking out loud but not comprehending what the each other are saying.



We got side tracked so much that Doug would have to remind Neo what we are doing; he would point at the pipe and exclaim ``Smoke.'' The feeling was the most euphoric feeling. It felt as if out bodies was having constant orgasms we soon realized that smoking was pointless because we could not get any more messed up. Our brains were in complete bliss. We sat and tried to grasp what was going on. Doug thought there was someone running around in the orchard. We started to laugh uncontrollably for about 30 mins. It was the best moment in out lives, the climax of our lives. We decided to head back to Doug's house.



Around 2:30 or 3:00am - Neo and Doug stood up, immediately after standing up, Doug fell down. We slowly made out way from our spot to the street. One look at us and you could tell we were fucked up. We were staggering as if we were really drunk; it was if we had no balance. All we could do is put one foot in front of another and hope we don't fall over. We were talking; well it was more like shouting because we couldn't control the volume of our voices. We finally reached my house, normally would take about a minute, it took us about 10 mins. We made it to Doug's room and once in the room we started to watch TV. Neo pointed out that it seemed as though everything on TV had to do with sex. TV seemed extreamly interesting. We sat on the bed and talked for awhile even thought it made no sense. 



4:30am - Usually when I am tired I feel heavy, if I take that and multiple it by 100, that was how it felt. We began to come down from everything and all you could feel was heaviness and totally out of it. Doug turned off the TV and both Doug and Neo passed out.



We woke up the next day in a mood of complete happiness and appreciation to the world and its beauty. Also feeling of extreme tiredness. It was like hang over but without the shitty feeling, just the feeling of being very tired and out of it.



I would like to say that there are a lot of black moments we don't remember about that night. Pretty much that night was the climax of our life, a feeling that can't really be described in words. It will was absolutely fantastic. I would also like to say that mushrooms and heroin is great combination. All I really have to say is that, That was a night to remember.
