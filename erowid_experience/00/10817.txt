Having nothing to do this weekend, my girlfriend and I went to the local store and I decided to obtain a bottle of 18 extra strength No-Doz. At about 10:30 I swallowed six pills (200 mg apiece) along with a cup of Faygo Moon Mist (a caffinated soda much like Mountain Dew, but with more sugar). The effects began almost instantly. About five minutes later, I felt a strange warmth in my stomach, like the first feeling after dropping E. A half hour later, I had a pleasant, speed-ish buzz going on. Trails were faint but present for the first hour or so. I was also VERY giggly, I remember laughing a whole lot about not much. I had a nice, tingly body buzz as well. 



After a couple hours of this, I decided to try crushing up a pill and snorting a couple bumps. The effects were minimal, at best. However, it left an awful pill taste in the back of my throat, so I quickly abandoned it. 



About 15 minutes later, (approx 2:30 or so) everything started to go all wrong. I had a wrenching pain in my stomach and my heartbeat became very loud. It seemed like every sound I heard was magnified, and my breathing became very deep. I kept drinking water, hoping to flush my system, and I also took regular dumps to help speed my sobriety. At about 3:30 or so I decided to start trying to sleep it off, so I took short, half-hour to 15 minute naps that usually ended in me sitting bolt upright and looking at the clock for no apparent reason.



At about 4:30/5:00 I started to believe that my life was going into the gutter. All these dreadful realizations began to dawn on me (I'm living with my girlfriend and my parents don't know, I haven't got my grades yet, etc, etc, ad infinitum). Anyone who's had a panic attack will know the sensation I felt. After about an hour and a half of lying in bed and freaking out about my life, I decided in a panicked state to go try to find my grades online. I literally ran out of my house at about 6:15 am and walked very swiftly to the computer lab. 



Finding it locked, I decided to enter the building through a garage door which I found open. Since I had worked in this building over the summer I knew many ways in, but i still became quite frantic at the thought of being caught inside. I went to the computer lab, tried to look up my grades, and then when that failed, sat in front of the computer blankly for about 15 minutes until I got up the courage to leave. On the way out, I literally made a mad dash for the door in blind terror at being `caught' (even though this was completely irrational; I've been in this same building at even weirder hours without any complaints from campus security.) I didn't shake this feeling until after I was almost back home.



After freaking out about various other things for a couple hours, I started to realize that my panicked state was irrational and decided to try to sleep it off again. Again, the best I was able to do were short half-hour naps, but I found that drinking milk helped to coat my stomach so I didn't feel like I was about to puke at any second. Eating some soup also made me feel much better. I finally fell soundly asleep at noon or so, and when I woke up at 2, I felt much better. My stomach still has a dull ache, but that's subsiding quickly.



I don't recommend this experience to anybody. Even though the early effects were pleasant, none were worth the self-loathing and paranoia that I experienced. Also, by comparing my experience, it seems that individuals have very widely varying tolerances to caffiene pills. It's not worth risking your health to figure out what yours is. I got lucky in that I didn't have to make a trip to the hospital to get my stomach pumped. Needless to say, I won't be repeating this experience again.
