I was on senior trip and had previously bought six packets of morning glories because I wanted to do them twice on the vacation. I took 3 packets in the morning at about 12. I ground them up in our neighbors blender and drank them with red kool aid. Even though they don't have much taste even the smell of the seeds make me gag but I forced them down. I had done morning glories before and have had multiple horrifying experiences (including breaking my ankle). Needless to say I was determined to get it right and have a positive experience with morning glories. 



I didn't feel anything at first. I went to the beach and got sick. I knew I was about to throw up so I hurried to the bathrooms luckily nobody was in there but I didn't make it to the toilet and projectile vomited red puke all over the walls in the bathroom. It looked like a murder scene and I felt bad for whoever had to clean it up.



I got back to the room at about 3 o'clock (there were about 12 friends renting out a house with me that week). I started to feel weird. I cannot really explain it but it's how I usually feel when I do morning glories or acid. I knew I was about to start feeling the effects of the morning glories.



I started to get suspicious of everybody and didn't trust anybody. To make matters worse some sketchy guys came to our room trying to sell us club passes for the week to all these parties and gave us 2 free cases of rockstar energy drinks. This sent me into a spiral of paranoia and I was like screw this and decided to try to go to bed at 3 o'clock in the afternoon for some reason. I actually did fall asleep for about 40 minutes.



When I woke up I was completely and utterly wrecked. I was a complete mess and not functional at all. Everybody from my house had left and went to the neighbors leaving me alone in this horrible state of mind. I did not want to be in this state of mind at all. I felt like completely destroying my head and smashing it open and snapping my fingers back and breaking them (literally). I wanted to destroy myself for some reason. I also felt like I could change the way I looked and my bone formations by just thinking about it. This seemed like it was going to be a typical morning glory experience for me: a disaster. I remember just wishing I was sober and wanting it to be over.



I tried laying back in bed and just sleeping it off which is impossible. I put the covers over my head and the covers were crashing over my face like ocean waves. I then decided to get back up and get something to eat and as I walked to the kitchen I felt completely weightless and I kept thinking about how easily I could get a knife and just start hacking at myself and I would be a part of one of those crazy horror drug stories you hear about all the time. I never actually got anything to eat I just looked at the fridge and went to the bathroom and looked at myself in mirror and I was surprised at what I looked like. I had completely forgot what I looked like before.



I decided to go out on the balcony and smoke a cigarette this was at about 7 o'clock. This was the complete turning point of the trip. Before the cigarette I was having a horrible time and wanted nothing more for it to be over. The combination of the cigarette, the nice night, the fun party environment I was in, and the realization that I was completely safe and there was absolutely nothing to get paranoid about since the entire beach was on drugs and the cops didn't seem to care and I by no means at all took enough to end up in the hospital.



I started to feel euphoric and happy and I was extremely glad I was tripping and glad that I was finally having a good time. I was in the perfect state of mind I like to do drugs and be completely wrecked but not feel like crap. I just sat out on the lobby and was tripping hard and I was happy to be there. I smoked another cigarette and enjoyed the noise of everybody screaming and yelling from all of the other houses and the great party environment.



Whenever I went back inside I heard my friends coming back home to party at our house for the night and I was really scared to interact with people so I jumped in bed and acted like I was asleep. While I was laying in bed pretending to sleep I felt like my mind was stretching. That is the best way to describe it. I felt like I was getting great exercise for my mind and I was using parts of my brain that I never normally use. I felt like after the trip I was going to be smarter because of this. It felt awesome it was one of the best feelings I have ever felt. After awhile I decided to get up and interact with everybody. Everyone was drinking and playing beer pong and I avoided the alcohol and just sat around and hung out.



I then decided to smoke some pot that I brought along and this made things really weird. I smoked it and laid down on the linoleum floors that was covered in sand and dirt and stared at the ceiling shoot up a mile from my face and come down inches to my face and I felt like I was in another realm. I laid there and stared at the ceiling until I feel asleep. Whenever I woke up I was still very messed up. But I was on senior trip so I smoked more pot and drank more alcohol and went about my day. 



In hindsight I was very glad that I finally had a good experience. I never actually became smarter from the brain stretching that I talked about earlier but it felt really amazing at the time. My thoughts on Morning Glories are its hit and miss. I could have a great time but easily it could turn on me and I could have a very bad experience.
