I heard about the seed's psychotropic effects from a friend and decided to read up.



I tried once with poorly grounded seeds and threw them up and had no effects whatsoever.



The second try I was more determined and I ground them up more thoroughly and put 4 tablespoons in some applesauce which tasted horrible.



Almost immediately, I felt sick to my stomach. I tried to keep it down. My girls and I went to a sauna in a beautiful apartment complex with koi fish, and a jacuzzi. I enjoyed the place, but felt sick for 30 minutes before I threw it up. 



I was enraged, and I threw the rest of the seed in the thrash and told my friends it was stupid and that I did not want them to feel like I did, because they were planning to take it if I felt good.



I was irritated and upset, why didn't it work for me??? I continued to stay warm in the jacuzzi. We left to my friends house and smoked a few bowls of weed.



After being stoned and watching everyone talk, I noticed that I seemed to be very entertained by how quickly my friend Cheylea was talking. I was very consumed in her conversation, and wondered why I was staying so quiet instead of engaging in conversation.



I soon realized that I was seeing patterns move slowly and the blanket on Dario's bed was moving like the sea. I explained to my friends that (3 hours later) I was feeling the effects!



But I felt extremely uncomfortable explaining myself, and started to become overwhelmingly self conscious. I felt like my friends were not interested in what I was feeling and I was afraid that I was the only one feeling this way. I had been in a a silly argument with my boyfriend that morning and almost completely lost the meaning of why I was upset. I wanted to go to the store to buy something to eat and see him. 



When coming down the hill to my boyfriend's work, I had an overwhelming epiphany in my own voice telling me to tell the truth. The speed of the thoughts were growing increasingly and winding into different thoughts.



While in the grocery aisle, I suddenly found it impossible to make a decision. And lost interest in food very quickly when my dear friend Kimberly plucked a piece of bread in my hand and told me it might be interesting to taste on the psychedelic drug.



Her words appealed to me, so I put it in my mouth, with immediately absorbed all the saliva in my mouth and became and inedible gum. I was confused and uncomfortable so I bought a soda.



My boyfriend got off work and I explained to him that I was no longer angry and I was under the influence. I explained to Cheylea and my boyfriend Adrian that if I did not talk to them, I might `float away'. I felt that if I was alone I might seriously lose my mind and end up in a mental hospital. My thoughts seemed intelligent but when I spoke I became frustrated.



At first I went back to my friends house, still feeling extremely uncomfortable around everyone and wanted to change.



I went to my house, COMPLETELY AVOIDED MY MOM. I knew I could not speak to her normally. I quickly smothered myself with blankets and felt safe. I demanded that my boyfriend hold me closely. I felt safe.



He suggested we go out to eat, I hadn't eaten all day and the idea of pasta made me smile. More importantly, the idea of him taking me to eat pasta seemed overwhelmingly sweet. Although I was scared to leave my position. I went out to eat with him at Pat and Oscars at the mall. My visuals were intense.



When I inhaled the lights became increasingly brighter. When I drank soda the lights got brighter. When I sighed or whined the lights became darker. We went home and my thoughts were running into an infinite trail.



I tripped out on the fact that I felt so uncomfortable around my friends earlier that night. I felt so insecure and I could not explain. 



I later got into a seriously intense conversation about bad things that happened to me when I was younger. I felt insecure about the way I knew it affected me today. I was angry about how I could not get over it. I was angry because I grew up without a father. I was angry because my mom never made me feel safe. She took drugs and was angry all the time. The feelings overtook me. I cried intensely. My boyfriend held me, he told me I might need to talk to someone and fix things with my mom. I told him I wasn't comfortable with talking to anyone but him about it. He said he didn't know what to say to make me feel better.



But during the conversation, the words came to him. My anger soon felt subsided. I felt so comfortable in knowing that he was willing to stay up late and talk to me about it all. He was giving me attention and love. I felt safe and had a euphoric feeling overcome me. I looked at him for a while as he started to fall asleep. I felt like crying. I told him I loved him. I smiled and felt euphoria.



I looked at the posters in his room swirling and shifting for a while and slowly fell into a dreamy sleep.
