One night I got an urge, the urge to trip hard on some DPT. All of my previous experiments with DPT had gone quite well, except for the problem of having no `good' way take it. Snorting more then 50mg completely fucks my nose for days afterward, can't smoke it cause it's the HCL and I couldn't do a freebasing because I only had 100mg left. Orally is a waste, unless you've got some rue seeds, which I recently obtained for this purpose and oral DPT-hausca would have been the way to go except for one little problem\ldots  I wanted to go to sleep in about five hours and I'd had a medium sized meal about an hour ago. That method would had taken 10 hours wear off enough for me to sleep. Now the point of explaining all this is to show that I didn't have a choice, I had to do the unthinkable\ldots  



11pm - I crushed up and swallowed a teaspoon of rue seeds and then began to setup my tripping area (music, blankets, my two gorgeous dogs). I go to the toilet to try and to shit.



11:45pm - I put about 20ml of water into a shot glass and stir in 100mg of DPT, about 50\% dissolves. I sucked the DPT-water up with a plastic measuring syringe, laid down on the bed and then squirted up me bum. I laid there for a couple of minutes so it could soak in, thinking to myself `what the fuck are you doing? Stuffing research chemicals up your arse, your fucking crazy' it's not a nice memory but it's not that bad really. The logical part of my brain knows that docs have been doing this for decades and it's actually a very effective method.



12pm - I sit in my comfortable seat and await the effects.



12:05pm - Nothing yet so I have a cone and by the time I've finished it (30 seconds) I am tripping madly. I am overwhelmed as in five minutes I have reached the peak which is ridiculously intense, I mean FUCK!  Waves of orgasmic pleasure surge through my body intermittently while I was coming up but during the peak I didn't even know I had a body. I was in a hyperspace trance for something like 45minutes, so many visions, so breath-taking, so unlike any other psychedelic I've tried, so 3 dimensional and immersive, an unbelievable amount of content\ldots  fucking absolutely amazing. 



Of the many visions I can remember, there were 1000's I can't; I was confronted with giant walls all around me, all moving in as if to crush me. There was the most detailed texture you'll ever see on the walls, it was millions of images of my own head, all their lips moved very quick but I couldn't hear them. I realised that this was my ego trying to contain my spirit inside my body and that I needed to embrace the wall without fear and brake through it - it was the only way, it was a test. I throw my arms out wide and opened my soul to the wall. The wall flattered out to a huge single 2D plain, I began to move my arms in, slowly removing the skin between me and infinity as I do so. The walls are removed and I can see an infinity of the move beautiful colors I've ever seen.



I became a female spirit and drifted to a dark room where my body was tried up in a chair and it's head was in a mad fit (sorta like in Jacobs ladder). I comforted my struggling psyche `It's ok, everything's ok, don't worry so much'. At no time was it scary, I wasn't feeling my pain, I was confident I was correcting it. Later I also received the ultimate book of wisdom from the hand of god and became one with millions of people and god and the book and everything at the same time. I can't imagine a more spiritually toned or intense experience (but there not probably is, I just can't imagine it).



1pm - I am slowly descending from the peak now and can function in the physical world. I walk out to the front of my house and look at the street lights, WOW! The aura from the lights almost completely obstructs my vision like super thick fog. I can here a high-speed police chase a couple of streets away, I seem to be able to tell EXACTLY where all the cars are even though that's more then a mile away, it's so quiet except for those cars, I decide that is why and go inside because it's pretty cold out there. Over 2 hours I wonder around the house looking at everything turn into snakes or jaguars or other exotic animals that may or may not exist something.



I guess that's the hamala influence but maybe it's just because I was exacting a ayahausca-style experience and it was, minus the bodyload you hear about from ayahausca but then again. I haven't tried ayahausca yet and therefore can't properly compare it to this experience.



4:30pm - I'm only tripping lightly now and end up falling asleep without any chemical assistance after only a few minutes laying in bed.



It was difficult for me to deal with the method of administering the dose but in the end I'm very glad I did it that way. The only bodyload was an all body orgasm, the trip was ridiculously intense, no nose burn or nasty drip and I was able to sleep only 5 hours after dosing. Great stuff that DPT but be ready, it took a lot of mental effort and strength to go with the flow and not freak out\ldots  approach with caution but I would encourage other adventures to try this combo. It's incredible.
