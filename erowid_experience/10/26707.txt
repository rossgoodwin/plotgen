I have ingested every psychoactive chemical known to man and probably a few that haven't--been to several rehabs -done some jail time and all for the pursuit of that elusive `spiritual experience'--that I ,somehow , felt would rocket me into that dimension or place or room that I have visited twice in my life --once under 15-20 drops of liquid LSD (which I ended up being hospitilized for)and then again with the following account of spiritual consciousness.

Needless to say, I have extensive psychedelic experience--I never thought I would be posting a story here--but felt this one time--wouldn't hurt. With that said --please excuse the ADD style of writing here\ldots and,of course,I neither confirm or deny that these events occurred.

Recently with the novelty of research chemicals -I have had the pleasure of a few rather interesting journey's but none yet can compare with the onset and sheer intensity of this route and specific chemical 2ct2 for visual experience, in my frame of reference---I spent several months in amsterdam trying every mushroom and cactus in the `smart shops' on a relapse and when I returned to the states found it difficult to find similar psycoactives that I felt were safe---I can only use ganja or psycedelics because of a baffling and very public alcohol and cocaine addiction ----so\ldots in search of that elusive spiritual experience \ldots and after much research and reading `DMT-- the spirit molecule' --I decided to get back to my search for the elusive `experience' -I purchased some 5-MEO-DMT--2ct7 and 2ct2 --because I suspected that these chemicals would be banned soon--My experience with the smoked DMT was simply sheer unadulterated terror and was too short to make any revelations that I could get my arms around,so to speak----2ct7 was amazing visually but lasted too long and despite the analog connection was NOT like mescaline--the 2ct2 orally was similar to mescaline visually--and ,for me, the spiritual component was perceived--and the fact that the duration was short was a bonus-I enjoyed the substance extensively (every day) via insufflation and oral routes while enjoying the pool this summer behind my house ,playing guitar and walking in the woods --I saved one dose for a special day or occasion because I knew it was time to get sober again--and flushed the rest of my chemicals because I suspected something bad might happen (I purchased too much and it was time)

 To put this story somewhat in a context of why I felt I wanted to `research' these substances is because I have had up to 12 years of sobriety at a stretch-and whenever I relapse bad things eventually WILL happen-Over the last 7 years I have been struggling with sobriety--usually opting for the marijuana maintenace program--instead of daily AA meetings for sanity in this current chaotic world--but eventually would always go back to alcohol and would always get in trouble with the law -I was still hoping for a spiritual experience like Bill Wilson (co-founder of AA) had on the `belladonna treatment' with the white light phenomenon ---maybe that could set me back on the path of recovery because both of my last 2 long term sobriety periods were precluded by a heavy mushroom or LSD dosing ---and after reading about the recovery movement I stumbled onto the fact that the co-founder of AA also had researched LSD in the 50's and felt it had much promise for alcoholics to reach that consciousness necessary for recovery from alcohol or drug dependence--hence the fascination with psycedelics.

 Knowing that this would be my final attempt with this substance-2ct2-I decided to use the same protocal that was used in the book `DMT-the spirit molecule'-IV-- 

  I put the crystals in a spoon with some water --heat it with a match--watch it melt into the water--draw it up into a syringe--smack a vein and bammm ----

 Within 5 seconds --it is completely overwhelming--fractal and geometric visions of every imaginable texture ,pattern and width spill out in front of my eyes- because of the smoked DMT experience I decide not to freak out and realize I will get to the other side of this intact but was in fight or flight mode with my heart racing and worrying if my heart and head would make these next few seconds alive--who could I call?--what would happen if I screamed for help-??---relax ---let it happen---I go to sink and hurl---again and again ---nothing is coming out of me--what the f*\&k am I doing?---why did I do this?---I remember what it was like to be sober-to have friends--to be loved--- before the death of all those people who have passed from this place--before the problems-before the divorce-before the jobs--before the money--before school and people and relationships and all those brilliant moments of clarity and bliss and pain and tears and joy and laughter and love and why was I here in the middle of this existence at this time in history?--with all the hate and misunderstandings and senseless violence and awesome discoveries that could take us back to where we started--that place--that room --I've been here before --when??  where?? who was I then??who am I now??  ----and then this incredible moment occurred

--it felt like warm paint had been poured all over my body as I sat in the lotus position and I was immune to everything-all hope and fear and for one fleeting moment I revelled as if I was weightless in mid-air covered and surrounded by this tactile sympathy that had saved me from some place in the future or past but certainly not this present moment --this person was calling me --telling me from some existence yet to be lived that I would vist this moment again and all the events that transpired were there to get me here--so that I would never have to search again because it was here all along--waiting for me. That elusive spiritual experience was something I did not have to look for ---it had been waiting to find me--- 
I currently have been clean and sober for 8 months and neither wish to relive or close the door on this and all those other experiences --- finally-I get it and realize that I did,in fact, break on through to the other side.
