Anyhow, so it happens that one of my intrepid pals discovers this stuff called Blue Lotus (Nymphaea caerulea, if you want to be technical) and we were naturally intrigued by the trip reports so we bought 100 grams of the shit (its really, really cheap and legal).  Plus, if you've ever read the Odyssey and heard of the land of the Lotus-Eaters you just have to try something that's so connected to our Western Heritage (I'll admit, we're all really big dorks).  I mean shit, Homer knew about this stuff so he must have been a druggie?  So we decided to give it a shot.  



Time 0:00

First we all smoke some weed out of the bong (a nice water tube) with a slide that can easily hold about .3 grams of weed so I believe that between the five of us we finish off the weed pretty quickly.



Time 0:30

Ok we're all stoned (and we all know what that's like) so lets try some lotus and hey, we have plenty of lotus so we pack the slide about 6 or 7 bowls of lotus, lotus is a lot lighter than weed so you can't pack as much into a bowl but I presumed we smoked about 3 grams after I reweighed our big bag `o Lotus.  



The lotus doesn't do much at first but its a very pleasant smoking experience; the smoke tastes and smells wonderful and it masks cannabis odors effectively, but it is a little harsh on the throat (some members of my normal group were complaining of how much there throat hurt the next day, but that could be because we smoked a LOT that night, irregardless I felt fine the next morning i.e. when I'm writing this).



Time 1:00



Its about one hour and the cannabis wears off and the lotus starts to fill in.  I feel very relaxed and slightly sedated; I feel that I can, if I so desire go to sleep at will (I'm an insomniac, so i usually pick up on drugs that may be potential sleep aids very quickly).  So far nothing great here; I kinda of wish I had more weed.



Time 1:15-20



Ok, now were getting somewhere\ldots but where?  One person in the room said, `I feel kinda of weird\ldots but in a good way!'  This is a pretty good description.  I felt a general sense of peacefulness and well-being, mild but there.  It was difficult to place the exact nature of the effect: do i feel good b/c my body is really relaxed or is this stuff actually effecting my mind?  I think its actually a little bit of both.  



Although i felt fully cognizant the entire time and my memory of the experience is clear, I know that damn lotus was doing something to our heads b/c people were not making sense, conversations were breaking down a bit, ciggarettes were being lit at the filter, i.e. basic stupid stuff that indicates that despite whatever you're currently thinking your mind's definitely being affected.  I'm positive that we didn't get the stupids from the weed `cause 4 out of the 5 of us there had been smoking weed everyday for at least the last 3 months, some of us for years.  So we really don't get giggly or even the munchies anymore, just high.



Time 1:30



By this point I start to notice that colors and lights are much brighter and vivider than before.  And i also noticed the lights; whenever I look at something or try to focus on something it emits a kind of light.  Its hard to describe, but it was definitely still there when I closed my eyes.  Hmmmm, well if you close your eyes and gently rub your eyelids till you start to see lights and then imagine that constantly overlaying anything I look at and I guess you have a pretty good idea as to what I saw.  



I usually get like that after I smoke a lot of cannabis but I noticed that the blue lotus made it come on a lot stronger and last longer.  Not unpleasant but nothing particularly interesting.  I'm not sure if anyone else had this effect, b/c I neglected to ask.  I should also note that I am personally very prone towards hallucinations; I tend to trip harder and longer on less of most every hallucinogen I've ever tried.  So maybe the lights effect was just unique to my brain or others whose brains have a trippy bent; I don't know.



1:50

I'm getting bored so I try ingesting another two grams and then I go downstairs to my room and pour a triple shot of vodka. The vodka goes down fine and seems to be quite pleased when it reaches the lotus at the bottom.  So I'm thinking, ok, i've smoked a shit load, ate some, and now had some vodka so I'm gonna get one of those crazy trips that some of the other posts talk about, right?



2:10-20

We decide to go out for dinner since its about 7:45pm and everyone's really hungry.  I notice my body has a certain languid fluidity to it.  Walking is fun and enjoyable, I feel giddy and euphoric.  The lights are much more prominent than before.  However, my mind still seems unclouded and my memory is clear; I'm on to something, I think, but am I at the threshold and I just haven't stepped through yet?



3:00 



By this time dinner's over and with all that food (we had pizza, a medium pepperoni and a medium mushroom, chicago style).  Dinner was relaxed and sedate; there was little talking but then again no one felt the need or the desire; we were all enjoying the pleasant effects of the Lotus.



However, by the time we paid and walked back we could feel the effects wearing off.  So we decided to try again with this Lotus; this time we decided to brew some tea!



So I put exactly 15 grams, three Camile (sp?) tea bags from Celestial Seasoning, and a bunch of suger into a hot pot filled with water.  I let it simmer on low heat, just that level were you get a few bubbles not a full blown boil and constantly mixed it with a chop stick.  



3:30



The taste was very interested.  It was extremly bitter at first but there was a sweet after taste too it; it seems the camile tea and the sugar made it work very well together (although, I think adding some honey would have improved the taste as well).  After several sips I soon found the tea to actually be rather pleasant and have a very sophisticated flavor (I think I'll probably brew up future cups simply b/c I love the taste so much, its really unique).  We imbibed this elixer eagerly and eagerly awaited the results.  Of course while we waited we smoked two more bowls of weed and some more Lotus (about another 2 grams). 



4:00



I felt like I did before when I smoked it and didn't drink it but I think all this Lotus in my body's made me come up quicker.  



4:20



Ok, now the lights are back and the mild euphoria and the peace of mind.  The fluidity's not here though; that seems to be an effect that only shows up when lotus is combined with alcohol.  



5:45



The lotus had more or less worn off and the group breaks up for sleep/work/etc.  I don't feel any adverse side effects nor do I feel unusually tired as I usually do after a heavy weed smoking session.  Instead, I stayed up the rest of the night reading, cleaning, doing laundry.  I did't feel different, just sober.



In retrospect, I think Blue Lotus is a pretty lame drug.  Some of reports compare it to codeine, mdma, and opium.  I've had plenty of codeine, mdma, and opium in my time and I can say that Blue Lotus doesn't hold a candle to these drugs.  Sure I felt relaxed, codeine and opium will do that, but they do I much better job of it.  Take a tylenol 3 and I'll have trouble getting up after 45 minutes or so; smoke Lotus until I'm blue in the face and I still can't come close to one pill.  Sure add some alcohol and I'll get giddy and euphoric, but just because it inspires a sense of well being doesn't make it like MDMA. In fact, no one felt anything like the intense feelings of joy, happiness, warmth, etc. that MDMA inspires.  It does resemble opium in the sense that after we smoked a bunch of this Blue Lotus we spent most of our time lounging around reading back issues of High Times, just chilling, instead of getting into an animated conversation, which is what we normally do when we get fucked up.   

That desire to lounge and do nothing and just be calm and enjoy your suroundings quietly reminded me greatly of opium, minus the obvious narcotic effect of opium and its ability to dilate time.  



Personally, it seems to me that lotus is something i should smoke as a night cap right before bed; its a terrific sleep aid.  I also think it may be useful as a good come down drug in combination with cannabis, maybe after a hard night of snorting coke, rolls, etc.?  However, I believe that the drug may offer 3 possible alternatives for further recreational (ab)use.  Other reports have noted that steeping large amounts of lotus in red wine seems to be extremly effective.  I plan on steeping two bottles of cabernet (or merlot if I'm in the mood) in 20 grams of Lotus, each.  I figure I have a high tolerance for alcohol and lotus by now, so 20 grams steeped in wine should do something.  The extra fluidity that arrives with just a little alcohol is very interesting; I definitely want to explore that some more.  I bet if I got really, really drunk and then tried some lotus I might be getting somewhere.  Throughout the trip, especially after I imbibed a few shots I felt I was on the cusp of something but i just couldn't put my finger on it nor could I push myself past the threshold.



Another method would be finding someway to concentrate the active ingredients of Blue Lotus and then take it that way.   I haven't found lotus extract online nor do I know of a way to extract stuff naturally out of plants so i'm just going to skip this option.



Finally, salvia and Blue Lotus are suppose to have an excellent synergy together.  Personally, I can't stand salvia so i'll let the rest of my group try that combo (they trip on salvia all the time).

Be safe
