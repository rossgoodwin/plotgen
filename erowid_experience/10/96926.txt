Prior to my first outing for the world famous Camp Bisco, I had entertained maybe a dozen occasions of suspected encounters with 2C-C-NBOMe. I say suspected because, until Bisco, I had only ever had it on blotter, and it had been sold to me as LSD. Having numerous experiences with LSD, however, I was able to clearly tell the difference, and 2c-c NBOME was the only chemical whose description matched the effects I had observed. Well, considering how inexpensive 2C-C-NBOMe is compared to LSD on everybody's favorite global free market website, I decided to invest in a dozen capsules of 300ug 2C-C-NBOMe.



T-0.00; 3:00 p.m.

150ug insufflated, 150ug administered sublingually. A rise in energy is noticeable immediately, and within five minutes a marked---but manageable---confusion has set in. I am at Bisco by myself, but I have tripped by myself in the past without problems, and am confident that I will eventually run into one of a dozen or so friends who I know are here as well.



T-1.00; 4:00 p.m.

The music I am witnessing at the festival is beginning to take on an extra dimension to it. A rising euphoria is gripping me while I make use of my moderate increase in energy to dance to my heart's content, feeling as though I am a swaying part of a crowd that is all one unit



T-3.00; 6:00 p.m.

I make use of a brief break in the music to return to my campsite and reload on water and food briefly. With the lack of music, the extent to which I am tripping sets in, and at this point I would estimate that level to have been a low +2. I am aware at the time that it is the peak of this dose, and it has been a pleasant---although not incredibly intense---experience up to this point.



T-6.00; 9:00 p.m.

I feel as though the trip from the first dose is almost entirely over, and as I am watching an incredible set from the Disco Biscuits and know that I will be up listening to music for another 9+ hours, I decide to redose. Because of the overall lack of intensity in the first trip of the day, I decide to insufflate another full 300ug dose.



T-6.05; 9:05 p.m.

Again, I can feel the effects of the 2C-C-NBOMe nearly immediately, but something feels markedly different about the comeup on the second dose; it is much ``speedier,'' almost cocaine-like, and there is a rapidly growing feeling of disorientation. Around this time I recognize a friend of mine in the crowd, and take comfort in seeing a familiar face.



T-6.30; 9:30 p.m.

The Disco Biscuits opening live set is incredible. I am fully enveloped in their state-of-the-art visual show as well as their amazing musical chemistry. There is some sort of growing unrest inside me, however, which is causing me to want to wander to a different stage. As it turns out, I had reason to. One of my favorite artists was about to play on another stage, but I simply was too confused to remember. So, unsure of my motive but trusting my judgment, I left my friend's side and departed for the dance tent. I was on my own again, but I was not worried. I reached the dance tent just before Kill The Noise was set to play, and secured a front row spot for what would become the most insane hour and a half of my life.



T-8.00; 11:00 p.m.

The music is in total discord, so jarring and unsettling, but at the same time so perfect for a trip. The heavy hitting sounds seem to conduct through my body like waves, pulling me back and forth, and I am seeing an undeniable beauty in pure chaos. I am beginning to have intense closed eye visuals, and open eye distortions. I can tell that I am not yet at my peak, and fear that I may end up tripping much harder than I anticipated. I find myself over and over again returning to the thought that the second dose may have truly kicked-in the first dose, as the initial trip was weaker than expected. Almost out of nowhere there seems to be an insufferable heat bearing down upon me. I had noticed that the dance tent was rather hot, but suddenly I got the sensation of being trapped in a sauna. I am beginning to remember that in past experiences, while tripping very hard on 2C-C-NBOMe, I had encountered very intense alternating chills and heat flashes, and I am hoping that my mind is just momentarily playing tricks on me.



My mental state is very erratic, and I am almost entirely caught in my own mind. I am entranced by the sensation of playing puppet master to my own body, at various points seeming to fully exit my physical body and control is from some vantage point above. I am very quickly losing a sense of self, and this is even more disorienting as I have never experienced an ego loss so rapidly or so intensely. I am, simultaneously, having a complete and coherent dialogue with a nameless, formless entity which I can't help but describe as God. From moment to moment, I am occasionally able to break through my confusion in order to calm my growing panic at this surprisingly intense trip, knowing that this was, in fact, what I had desired to happen in the first place. I am still being guided comfortably by the incredible music and atmosphere, although people's faces around me are beginning to distort and appear almost menacing.



T-8.30; 11:30 p.m.

The amazing set by Kill The Noise has ended, and taking his place are two well-known Electro-House DJ's. Initially, despite my yet intensifying trip, I am comforted by the feeling that my mind is being chauffeured on a journey by some of the most talented artists in the world. This is quickly replaced by panic, however, as I realize that the music has become repetitive, boring, and sloppy, and I have fully forgotten that I have the capability of leaving this stage to go to another. I take a small amount of MDMA (no more than 50mg) in the hopes that I will like the music more, and that it might pull me slightly out of the trip, which hasn't yet peaked. This seems to give me a small amount of energy, but does not alter the trip at all.



T-9.00; 12:00 a.m.

This is the peak of my experience, without a doubt. I feel as though I have a fever blazing hotter than the surface of the sun, only to suddenly feel freezing cold and stand in the middle of a crowd clutching my body for warmth. I am desperately trying to recognize a familiar face anywhere in the crowd, and I believed I had probably a dozen times before realizing that I was projecting faces I knew onto people I didn't. I am at a strong +3, being in a completely distinct reality upon closing my eyes, and having distortions and warping with my eyes open. I am afraid that my body may be overheating, which is causing me to panic more, and I also can't shake the feeling that I'm sweating out too much water, even though I knew full well I was plenty hydrated. I still haven't remembered that I have the ability to leave this stage, although the performance is becoming more and more unsatisfactory. 



The voice of God is pelting me with questions, telling me that this was the experience I had asked for, that I had played around with powerful substances for too long without consequence. At the same time I have completely lost a sense of self, which is actually somewhat calming as far as a fear of death goes. The sounds of whispers are beginning to rise to a deafening level in my ears, and auditory hallucinations are setting in.



T-9.30; 12:30 a.m.

I am so frightened, on the verge of full panic when, suddenly, it finally occurs to me that there are other performances that I would enjoy better. Unsure of my ability to navigate the grounds, but determined to regain myself, I set out for another dance tent. After staggering along for a few minutes, I find myself in the most beautiful, calm place with the most amazing, chilled-out break beat electronic hip hop music playing. I sit down in the sparse crowd, feeling an ineffable sense of serenity, and pure contentment---not ecstasy---passes through me in waves too powerful to contain. Tears of joy stream from my eyes as tranquility erupts from my entire body. During all of this, I notice that I have miraculously managed to take a seat next to one of my closest friends, and a final sigh of relief washes over me.



T-15.00; 6:00 a.m.

Although the trip had been gradually decreasing in intensity since midnight, no real significant changes had occurred since I had found inner peace at around 12:30. I am now fully exhausted and ready to fall asleep, knowing that I have overcome one of the most jarring experiences of my life.



All in all, this trip was incredibly valuable in terms of spiritual content, but its mechanism of operation was far too fickle for my liking. 2C-C-NBOMe is incredibly powerful, but also has quite a propensity to turn dark on me at a moment's notice, in a way that pure LSD or mescaline does not. One of my major motives for writing this report was to make note of an effect which I have not seen anyone else note anywhere---the alternating intense chills and hot flashes---but which I have experienced multiple times on 2C-C-NBOMe. This substance can be enlightening, beautiful, tumultuous, and terrifying all at once.
