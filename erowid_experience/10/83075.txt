6:15pm: Dosed with my friend. 20-23mg.



7:15pm: No changes. Went downtown for New Years. Nothing yet. 



8:00pm: Fireworks start. From the 19th floor of an office building, the city looks strange, glowing in a way that seems almost foggy and surreal. An intense nausea hits me. Fireworks are stunning but I am distracted by worrying about if and when I am going to vomit. 



8:05pm: Leave to go throw up in the bathroom. Hallucinations hit me like a brick, kaleidoscopic patterns in the tiles, toilet paper roll expanding as if wet and then shrinking, edges growing and reaching outwards. The toilet appears to `Yawn' as I bend over it. My body hurts.



8:15pm: We walk home. The entire time I feel sick and keep waiting to throw up. When we get home, the hallucinations are very intense. Much like mushrooms, object appear to ripple, glow, melt, warp, breathe, and bulge. I finally vomit. A lot. I notice that unlike mushrooms and other psychedelics, there is no mental fog or distortion of emotion. Everything is very clear. It comforts me that I can communicate and act totally normal, despite the fact that what I am seeing is very much not in reality at all.



8:30pm: Things shimmer. Objects like carpet become almost like reflective surfaces. I see shining things dart past my field of vision like fireflies. There is a distinct lag of moving objects. If I move my hand in front of my face, there is a blur, like lights leave in the darkness when they move quickly. At one point, I have to lie down and focus on one specific thing because looking at something broad, like an entire room, is overwhelming. I am very dizzy, and still extremely nauseous, although there is nothing left in my stomach to expel. My friend says he feels the same. I become extremely cold and shiver uncontrollably. 



8:45pm: We leave to go his friends house. I throw up again before we go, and am still not relieved of my nausea and physical discomfort. When I look in the mirror, my pupils are like dish plates, but I can only look at them for a few seconds before they begin to bulge, melt, and slowly droop down the rest of my face. Strange\ldots  



9:00-11:00pm: Colours are outstanding. The visuals are still very strong, but no longer overwhelming. The nausea passes in intervals before coming back again. It's a very unwelcome distraction from the hallucinations. I watch a Hendrix poster as the colours undulate, transitioning from muted to explosive. The red looks like brilliant fire, the blue becomes like a sage green, then back to white, then to blue again. A 40 year old virgin poster is rather strange\ldots  I am fascinated by Steve Carells face melting off, leaving just a bare skeletal outline with skin plastered over it, wearing a grimacing smile as his eyes twist around in his head, sometimes staring at me. I decide this is bad energy and focus on something else. It's not upsetting though, as I said before, there is no distortion of emotion or extreme focus on positive and negative energies. Emotion is not influenced by these things. 



I prefer to not talk during the experience, but it is not difficult to communicate when I want to. I appear totally lucid, save my wandering and fascinated eyes. My neck hurts very badly, as if it is holding a lot of tension. Finally I lie down to ease some of this discomfort. It works momentarily. I find that I cannot get in a comfortable position no matter what I do. I play with a very small kitten. It's fur expands and contracts, making it appear like a breathing puffball. 



12:00pm: Happy New Years! Hallucinations are almost entirely gone. I can't remember when they ceased but they have, almost as instantaneously as they occurred. 



General Notes: I feel that there is very little `come up' and `come down' with this drug. It hits me without notice, and with much force, and leaves just as quickly. Four hours was a good time period for this drug to be in my system, as it is quite overwhelming and uncomfortable at times. The nausea and vomiting definitely put a damper on the experience as a whole, although I don't regret trying this out. 



The lucidity and clarity of it prevented me from getting `positive' or `negative' with the experience. It simply `was.' At the same time, it made me focus more on the `reality' of the situation and lacked the mystical element that, for example, shrooms have. I would say to anyone trying this for the first time to make sure you're in a situation where you can easily make it to the bathroom in case you need to vomit. There was no body high or physical sensation heightening, but there was a significant bodily discomfort that I think most people experience in their stomach. Good luck.
