I don't remember what type of acid it was.  I just remember it being a `gel tab' full of purple shit that was sour as fuck.  I was 14 at the time and when I took it nothing happened for about half an hour to an hour.  Then all of a sudden everything just got completely fuct up.  I remember talking to my friend and every word he said was rhyming (he was doing this on purpose because he knew I was tripping) and it was freaking me out.  Well after he left I just sat in my room and listened to music.  I couldnt even tell what CD or song I was listening too.  I decided to take a shower and went to my closet to get some clothes.  When I opened the closet a bloody human hand fell out and touched my leg, I didnt think anything of it though.  I just sort of kicked it back into the closet grabbed a shirt and some pants and headed up to the bathroom to take a shower.  Well halfway up the stairs I remember thinking, `What The FUCK!! OH MY GOD!'  



So I ran back downstairs and opened my closet again.  Nothing was there.  `Ok Good' I thought, as I turned around something caught my eye.  It was a puddle of blood on the floor and slowly I began to see a dead body.  I immediately began to freak out.  I blinked and it was gone, but then it was there again! WTF!  Well I thought to myself, must be the acid and didnt think anything about it.  As I was taking a shower time seemed to slow down so much, I actually believed that I had transcended space and time boundaries and that I was in a slow motion world.  Well I finished taking my shower and everything was still slow as fuck.  Until my mom came out of her room and said `Hi.'  She did this in about .0002 seconds and before I knew she was even there she was gone.  I dont know how long later (all the clocks were displaying some sort of fuct up symbols and the analog clock's hands were so blurred I couldnt tell where they were) but I ended up outside, and it was dark as shit.  I remember trying to open a window to get in, but this window was about 7 feet off the ground, at the time I was only about 5' 5'.  



This was the craziest shit in the world.  The window looked like it was about 20 feet over my head but when I reached for it my hand stretched to accomodate for this.  The next thing I knew I had a knife in my hand and the next thing I knew after that was that my hand was bleeding.  I couldnt get in the fucking house! AND now I was fucking bleeding!  `Oh know' I thought `What the fuck am I going to do?? Im trapped outside and the sky is trying to eat me and Im going to die.'  My neighbor comes outside about a minute later and says `What happened to your hand???'  I said something along the lines of `Smick smurgen with cut an. . . I DIE!'  I dont remember much after this but I do remember that I never stopped tripping. I woke up the next morning hearing gun fire, and seeing the wall melt.  



2 weeks later this was still going on.  I didn't do anything about it till about a year ago.  I took 15 xanex at school, plus 20 blood thinners in an attempt to kill myself.  I ended up falling down the fucking stairs and getting busted.  They searched me and found my remaining xanex and remaining blood thinners.  Our Nazi (School Campus officer, formerly a navy seal or some shit) brought out a huge book with every pill in it and they started looking it up.  I said, `Well I'll be dead in about (looked at my watch) 5 seconds.'  `How many did you take son??!' said officer peabody. `Oh about 15 of the blue footballs and 20 of the yellow capsules, why?  You dont think I like speaking in english? Well your wrong, im speaking english right now! SEIG HEIL!'  well I was in an ambulance, then I woke up and I was drinking charcoal, then I was in a stretcher going down a narrow hallway, then I had to walk to a couch!  You know how hard this shit is?  I had to get interviewed. . .interviewed for what I was thinking.  



`Where am I?' I asked the old fuck asking me questions.  He said `Your at Summit Ridge Mental institute. . .'  Well a few days later I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and now Im on like 9 medications and it totally blows. so all you little fucks that think you can buy euphoria for not more than 5 dollars a hit, think again.  You may end up killing, yourself or someone else.
