It should have been a bad trip, but it wasn't. 



I heard that acid was in town at the beginning of the week. It had always been the holy grail of hallucinogens, something I'd wanted to try since I knew of it's existance. I found a friend, we'll call him E., to trip with and decided on that Friday to drop. We waited around all day after school and finally got in touch with my guy. It turned out he had sold all of his. We were disheartened, until he told us there were still two hits left in the next town over, a 30 minute drive. I wasn't about to let a little drive stop me. We drove over and got our two hits. Acid is really rare in our area. I was surprised that these small pieces of paper were going to throw us into a world of psychedelia. I put mine on my tounge as soon as I got it and E. did the same. We took some friends to the store and got a 40oz. to split later in the night.



On the drive back (DO NOT DRIVE WHILE TRIPPING. IT WAS STUPID THING FOR ME TO DO.) I started feeling the first little `something's about to happen' tingles.  I looked at my pupils and couldn't see the coulor of my eyes. This was it! 



When we arrived back in town we went back to my friend's (P.) house and sat down. This is where I made my first mistake of the night. One of my friends was having a birthday party that night and they all wanted rolls. Myself being able to get them most anytime said sure, as I wasn't tripping that hard yet. On the way to meet the X guy I noticed colours getting brighter and we both got a bad case of the giggles. We got to the gas station where we were to meet the X guy. While we were sitting in the parking lot waiting for him I really started to feel it. Colors were shifting BIG TIME and I couldn't stop laughing. We got the tabs and drove back to P's. house.



So far so good right? Wrong. I sat down on P's bed, and some of my other friends started playing trippy music on the keybord and bass. This was nuts. I was really feeling it strong now and it was amazing. Suddenly one of my friends comes in and says `Dude, come outside right now.' I didn't know what was going on, so I went outside. He had backed into my car. My sideview mirror was hanging off and my door made a sickening crunching noise whenever it was opened. I started freaking out, and everyone did their best to keep me calm. I finally just said fuck it, I wasn't going to let it ruin my night and drove off in my badly crippled car. This was stupid. I was almost peaking and driving around in a fucked up car. 



 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#  



We got to the party and handed out the tabs. I drank my beer raving about how I was going to get it from my mother in the morning. I went into the kitchen, a place I had been many times before and it seemed totally alien. This is when the ego loss really began. I couldn't really talk. Someone asked me if I could roll a joint and I nodded, proceeding to roll a pretty nice one, considering my condition. We went into the back yard. I layed down in the grass and it was amazing. I had no idea what was happening. People talked and it sounded like an entirely different language. I remember seeing the street light and thinking I must have left earth. It cast a strange glow over everybody and I was gone. I think someone convinced me to bang my head into a pillow, because it would feel good. I was at this point incapable of driving, so I let another friend (K) drive my car. He did fine, and riding in the passenger seat seemed very strange to me, like it wasn't even my car I was in. We got to the park and stayed there for a few hours. I remember the grass shifting and people dancing. Tried to roll another joint, but it didn't work out as well. Took me 30 minutes. 



At around 1:30 E's mom called and said she wanted him home. She offered to pick him up. And here comes mistake number 2. I decided I was tired of being there and said I would give him a ride home. So we take everyone back to the house and head back to E's house. When we're almost there I see flashing lights up ahead. Oh shit. Cops. But it wasn't just one cop. `SOBRIETY CHECKPOINT' read the sign with the flashing light. Fuck. I, of course did the stupid thing and made a big turn on the road right before the sign. Exactly why they placed it there. Of course, when I look in my rearview mirror I see a car staying about a block behind me with it's headlights off. Me and E start throwing all the pills we had left out the window. When we got about 2 blocks down the road the lights came on. `Is this really happening?' E asked me. Yes. It was really happening.



`STEP OUT OF THE VEHICLE WITH YOUR HANDS UP' came over the loudspeaker Both E and I got out. `JUST THE DRIVER.' E got back in and I walked toward the cop car when they told me too. I wasn't really still tripping when we started this drive, but those cop lights took me back. I put my hands on the hood of the police car. `Why'd you avoid my checkpoint back there boy?' asked the officer. `It was the right way to go.', I muttered, realizing I must sound like a total lunitic. He gave me a bit of field sobriety, waving my liscense in front of my face telling me to follow it with my eyes. I wanted to ask him which liscense he wanted me to follow. The tracers were incredible. It looks like one big line of them, flowing back and fourth. After searching my car and finding nothing, he asked me a few more questions. The story I came up with was stuttered and full of holes. I was shaking really really badly. Finally, they just told me that I was out after curfew and I agreed. The last thing he asked was if I had a dead body in my trunk. `Not to my knowledge, officer.'



`Get the hell out of here kid.' Shocked, I walked back to my car. Was it some kind of trick? No. To this day I have no idea why he let me go. Gave us our cigarettes back too. I took E home and went back to P's house and told them my story. I was completely down by this point but still feeling very strange. P wanted weed and I said I would get some, on the condition that someone else would drive. We took the interstate this time. We ended the night by smoking out my friend's car. A strange night. 



I've grown up a lot since then, I hope. It was the first and only time I tripped acid, although I wouldn't be against trying it again some time in the future. Next time though, I'm going to approach it with a much different attitude. One of respect.
