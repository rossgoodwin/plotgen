As I write this I am coming down from one of the most intensely wonderful highs I think I've ever experienced.



To put it plainly, I had my apartment to myself this weekend. I was scrounging around the internet (CL) for a random weed hookup but ended up meeting someone who said they had Tina to share. For those not in the know, Tina is often referred to as `glass.'



The first time I encountered it was actually about 6 years ago in Seattle, when I was about 23. I was hardcore into the clubbing scene and was a regular E partier. One fateful trip to Seattle to meet up with good friends led me to Tina. We started our weekend with E, and as the night wore on, my friend suggested we bump it up with glass. Always open to new suggestions we tried it. We actually snorted it. To skip ahead a little: after having smoked it tonight, I much prefer snorting it instead. Hard to decsribe. I just think it's more fun, like doing coke, almost nostalgic. 



But I digress\ldots 



Almost immediately after snorting the stuff we all felt like we'd just woken up from a long, peaceful night's sleep. That said, we partied on until the sun came up, ended up in a spa, and ultimately didn't get to sleep until some 50 hours after we started to party with E. Of course, in between we dabbled with some K. It was a night with the alphabet. Looking back, it was stupid to mix like that but, hey, we were young and fearless. 



So\ldots back to tonight\ldots 



As I said, I found a guy who was willing to share some Tina. When I told him about my limited experience, that I'd never actually smoked it before, he comfortingly said he'd `teach' me. Yes, this is getting corny but, really, it was that innocent. By the way, I totally went out on a limb and hooked up with someone I had never met. Be advised that this is not the smartest thing to do. However, we chatted online for a long time and so had developed a rapport. After the fact it was well worth it but now I am getting after myself for taking such a stupid risk. For all I knew he could have been an axe murderer or had me smoke crack or something laced with acid or something. Hard to say but I just felt he was trustworthy -- but how stupid of me!!!



Anyway, nervous as hell I went out and bought a six pack of beer thinking it would calm my nerves. It did, and by the time my new friend showed up I wasn't drunk but very well buzzed. I was relaxed enough and ready. Mind you the guy I met up with was this young asian and had a VERY thick accent. It was all quite funny, he knew exactly what I was saying, having lived in the states for 17 years, but his accent was so thick that I constantly had to ask him to repeat himself. Anyway, I digress again\ldots (mind you I am coming down, yet still QUITE high). It was funny as hell!



After a few minutes of friendly, although confusing, banter he whipped out his little, clear glass pipe. Again, I'd never smoked it and seeing the pipe gave me the immediate and yucky (no offense to those out there who smoke it) association with drugs like crack, etc., which, I guess, is what kept me from it for so long. The stigma associated with that shit. Anyway, he loaded his pipe and started it up. He toked, I toked, a few times he shotgunned me. As I started to get high the feeling of his lips against my was intense. I am gay but kissing has never been all that for me. It was an odd experience to find myself enjoying something I wouldn't normally enjoy, but I guess that's the point!? Go figure.



So, we must have smoked a rock or two by which time I was really starting to feel it. The high is very different from it's sister, coke. It was very slow to start up and the peak lasted for at least two hours. I am still WAY high and the last time I took a hit was an hour and a half ago. 



Ok, this is started to get really long so I will try to get to the point!



The high, in general, is much like E. The euphoria, body high, etc. It was surprisingly different from coke, too. Coke gets me high REALLY hard and fast, probably from snorting it, but Tina was so nice and very gradual. It let me feel at ease and not sort of out of control. My friend told me that it was very expensive and from a very reputable source in San Francisco. 



Another thing about Tina, it makes me really horny. My friend who came didn't come for sex but we soon found ourselves rubbing each others arm, talking (I get talky on Tina like on E or Coke) and soon we progressed to an all out make out session. Totally not something I was after but everything felt so amazing -- it just felt like the natural next step. 



To spare this from turning into a detailed porn log, we had an AWESOME time. To make things even more intense, we huffed poppers every so often as well. As anyone who's tried Tina will tell you: an erection is impossible. The poppers almost provided a distraction of sorts and allowed things to, well, engorge. It also provided an AMAZING kick to the Tina high. Tonight was the first time I'd every really, seriously tried poppers, too. I did once before a few years ago but all it did was give me a massive headache. This stuff, however, at \$30 a bottle was SO intense. No headache at all. 



I guess some might chastise me for combining stuff but it was there, I felt comfortable, and so I went with the flow. Enough said. Besides, I was kind of remeniscing about my time in Seattle years back. =)



Anyway, we smoked a bit more, another rock or two (and when I say `rock' I am referring to something about the size of a large grain of sand, or a very very small pebble. He had what he said was about \$100 worth and it was in a little baggie about one inch square (for those curious enough about that sort of thing).



Ok, long story short (yes I know I said that earlier\ldots just roll with me here), the high was amazing, almost trippy. The music we were playing was intense like on E, everything felt incredible, and when, after almost two hours and one VERY sore arm later, we both managed to `finish'. I thought my head was going to explode, no pun intended. As we came down a little, we smoked a few ciggies, had a LOT of water, and sort of fell into one of those cool conversations one finds themselves in when coming down on E. I still couldn't understand a damn thing he was saying but there were moments of lucidity and we got along smashingly. 



A word of advice: don't drink a lot of beer beforehand as I did. I've been drinking water for an hour but I still feel very dehydrated. Rightly so, there was an wet outline of our bodies on the sofa.
