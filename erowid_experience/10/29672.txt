How I Spent My New Year's, 2003-2004.



Some background: I'm on 40 mg fluoxetine per day and 400 mg acyclovir (anti-viral) twice a day. Did 500 mg dimenhydrinate a few weeks previous and experienced very little besides jellylegs, drowsiness and dry mouth. And, I should add, I had been drinking caffeine for most of the day, a bit more than usual, but no pills or anything. Setting was my house, which I share with my roommate and my mum. I figured my mum was going to bed early, since she's recovering from surgery, and I was bored and had nothing to do. I figured tonight was as good a time as any to try again with the dimenhydrinate. 



Approximately 1930: Ingested 1 gram dimenhydrinate in the form of generic Dramamine--20 tablets.



2010: Jellylegs coming on quickly, also mild dry mouth and what I would call a `chill touch', my fingertips felt like ice when I touched my face. I was watching the South Park movie with my roommate, and my perception was skewed so that I had to ask her if, for example, the colour of the American general's face was actually changing, it does, from the green glowing map he has, or if it was just me. Things seemed more vivid, my environment more intense.



And then there was the twitching. This may have been partially potentiated by the caffeine, but plain caffeine never made me twitch like this. My hands shook uncontrollably, as did my knees whether I was standing or sitting. When I sat down, I had the `restless leg' thing going on, with both legs. I found it quite amusing, except when I tried to write.



2030: Difficulty walking, slight nausea. Same chill touch and twitchiness, plus I was becoming very clumsy, not quite like a lack of gross motor control, but just clumsiness almost like my depth perception had gone and I wasn't able to tell where my body was going. Trouble putting things down, trouble writing, kept bumping into things.



2100: Severe dry mouth, and what seemed like brief periods of deafness, as if I had stuck earplugs in my ears. By this point, my short-term memory was about completely gone. I would pause in the middle of a sentence, and my train of thought would instantly derail. I would go looking for something, then forget what it was I left the room for. 



Now, because of past DXM use and the fluoxetine (I suspect), this happens to me fairly often, the forgetting-what-you-came-in-the-room-for thing. But in this case, it was *bad*. I'd even forget what I was talking about while I was talking, and just trail off. 



2112: Eyes unable to focus. Tried chewing this dry mouth gum I have but it did nothing. Settled for brushing my teeth and using mouthwash, and avoiding sugar. Listerine tastes very strange on Dramamine. 



2240: Added 100 mg, I'm not sure why. o\_O Occasional waves of nausea, but was able to keep stomach contents down. I should point out I have a rather strong stomach, so you might want to keep a clear path to the bathroom. 



2345: I must have been peaking, because my handwriting on the notepad I used is almost completely illegible. Any letters I can make out don't make any sense. By this time, my roommate had gone to bed, and I amused myself by watching Acidwarp. I also got online and talked to a few people, including a friend of mine who was having a shitty night and called me to vent. Everything that happened around this time seemed like a dream or a hallucination, and after I went to bed and woke up, I suspected it might have been. But no, apparently not. 



I also went out for a walk around 0100, enjoying the fireworks and drunk people. I probably looked drunk myself, as I would occasionally get these waves of jellylegs-and-severe-nausea from time to time. Besides that, I found myself with some paranoia, sort of a feeling like someone was watching me, so as I walked, I was periodically looking behind me. 



It was only in the morning that I found my eyes were dilated. As I write this, a day later, they still are. Almost as if my eyes forgot to dilate while I was tripping and are making up for it now. 



In summary:



No hallucinations, except for what I believe were a few CEVs when I went to bed. 

No health problems besides the dry mouth and nausea. The caffeine seemed to work well in holding off the drowsiness and extreme gravity feeling. A body buzz and an altered sense of perception I'd compare to a 2nd plateau DXM trip. Things seemed strange, but not bad scary or totally different.



Irritating side effects, but they could be much worse. All in all, a fun trip. I'll do this again, in a setting more conducive to hallucinations. I'd definitely recommend dimenhydrinate to anyone looking for a legal trip, but of course, YMMV.
