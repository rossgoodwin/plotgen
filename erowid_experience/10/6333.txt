Day 1:

 I ground 5grms of Peganum Harmala seeds, 10 Baby Hawaiian Woodrose seeds, \& approx. 25cm of Cielo Banisteriopsis Caapi vine bark into powder. I then added 5000mlgrms of viatamin C \& boiled in a non-aluminun pot(aluminun does not react well with ayahuasca)for approx. 7 hrs. The liquid was first strained through a fine metal screen, \& then through a coffee filter. I set the liquid aside, \& re-boiled the leftovers for an additional 2 hrs. The same straining proceedure was followed, \& the liquids were combined. I then boiled the combined liquids until it reached a volume of approx. 1/2cup. This was then refrigerated.



Day 2:

 I ground 17grms of Mimosa Hostilis root bark into powder. I then minced 60 dried Psychotria Viridis leaves \& 13 fresh Psilocybe Cubensis mushroom caps. All materials were placed into a relatively larger non-aluminum pot, with the addition of 5000mlgrms more of viatamin C. This was then boiled for roughly the same amount of time as the brew from Day 1\ldots the same straining \& re-boiling methods were followed as well. The liquids were then combined \& boiled down to a volume of approx. 1cup. This also was refrigerated.



Day 3:

 I fasted all day, as well as the 2 previous preparation days. I spent my waking hrs. reading \& meditating through the creation of music on various insturments. When the feeling came upon me to ingest the forbidden liquids, it was already 9:00pm. I decided that such a combination of psycho-active plants was'nt anything to toy with, so I gathered up the manditory tools for a long night in the woods.(tent,water,cannabis,etc.) Before I left for my journey, I drank the extemely bitter MOAI/LSA tea. I figured that by the time I reached my destination, the effects would have begun to take hold.

 Half way into the thorn infested woods of the Natchez Trace, I began to feel nauseating, yet calming air of the brew. By the time I reached a spot in which I was happy with, about 30 min. had passed. I now felt that it was time to start out on the true journey, for which I had waited so long. The DMT/psilocybin tea was then removed from my bag \& swiftly ingested to avoid prolonged interaction with this nasty shit.

 

About 30 min. later, the brew was beginning to taint my existance with CEV's, \& before I knew it, vomit was upon me. I ventured off a good 30 ft. for the hacking in order to avoid smelling, stepping in, or interaction in any way with the fowl mess. The release of the brews was extremely satisfying \& welcomed\ldots I'm always game for a good puke session.



After the vomiting, I smoked a few bowls of cannabis, \& then everything was different. Within the next 20 min., all recollection myself, \& the past events were gone. I was'nt able to see trees or plants any longer. Everything took on a new shape. There were even walls of patterns \& light that appeared in front of me.(keep in mind that this was all open eye)There were images of life, light,\& sound EVERYWHERE, but I was'nt able progress toward them. Every time I attempted get closer, the walls \& beings would keep their same distance. I was able to hear 2 different dialogues - one of which I was able to understand, but the other was a combination of sounds so unlike anything I had ever heard that I almost want to say that it was'nt a voice at all, but the patternized walls making making visual sylables.

 

I had thousands of rational thoughts going on, with which I was explaining to myself what was happening in front of me, but none of them make very much sense to me now.

 

After I came to the realization that a human was'nt able to move about through this dimention, I laid down on the bare ground, closed my eyes, \& was then able to watch the walls unfold before me. A great feeling energy came over me once I understood that to exist here, you don't need a phisical self, only the idea of one.

 

I must have wandered through those walls for an eternity\ldots I was even able to make them shift \& re-shape upon will. The entire time that this was going on, the ever-so-loud dialogue in which I understood was assuring me that this place would exist forever, \& that I would meet with it much more in the future. This calmed me to no extent.

 

After lying on the ground in a timeless state, I regained the knowledge of where my physical self was, I realized that the multiple eternities in which I just experienced was only 5 hrs.!

 

I spent the rest of the night reflecting on EVERYTHING\ldots not just my hallucinogenic state, but everything that ever happened to everyone. I felt as if all knowledge was handed to me for a short period of time, \& it I felt very rewarded.

  

While reflecting, I did my best on setting up my tent, \& building a fire. I sat smoking cannabis \& watching the fire from my tent until morning - all of the time sorting through the overwhelming amount of knowledge I was given\ldots or should I say loaned.
