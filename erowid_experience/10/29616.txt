One week ago today a friend and I each consumed 6 Baby Hawaiian Woodrose seeds. I feel that I should relate what happened to the two of us that day in order to help others interested in the substance and give to something back to erowid for being such an invaluable resource.



I purchased 50 seeds from an online vendor for about \$15, because they claimed to be organically grown in Hawaii and of the highest quality. I would rather pay a few dollars more just for safety and a quality trip. Once I recieved the seeds in the mail, my friend and I decided to spend the next day at the park with the woodrose seeds to see what we might learn. 



The next day turned out to be beautiful, cool, and sunny, although a bit windy. We drove out to a nearby park situated at next to a bay. We had considered walking there so we wouldn't have to deal with any auto related distractions,  but we decided to drive at the last minute to have a shelter nearby in case we needed it. Once at the park we crushed each seed with a pair of pliers, put them all in our mouths with a bit of water, and chewed for about 5 minutes before swallowing. After lots of research I was still unsure about the preparation of the seeds. There was no fuzzy outer coating to the seeds to remove and the brown outer husk seemed like it would be next to impossible to remove without losing most of the contents. I was a little worried about the nausea, but I figured that no matter what happened it would be a learning experience. 



So we walked out into the park chewing our seeds and talking a bit. We found a nice sunny spot on a hill, sat down, and waited. After about 15 minutes we each began to feel a bit of nausea setting in which was expected but unpleasent nonetheless. I managed to take my mind off of the pain for awhile by listening to a bit of slow dub music, but we evenutally decided to take a walk to shake off the increasing nausea and the cramps that had developed in our legs. About 45 minutes had passed at this point. We were both feeling fairly weak and sick. Things felt strange and a little dreamy at this point, but nothing psychedelic.



A few minutes into the walk my friend vomited and felt much better for it. I didn't puke the entire time, although sometimes the pain made me wish I had. I just have a stomach of steel and didn't have the luxury of vomit. It proved to work to my advantange in the end though, because I didn't come down until a few hours after my friend.



We wandered around the park for another ten minutes or so in a dreamy state. It was very windy and we were both very exhauseted by this point, so we decided to make our way back to my car at the other end of the park. At times it felt like the wind was going to blow me over.



My car was only a few hundered yards away, but we had to stop once on the way to rest. I felt as if I was carrying the ring to mordor. It was a long slow walk back. It took us at least three times as long to get to my car than it should have, but it was the most amazing feeling of accomplishment to finally make it there.



So we sat in the car. Exhausted. The nausea was less prounounced now but we were both amazingly weak. I had trouble lifting bottles of water and sitting up straight. I just had to keep telling myself that to get to the top of the mountain, you have to make a difficult trek. And the more difficult the trek, the higher the mountain. Most of the time was just spent lying still, thinking about not really wanting to do this again, and listening to some music. I felt wretched and weak like the weight of the universe was on top of me. I had the urge to stretch my legs at one point, so we got out of the car and walked to the water for a bit. Still weak. Still dreamy. Nothing psychedelic. 



When we returned from the water, about 2 hours had past since we ingested the seeds. We both laid back in our seats and went back to spacing out and feeling tired. About 5 minutes later it hit me. I was soaring! I was laying back in my seat, but the pain and weakness was gone. I lay there awestruck for a period. Those of you that have had an ethnogenic eperience will know that it defies words, so I wont bother trying. Once I settled into it I sat up in my seat and looked at my friend, he was apparently feeling much better at that point too because we started into a conversation on metaphysics all of a sudden.



We spent another 2 hours just sitting in the car talking and watching things happen on the outside. We took Jesus's teaching of judge not lest ye be judged to its furthest point, so that it became an instruction of how to merge with the trancendental mind.



Too many thoughts and things crossed my mind to discuss them all. After the two hours we went back to his house. We were both still tripping, but he claimed that he was okay to drive and I trusted him. We followed the path of least resistance all the way back to his place and made it there without any trouble. It wasn't exactly the fastest way, because we went through all sorts of neighborhoods to get there, but it was quite nice.



His grandmother was there at his house, so we pretended to watch TV for awhile to appear normal. It was really too ridiculous and boring to watch so we snuck back to his room and hung out for awhile. He ate quite a bit of food and started coming down at this point, so I told him thanks and drove back home. I was still tripping so I took the path of least resistance to get there.



 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#  



My parents were home, so I preteneded to be normal for awhile with them. I had some dinner(even though I wasn't hungry), and watched part of a football game. I really didn't feel like paying attention to it, but I knew to make some sort of generic reaction to the game when everyone else did. I knew they wouldn't expect me to be tripping, so I just played it cool. After awhile I told them I was feeling a bit sick and was going to take a nap. I just wanted some time to myself. 



I took a quick shower. Checked my eyes, which were almost completely black, because my pupils were so huge. Then laid down for awhile. The most meaningful moment happened after I laid down and shut my eyes. It was about 8.5 hours after we had consumed the seeds at this point. All I can say is I percieved the center that everything issues forth from. The void. If you can visualize the world as a yin/yang, I percieved the invisible axis, which it rotates around.



I was stunned with this vision an all of its implications. About an hour later I got up and played normal for a few mintues with my parents, and then hung out in my room and watched office space(my friend later told me that he watched it too). I was happy. I was still tripping some. And I realized what an archetype the movie was. 



When I turned off the TV and closed my eyes I returned to the void which was a blessing. I percieved it until I fell asleep, which was about 11 hours after taking the seeds.



So I should give some final thoughts on the woodrose seeds I suppose. The woodrose seeds definely work. The beginning was very difficult and a dull pain remained in my stomach and legs for the remainder of the time, but I took it as a neccesary part of the learning process. I don't know if there is a good way to combat the bad side effects, but I don't know that I would even want that. The trip was more intense than my past experiences with mushrooms but I think I may have learned more from it. I usually write quite a bit on mushrooms, but all I managed to write with the woodrose seeds was `1' and `.' I think I learned more despite this. 



My friends trip didn't last as long. I suppose this was because he vomited and weighed about 10 or 15 punds more than me. But he enjoyed it nonetheless. He had some great conversations with his family after I left. And had a sense of renewal the next morning.
