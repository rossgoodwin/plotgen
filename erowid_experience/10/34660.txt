 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# 



Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to discourage anyone who even attempt to try what I did in the paragraph below.  It may be the cause of my moderate muscle cramps, that have lasted for a week and a half so far.  I'm sure they will go away, but if they don't, I don't want this to happen to anyone else, they are very persistent muscle cramps that persist in my left arm and left pectoral muscle and are agitated by smoking marijuana, eating mushrooms and just about any physical activities, making the cramps become pains that are strong enough to have me not smoking, tripping, or like I said doing just about heavy physical activity.  Like I said, I doubt they will persist for much longer, but what do I know, I'm not a doctor.  So please DO NOT ATTEMPT!!!!!!!!!!!



Last Wednesday, I recieved a call from a good friend of mine, who from here on shall be known as Sir Dysentary.  He told me he had recieved a large amount of money, and he wanted me to celebrate his graduation from high school.  His idea was simple enough, he wanted to buy some mushrooms, and some weed, and possibly some alcohol.  We would then spend the next few days in a celbrations with these substances as the `hired entertainment'.  I agreed, even though I have some apprehension about tripping with Sir Dysentary as he is a very not chill person and this would probably impact my trip. 



He came and picked me up and took me back to his house where the third member of our little expedition was waiting for us, who from here on shall be known as The Rat King.  With all of us present, it was time to go get what we needed, but then, something happened to make the next few days a total haze.  Sir Dysentary's parents are well off, and get everything that is needed.  One thing that everyone in Sir Dysentary's family needs is Ambien (Zolpidem), because they all suffer from sleeping problems.  The UPS guy dropped something off like 3 hours before we were to recieve our substances.  Just my luck, he dropped off the monthly package off perscription drugs that Sir Dysentary's family needs (and boy do they need alot of them).  I had read that crushing up ambien and snorting it up your nose can (I do stress can because not everyone experiences this) cause hallucinations, and Sir Dysentary happend to know this fact as well, but not from the same source as me, he just knew.  Well he took 8 10 mg ambiens with him and we went to my house to await the call that would get us our substances, and he made me drive because he took his shrooms already (He pre-purchased his 1/8th, bastard).



While waiting, we each crushed up 2 ambiens and took them up the nose, and when the intense burn faded I snorted another half of one bringing me to 25mg insufflated ambien.  I noticed somthing was up like 30 minutes later when my carpet started to rise and flow as if it was water.  Woah, I thought, I have never hallucinated without tripping before.  I was perfectly clear headed, except for the occasional amneisia, and a very strong feeling that someone besided us was in the room.  I also saw the grain of wood flowing in a similar manner, and when I tryed to read the words ran away from each other, nothing else noteworthy happened.  We were smoking marijuana the whole time, so that may have contributed to my hallucinations as well.  2 hours later we recieved the call, but we found that only Sir Dysentary would be able the only one tripping, all they had left was MDMA.  I didn't want to roll on X, but I also wanted to be at around the same level as Sir Dysentary, because he was getting very annoying.  So we drove out to get some rolls for me and The Rat King, with Sir Dysentary tripping in the backseat.



I made a few mistakes while driving (which I probably shouldn't have done because of the ambien in my system), I came to a complete stop at 2 different green lights (Thank god there wasn't anyone behind me, or any cops around), and only figured it out when The Rat King told me so.  I was also a little slower to react than usual, and I almost didn't notice we were low on gas, so the drive was definitely a bad idea, but I was the most capable at the moment so I had no choice. Sir Dysentary was tripping balls in the backseat, and was a constant annoyance, but also kind of entertaining.  We arrived at a friend of mines house, he gave us the rolls, which were green doves\ldots   I frowned at this because for some reason green is a bad color for X, I don't know why it just is\ldots   O well, too bad.  We thanked him for the X, and then were on our way.  The Rat King took his right away, but I had to wait because I was the `designated' driver.  When I was almost home I took it in the car, hoping that it wouldn't kick in fast, which it didn't.  We then made it safely (I'll never know how though\ldots ) back to my house.  The Rat King was starting to roll already, which meant that I didn't have much time till mine kicked in.  



Back at my house, Sir Dysentary was talking to the clothes in my closet, because he said they resembled people and were talking to him.  Strange\ldots   He was having a paticularly hard trip, I have never had clothes talk to me when I have shroomed in the past.  The Rat King was rolling pretty good now, about an hour and a half after he took his.  I was starting to feel it too, but it was olny T+0:45 for me, so I had a ways to go.  I had my music playing on my computer and a crazy visual stimualtion thing that went to the music going.  The Rat King said that he couldn't look away, and sure enough he looked almost hypnotized by the computer screen mixed with some awesome music\ldots   I started feeling the roll peak about T+1:45, I knew this when I also became hypnotized by my computer screen and the beautiful music that was playing  If anyone is looking to enjoy their roll without pointless techno music, try Blind Guardian, paticularly the album A Night at the Opera, they had me in a trance when I turned them on\ldots   



It was around this time I noticed it felt like someone had whacked me in the arm with a metal baseball bat, it really started to get sore\ldots   This has never happened to me any other time I have rolled\ldots   and I have rolled about 8 times without a problem of any kind, well until the next day anyway\ldots   This feeling persisted for the rest of the night.  The rest of my roll was pretty insignifigant, nothing out of the ordinary, jaw clenches, I took care of that with some gum, eye wiggles, and that feeling of togetherness, that I loved everyone, but I always get all that, I never have had my whole left arm and shoulder chest area feel like I had been beaten on or something.  



The next day I woke up (on 3 hours sleep) feeling the usual hang over, with one exception, I wasn't depressed at all, which is something I always experience after rolling.  I usually feel like that for a week, but I didn't have it happen at all this time, which makes me wonder if it was MDMA, and not one of it's related compounds, like MDA, PMA, you get the picture.  I should have tested the stuff, but you live and learn I guess.  Well continuing, I woke up and did the dishes really quick.  I then left with Sir Dysentary and The Rat King for Sir Dysentary's home.  First, we had to drop off The Rat King, who, like me, wanted some badly needed sleep (Which niether of us would get).  When we got to Sir Dysentary's house, his parents weren't home, so he quickly located some more Ambien, which I now regret as it was stupid to do that on no sleep, after rolling no less\ldots   I took 2 up the nose as did he.  I didn't experience anything at first, but an hour later in his car I was seeing everything move, the whole inside of his car was breathing and flowing around like it was jello or something, normally this would have floored me, but I kept having the worst amniesia, so I must have forgot it happened.  



Things were no different when we got back to his house, I tried reading only to give up when the words refused to stay put.  EVERYTHING with a pattern was moving or breathing in some way, I had that feeling that someone else was there again, we both had that destinct feeling that someone was with us.  4 hours passed almost instantly to us, all we know is one moment it was 2 o'clock in the afternoon, then it was 6:30 at night without one recollection of how it got to be that time so fast\ldots   The reason 6:30 stands out, is The Rat King called us and we went to pick him up and meet him at a girls house, who will be known as, JA Girl, we also decided we needed some dank at this point so JA Girl decided she would help us out.  The Rat King came by, with his new girl, we'll call her Miss Kay, and we went and picked up a fat sack of dank, and promptly returned to my house.  I would like to point out at this time I didn't feel any pain of any kind, I was as normal as can be.  



We got to my house, where I keefed the bud we just got, and packed us all bongs with keef on top, which fucked us up pretty badly and hurt all our lungs pretty bad too. (for anyone who isn't familiar with keef, it's the crystals that you see on average to dank bud, it's collected on a sheet of glass from a keef box (box for harvesting keef), and these are placed on top of bud, with great results.)  After everyone besides Sir Dysentary left, I started having the pain again, and Sir Dysentary had to leave so that I could sleep, as I figured this would make it go away.  WRONG, I have had the pain for about a week now, and it's starting to get better, but who knows what damage I may have done\ldots  if any, but I wont go see a doctor, all they could do is prescribe pain killers or tell me I shouldn't have done what I did, I don't see them being able to correct it.
