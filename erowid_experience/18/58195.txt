I had been contemplating taking dimenhydrinate for the past while, just because I have easy access to it and it's cheap. My mom wasn't coming home after work and she wouldn't be home until pretty late, so I decided that last night was perfect, and I sort of wrote a log for the beginning, starting at 5:00 P.M.



T+00, 6 of them sitting in my stomach, for now.



T+06, I'm not sure if it's in my head but my vision feels blurry. I can't see them, but I sense black and white splotches fluttering in front of my eyes. My neck hurts and I stand up to see if I feel heavy yet, like I've heard. No, I feel quite normal.



T+15 and still nothing. I'm really contemplating taking more. There is a pain in my left arm that probably has nothing to do with the Gravol. I'm really not feeling anything out of the norm. I take two more, and head back to the closet and grab another two. I decide that if I'm going to do this I better do it all at once.



T+27, still nothing. I'm going to wait 15 and if still I feel nothing, I'm taking 6 more. 



T+34 now, and listening to Pink Floyd. I think I can feel something coming on, but again, it could just be my mind. I think I can feel myself getting more stupid, not to mention tired as hell.



T+44 and I think I feel it now.  When I close my eyes I see a lot of weirdness. Mostly pictures of things, except it's more like flashes in my mind instead of actual pictures. A lot of things I type are disorientated. I feel slightly heavy and a shadow kind of fades.



T+56, I decide to take 10 more and now I can feel it. I have cotton mouth and my hands are turning purple. I think it's real. I'm excited and anxious.



T+60, nothing has gotten any better or worse yet, although I feel really heavy and drunk, strange. I'm getting heavier and heavier, but not the way people describe it. It's just like pot, I get that weird sunken chest feeling and strong. I'm getting more frightened, what if I freak out? I can deal with it, I guess.



T+65, I just saw my first hallucination! Nothing big, but it was cool. The screen looked like the northern lights and spirals, and they were cool silvery colour, but still colour, and moving around. T makes little 3d shapes too, they pop out when I type. I hope my mom doesn't' come too early, I'll be a little funked.



I thought that nothing too interesting would happen so I closed the log. From here I just talked to my friend and told him what I was feeling. The rest is all until about 3 A.M. I saw more things on the screen, like the computer had intestines and a stomach, and I could see it breathing and moving. I would start typing things to my friend and suddenly forget what I was talking about mid-sentence. It became very difficult to read what he had said to me and figure out what I was going to say. I would remember then as soon as I went to type it, it would be gone again, or I would forget who wrote what in the conversation, and it became very frustrating. Often I would look away, and suddenly think I was somewhere completely different, like school, with totally different people. 



Everything I typed began to make little or no sense and my hands and arms and legs turned splotchy red and purple and brown and I was super shaky. I got gigantic blisters on my skin that were mostly gone the next day (I now know they weren't real, but even three days later I wasn't completely sure). I kept touching them and when they would pop I couldn't feel anything, but I saw sticky hair coming out, and when I looked at the hair on my arms it grew super fast, or sometimes it would get sucked into my skin. I could pull at the hair and some would come out but it was alive and super quick and it would stick itself back under my skin. I saw bugs of all sorts come out of my pores, and spiders kept falling on me. I don't mind bugs so I was mostly just confused, especially when a big white scorpion came through a small pore and didn't sting me when I touched it. I felt really disgusted and little frightened when giant centipedes started coming out, so I stopped picking at my skin.



I felt disappointed because for some reason I thought, ``I'm not even seeing hallucinations, this sucks,'' when really I just thought that normal things were happening. My legs looked like I weighed 20 pounds to me, and my mouth became very dry, and my throat very sore. I still was really, really loving it though, and I liked how it felt like a dream. My eyes became extremely unfocused and it hurt to look at things up close. Eventually I began to see detailed images on the blank screen, such as a mother with her child, then Joseph flicking baby Jesus in the forehead. If I concentrated on the screen for a while, I could make a Kleenex come out of it, or a laundry softener sheet. Usually when I tried to grab it, it would disappear, but sometimes I could gently feel it.



Suddenly my friends were in the room with me, but mostly talking to other people. They would be behind the computer and printer even though there's minimal space between the wall and computer. I thought I was going to burn out but I never did. I felt relaxed and comfortable the whole time, I never even got too heavy. I kept thinking my mom was home but I couldn't remember if I had actually seen her or not. I said things aloud like I was talking to people and then I would be embarrassed because they would all disappear, and the silence and emptiness felt extremely uncomfortable. I said something to the effect of, ``I also heard whispering coming from my left, it was creepy, like a demon hiding in the printer!'' 



I decided to go to bed because I thought nothing was happening still. I went to turn on the hallway light and as I felt around for it I could see someone standing in front of me, and I thought it was my mom, but for a split second before I turned it on I bolted upright in the air thinking it could be the devil but all that was there was a wall. I went into the kitchen to get a drink of water and for some reason my friend was there, but it didn't seem strange to me. He hid his head in the microwave and wouldn't look at me, and I thought it was because I wasn't wearing pants so I went to bed. It took a long while to fall asleep, and I woke up in about 15 minutes (I'm not actually sure if I really fell asleep). I had a terrifying hallucination that I thought was completely real even though it made no sense whatsoever.



This is what I wrote in my journal: 

``Okay, so it's the next day now. I probably had the most terrifying night of my life. I don't know all the details because I was sleeping when people decided it would be a good idea to break into my house. Not only that, but this idiotstick was threatening to rape me and shoot me and throw a bottle of champagne at me if [some random boy from school] shot the gun or something. Eventually [another random boy from school] convinced the guy to not rape me. Fuck. I don't really know, but waking up to a bunch of people invading your ROOM and hiding in the closet is not a pleasent thing, espeically when you're completely disorientated from the night before. I need [my best friend] to confirm exactly what happened, but there was dynomite or something in the corner of the room and it was scary. The raunchy kids had hidden a pound of Coke in my closet. Like wtf. So instead of freaking out that the police would take it, the guy was like, `it don't matter, it'll all be blown to pieces anyways', and I just froze. And cried, because it was terrifying. Also, I'd like to know why a cop didn't help us. Argh.'' 



I had typed that when I first woke up and I thought it made complete sense. It was scarier than I made it sound and it actually dragged on and on, not fun at all. I asked my mom some questions that I thought were perfectly reasonable and had to do with the hallucination but she gave me incredibly strange looks, and she looked like someone else when she was telling me to wake up. After my mom made me feel crazy and I realized that none of that had been real, I took a shower and thought I was completely back to normal. I shaved my legs while sitting in the shower and I saw all of my leg hair wriggling around on the ground and I felt it going into my skin like little parasites.



It was still in effect by 9 that morning, I saw a fire hydrant and thought it was a little boy in a parka, and a woman putting bags over the ground bent over to reveal that she was actually a rock. It wore off after that, but I was still a little stupid as the day went on. The most amazing part was the after-effects though. About two days later I began feeling a bit weird as I sat at the computer. When I looked around I saw flashes of things and I started feeling a bit anxious and I thought, ``I'm not on drugs right now, I don't want to see weird things''. I decided it was time to go to bed. I sat on my bed and the room began to breathe and shift and move. It was amazing.



I looked at the door and it was moving like something was trying to get in. ``It's the forces of evil,'' I thought, so I started moving my hands around and the room would move with me. I would rock back and forth and parts of the room would bloat and tip over. The door started shaking so I concentrated what I felt was divine energy into keeping it closed. A halo appeared over it and it kept shaking like the demon was determined to get in. I could see my camera bag out of the corner of my eye running around like it was scared so I told it not to be, that I would keep the evil out. My guitar had a face and I felt like it didn't believe me, so I used all my strength. Sometimes I felt the room start to settle down and the door become harder to keep closed, and I would realize I was feeling too powerful. Once I felt like I was balanced and equal with the room I had more mental strength and eventually the evil just stopped. I felt completely peaceful and everything felt harmonic. When I went to the bathroom and came back my room was amazingly comfortable and I felt the most calm I ever have in my life, and my sleep was incredible. I'm not sure exactly why this experience happened but it was great. Maybe smoking a bowl at lunchtime had something to do with it, I have no idea.



Overall, I loved it a lot. The only negative thing is I still felt like bugs were crawling out of my skin sometimes, or if I stared at my hair I could see it growing. In my hallucination someone had pointed a gun with a lazer site at me, and I saw blips of red light through the day and it was sort of frightening. I really think it was strange and kind of amazing, and despite the bad parts of the trip, I would definitely do it again.
