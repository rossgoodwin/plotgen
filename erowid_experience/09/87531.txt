Experience: I've really only had two trips, both of which were on 2C-E at 30mg and 15mg. I've smoked Salvia but I don't think that compares at all to either 2C-C or 2C-E.



Well yesterday I received the 2C-C from my vendor far earlier than I expected. He was originally going to ship it last Friday, and it would have been here by this Friday, but instead he wasn't able to ship it out until Monday. As a result, he put two-day rush shipping on it and added an extra 130mg to the original 250mg, as a compensation. I was originally going to dose 20mg 2C-E last night but because of the arrival of a new gift, I was obliged to test it out.



What follows is easily the best night of my life.



Note: I'm recalling this from memory. Today is the morning after this experience.



Set: Been pretty happy recently. Searching for jobs helps one feel like they're doing something with their life. Very, VERY excited to try the 2C-C though I'm a little worried because I'm in a house full of sleeping family.



Setting: Mom's house (dad passed away 4 years ago). My family is sleeping, and they're both very critical of drugs so I can't wake them up. Quiet, well-patrolled neighborhood too, so going outside for extended periods of time is not really an option. I'm in my room with a TV, window, brand new queen size bed, and plenty of snacks/water.



T-2:00: I measure out 50mg of 2C-C and mix it in a cup of water. I stir it a bit and it readily dissolves.



T-0:30: I take 50mg diphenhydramine (benadryl) for any nausea that may arise.



(Midnight) T-0:00: I drink the water and 2C-C. Strong bitter taste is apparent, will probably mix with some juice next time.



T+0:10: I go downstairs and get some BBQ Lays and a bowl. I always get something tasty and a bowl in case I puke. Bowl to catch it, food to clear the vile taste out of my mouth.



T+0:20: Already getting alerts. Slight cheek warmth, body stiffness, and some slight nausea/'stomach energy.'



T+0:30: First visual alerts already! Surfaces crawling, vision warping slightly. Losing full control of body and some sensation in body as I did on 2C-E. Defecating became difficult.



T+0:40: Visuals climbing rapidly, still some nausea. Starting to feel euphoric, anything tactile is awesome. Splashing water on my face in the bathroom is very enjoyable.



T+1:00: At this point I've just about peaked. I'm very surprised by the speed at which this developed. There's still some nausea, and it's still keeping me down. I feel if the nausea would just fade, I could blast off into pure unadulterated bliss.



T+1:30: At this point the nausea has faded, and I had felt like I had peaked. Tons of euphoria, waves of it flowing throughout my body. Music is godly.



T+2:00: I've peaked. I feel as if I'm hollow when I breathe. I feel so clean inside and everything is making me happy. The visuals are mindblowing, far far stronger than the 2C-E I've taken. Closing eyes makes me feel omnipotent but in a far more blissful sense than on the 15mg of 2C-E I had taken.



I'm basically switching from gleefully writhing around on my wonderfully comfy bed to playing audiosurf or watching music videos on my computer. Unfortunately I couldn't have my speakers on so I had to work with headsets.



I feel as if I'm floating. When I walk to the bathroom, I only feel my forward momentum, it's as if my legs are a separate machine.



Oh the tracers. I wave my hand in front of my face and it feels as if the FPS of the world just dropped. I see ghosts of my hand for a good 2 whole seconds.



T+2:30: I decide to go for a walk outside. I just can't resist it. The outside world just seems so magnificent but otherworldly. Once again I feel as if I could walk for miles. I reach the end of the block and it becomes overwhelming; I jog back home. I think I shed a few tears of happiness.



T+3:00: Visuals and euphoria starting to fade. Wow! This was a short trip. Mind you this is exactly what I needed, something so wonderful to pack into such a short amount of time is perfect because I don't have a busy day but there's never a point at which I'm alone long enough to be able to try most psychedelics. I get dressed (I was butt naked and writhing in bed for a while) and go downstairs. I flip on Pineapple Express and lay there (once again I can't really say I felt myself laying down. I felt as if I was floating, as if my body was a separate entity) waiting for it all to fade.



T+3:30: I heat up some garlic chicken from the day before. It's magically delicious! Still feeling some euphoria, and my vision seems `off' but I can't really define it. There are no more distortions or colors or anything, it just feels `off.'



T+4:00: I'm upstairs lying in bed and watching some cartoons for the ignorant bliss in them. All the euphoria and visuals are pretty much gone. Quite a short trip this was. I turn off the lights and fall asleep. There's still some familiar shaking that I experienced on 2C-E but nothing to keep me up.



Next morning: I feel tired, but that's probably just the lack of sleep. I was worried that life would seem shitty after that euphoria but I've almost forgotten what it feels like. Life is just normal again.



The pure bliss paired with the amazing sensuality and tactile glee and awesome visuals made this my favorite psychedelic so far (keep in mind I have very little psychedelic experience though). As for headspace, there was the basic looping of thoughts but that's it. The euphoria and visuals dominated the experience.
