It all started out with me being bored at night, and since I've been to psychiatrists through the ages and been prescribed pills of all sorts I decided to take a few down.  I took a few EFFEXOR, a few CYMBALTA, and a few PAXIL, all pretty much within the recomended dose range so no big deal.  But I had about 10-15 wellbutrin XR's and I decided to just eat them all, I had read that the experience wasn't fun, and I obviously should have way more research.



The whole thing was a blur and it lasted over 24 hours, and I'm still having some long term effects after (2) days which worries me greatly.  What the hell brain damage did I do here?  How is this possible with a drug people take 300+ mg (safely) of everyday for years?  Well it was an experience not pleasurable and not difficult.  Just an experience-- This experience could have something positive come out of it, or it might have killed braincells like a lawnmower.    



At a point in the session my knees started hurting and I actually couldn't stand.  And when I did stand I couldn't keep erect and had to fumble for the closest thing near me.  I thought balance had to do with your inner-ear?  How did wellbutrin do this?  I completely had no balance and was completely unable to walk without a ludicrous hand broom as a cane.  Other things totally gone out the window were Hand-Eye coordination.  When I took a drink of something, the glass would always touch the base of my chin or my nose.  I couldn't pinpoint where anything was- only while focusing directly at it could I pull of that monumental task.  So grabbing doorknobs and glasses I'd just be trying to pull at air for a few seconds until 3 seconds later I'd remember what I was trying to accomplish.   



Then there was just the pure stupidity and Supreme memory loss this drug made me feel.  I couldn't for the life of me follow any conversations, and when I did catch the end of a sentence I couldn't remember what the beggining was about-- then the whole topic at all--- even if I brought it up.  It went something like this: there was the main point, then me going into a tangent and losing the main point forever, then going into another tangent, then losing that tangent forever.  I had to ask my Parents (who eventually took me to the emergency room) what I was saying and what we were talking about many times.  I also couldn't talk for a reason.  My voice was a whisper.  



I was seeing more double vision than on any other drug I have ever been on.  It hurt to focus on one subject at hand.  And I would close my eyes for a bit and feel like I was in another reality- then open them and not realize what reality I was looking at.  Like Depersonalization from reality.  I want a lighter for my ciggarette.  I look for a lighter.  I instantly forget what I'm doing so I stumble around for whole minutes, finding strange other distractions that lead to other distractions etc.  Then I Finally have the breakthough that I was searching for `The lighter'!  Ah ha, and it could take literally 30 minutes of more of this `fun' to do and complete simple tasks like this because of the Intense memory retardation.  Which is absolutely Majestic.  Scary shit really\ldots  I hope this doesn't permanently effect my memory or cognitve skills.  



I can't believe the power of this drug-- and by power I mean, `brain Melting power'    I can see this experience being in the same category as Huffing Gas, or Huffing Glue.  Mostly Pointless, and absolutely dangerous.  I went to the hospital at hour +12, but there was not much they could do, as the activated charcoal phase had long come and gone.  And I absolutely did not want to get chained to the bed to await involuntary commitment to a psychiatric hospital.  But the staff seemed indifferent to my overdose.. Checked my vitals and let me go.  But I have been chained to the bed before at the same hospital\ldots  for just --talking-- about doing drugs with a counciler.  I was not high at the time, and away I went to the institution.  



My hand eye coordination is coming back-- albeilt slowly.  I have some hand tremors still\ldots  (they were awful) and my walking skills are improving.  I hope that nothing is permanent and this can all just be a memory and an absolute warning to be more careful with drugs.
