The first time I tried salvia divinorum was 3 days ago. A friend and I mixed some with some marijuana in a glass pipe, and I basically felt as though it were an enhancer to the marijuana. Strange visual\ldots contortions, I suppose, of the atmosphere around me. As though the air was bending. As soon as this happened, I began laughing uncontrollably. Keep in mind I was with 2 other people and a dog at this point. These were the only effects I experienced.



Roughly 2 hours later, alone in my bedroom, I decided to try it again, this time by myself. I had no pot, so I just loaded a pipe with only salvia d. during the second toke from the pipe, my vision became centered on one of the posters on my wall. I have a lot of posters, and before I really understood what was happening, the people on the posters began reaching out to me, repeatedly asking me `what is it?' other `beings' also materialized out of the clothes on my floor.  I could feel the hands on me, pulling and pushing at the same time, very gently. I remember saying, aloud, `this is fucked up. This isn't really happening.' Somewhere in the back of my mind I knew I had just smoked a mind-altering substance, and I thought I could snap myself out of it whenever I wanted. Which was now.  Shortly thereafter (I would guess the entire trip lasted less than 5 minutes, real time) I panicked, and tried to get out of my room, and away from the hands of the beings that had come to me, even though they were being very gentle. I managed to get back to my bed, find and chug a beer, and soon I was back in reality, though I was sweating profusely, and still quite shaken up.



The next night I had to work, from 4pm until 4am. I had been home for awhile, and at about 6am I decided to smoke some more salvia d. I felt a little more comfortable doing it, because I sort of knew what to expect (or so I thought). My roomate was watching me from the couch. I was sitting on the floor, and we were listening to music. I started tripping very hard on about the 2nd or 3rd hit I'd taken from the pipe. When I finally came to (about 3 minutes later, according to my roomate) the only thing I really remembered was what I can only describe as a train of light, speeding at me and directly into my face, with some sort of beings, whispering at me to come with them somewhere. I have no idea where they want me to go, and again I became nervous, and apprehensive about following them. I cannot remember what these beings looked like. I ended up snapping out of my trip quite abruptly when my roomate began screaming `this sucks!' apparently he was already in a bad mood, and watching me trip had really freaked him out. I came to reality with a jolt and knocked over the lamp that was behind me. In the morning (this morning) he told me was saying `some really crazy shit.' He said he couldn't even remember or repeat it, because it was so very bizarre. 



Tonight after work, I decided I was gonna try again, and this time I was going to go wherever the beings wanted me to go. I didn't have very much salvia left (it's expensive!), but I packed what I thought to be more than enough into the pipe. This is still very clear in my mind, as it happened less than one hour ago. As I was beginning my trip, I started to realize that I had gone thru the same initial hallucinations the night previous, but I had somehow blocked it out. The swirls of the glass pipe turned into a wheel of men spinning around, and I could hear the familiar whispers of these beings making plans, as though they had been waiting for me, and I finally had come back to them, and they were eager to take me in and nurture me, and care for me while I was visiting. They were very excited.



At about this time I started to think I was losing my mind. I was much more lucid than I ever had been when smoking salvia (in my 3-day career! ha), and I thought `well, let's see if I can get out of this on my own.' I began trying to shake away from this world I had entered, and the beings seemed a bit let down, but willing to let me make my own decisions. They were backing off, but I could tell they wanted me to come with them. I decided that I didn't want to leave them, but it seemed I couldn't go back without taking a couple more hits of salvia. I remember telling the beings that I wanted to come with them, and asking if I just needed to smoke more. They wanted me to come, but didn't pressure me. I tried to smoke more, but when I went to my supply, it was pretty much all gone. We sort of parted ways, quite unceremoniously. 



At this point, I began thinking of what had just happened to me. The fact that I remembered, now, that it had also happened pretty much the same way the night before, made me think. Am I communicating with spirits from another dimension? Have they been waiting for me all this time? I've always had very slight, uh\ldots psychic feelings. I don't know how else to say it, as I haven't really thought that much about it. My coworker, who says he is a pagan, and also has an affinity for salvia d., had asked me `did you ever wonder if maybe you were personally connected to the spirit world? And maybe you've found the key?' this really made me think. During the `afterglow' stage, as I've heard it called, I was becoming extremely paranoid that if I told anyone about this, they'd think I'd lost my mind. But at that point, I was SURE it was real. I also was afraid that if I told anyone, I may be shut off from the beings that wanted to take me in and nurture and teach me. I still feel very strange about this, and now that I'm sober, it all seems very ridiculous. But only because I want it to seem ridiculous, because the if I think too much about what might really be, I fear my head will explode, or implode. Whichever is worse. 



Basically, I'm just really wondering about a lot of things right now. It seems as though I'm no longer in the same mindset as I was before, and what I've typed out seems completely ludicrous. To sum it all up, though, I felt as though I was entering another\ldots layer, I suppose, and was about to finally be with these beings that have been waiting for me all my (23) years. I could hear whispered voices the entire time, and they reminded me of the voices I hear as I'm laying in bed, trying to fall asleep each night. Is that normal? Do other people hear them? I have random snippets of people talking in my head, and what they are saying is never related to anything else, so it doesn't really make sense.



I began to believe that I really was connected to the spirit world, and that I've come closer to actually BEING there than ever. I thought that I would forget what happened on the trip, because I had forgotten from the night before (or maybe it's in my head that it was the same? a deja vu-type experience?), but now I can remember. I was  very paranoid that if I told anyone about this, I'd not be let back in. I still feel as though I'm taking a chance of being ostracized from the `community' I really belong to, and that those beings who wished so much to care for me will no longer accept me. As I type and re-read this, it sounds completely insane. or schizophrenic. I really would like to talk about this with anyone who has had a similar experience. Then again, maybe it's all in my head, and I was simply tripping-the-frig-out?
