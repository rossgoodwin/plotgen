It was the day after my friends trip on some dramamine she had at a party, and she was telling me all about it. I was very interested in her story. After hearing about her story I really wanted to try it out. She had an extra 12 pills, and let me take them all. It was her impression that 12 pills of dramamine wouldn't do anything except make you lightheaded, but since that wasn't a sensation I was opposed to I took them. Her friend told her you had to take 24, which is how many she took.



Within 15 minutes I was feeling a thin pot buzz. During this buzz I was going to my friends house who lives in an apartment building where all the buildings share a large backyard. I was having trouble not studdering around 20-30 minutes after taking the pills. I was smoking cigarettes really frequently during this period too. Probably a cigarette every 15-20 minutes. That may have sped up the effects, I'm not sure. I was very cold, dunno if that was the actual temperature or the dramamine. After about 40 minutes I had my first hallucination. I was sitting on a chair with a blanket around me watching my friend play video games, and my other friend walked in and looked at me. Her face was sparkly. Her chakras were lighting up, and I was aware of some of her chakras, and could see how they were flowing.



Later, I went outside to have a cigarette, and sat on their lawn. It was kind of dark, a little before sunset in normal Seattle weather. Things were grey. Anyways, I noticed a large amount of kids running around everywhere, yelling as kids commonly do when at play. I knew they weren't really there, because of the way they were behaving and like, when they ran past a fence I only saw them through it sometimes. About an hour into it I kept thinking I had a cigarette in my hand. I had very frequent cigarette cravings, and once I wanted a cigarette I thought I had one, even though cigarettes aren't allowed in the house and I was under a blanket, I could FEEL the cigarette between my fingers, and would always forget that I had one in my hands. Also, I would constantly think I was at the first place I was at, my friend Jackie's house, where I popped the dramamine. Then I would go to ash my `cigarette' and realize when looking for the ashtray that I indeed was not at Jackie's.



Other hallucinations about an hour on into the trip included boiling grass (amazing to see), large (but not unpleasant) insects sitting on the top of the grass, tree's branches switching spots, shadows that looked like objects, and objects that looked like shadows, and a for sale sign in the backyard with a phone number and everything. When I was inside (much darker than outside) my hallucinations included the image on the screen vibrating (so I couldn't see it at all), the screen seeming three dimensional, and hearing people call my name. Also all the posters on the wall were behaving rather strangely. There would be lumps in them that would move from left to right extremely fast. And there would be about 3-4 at a time on each poster.



All of these hallucinations I've mentioned I knew were hallucinations. I was having a lot of fun, but wasn't talking much because it was really hard to talk without studdering. I was also talking really quietly. Sometimes I would catch myself with my mouth wide open, eyes wide open, staring at something, and then I would quickly move to normal position and pretend to be engrossed in the video game like everyone else was. Walking was extremely hard as well. It was like trying to walk in a straight line while spinning around in circles, except I wasn't spinning. In order to not fall over I had to grab on to something or someone, which was annoying because I didn't want one kid there to know that I was high as he would be worried about me and watching after me, and he had a hard day I wanted him to smoke his pot and play his video games and relax and not worry about anything.



Anyways, later on in the night I had some hallucinations I wasn't SURE were real or not, but I still knew I took dramamine and I still knew that it was possible that the things I was seeing were not real. These hallucinations included: Two teenage guys joining the group and snorting cocaine (they were never there, but I noticed they didn't talk to anyone except me so I figured they didn't exist. They disappeared eventually, they didn't last long), and those theft-proof stickers they put on cd's in the store were all over one of the walls. I know they weren't there, but wasn't positive at the time because I knew I would not make it to that wall without falling over or obviously being high. It was also kind of confusing, because in the house there were some strange things that I thought might have been hallucinations but actually weren't. Like this kid who's house I was at has this large wooden staff with a skull on top. And there were a bunch of colorful beer lids stuck to the ceiling. Both of these things were visible to sober humans.



My experience was very good, and I would not mind doing dramamine again. I would definitely not do anymore than 600 mg. Unfortunetly, I'm not sure at all how long the high lasted. I took the dramamine around 8-o-clock though, and I was very spacy the next morning.
