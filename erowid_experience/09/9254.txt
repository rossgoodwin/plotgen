I already came to the point where I doubted my ability to receive a hallucinogenic effect out of salvia, because I smoked it four or five times before today and nothing happened, I smoked less today compared to the last time I smoked before.  



To describe my state of mind before I took the salvia:  

1.) I realized that I had spent my life until today without doing anything useful. 

2.) I had quit the relationship with my girlfriend.  Ugly day\ldots  Mindbomb\ldots   



So I decided to seek `shelter' and spent my day with my best friend.  We know each other and we're doing our `drug testing' together. The  place couldn't be better, good music in the background ( Plaid ),  really comfortable leather couch, some drink in range, the perfect  setting, besides my real devastated mind, filled with bad emotions. I really wanted to feel bad, but salvia just sucked me  out of my body\ldots    Before the first salvia hit I had already smoked a good hit peace [Editor's note: don't know to what substance `peace' refers] and was already a little numb in the stomach. After I finished  complaining about nothing, my pal decided to do me some good and  prepared a 0.1g hit of 10xSalvia. I smoked it almost completely with  one turn and laid back after it. Another hit got prepared and I  smoked it also, just feeling the first tickles under my knees. After  the second hit I had to lay back must faster, more falling back than  moving normally.  The best way to describe what I felt was that I got sucked out of my  body. Like a large air vent behind my back or something. 



I mentioned  that it would be better to lie on the floor to enjoy the flight. I  spared some words to my friend that I will tell him later. But I hadn't  much time to think about this funny feeling because I came back  converted to some kind of lightwaves. After being sucked out I had  the feeling that I was separating or bending in salto-fashion and  transformed further into a flowing wheel of orange-green light pulsing to the beat of the music. That's next to what I felt most from all possible non-verbal expression, after all my english skills are lousy  too. I almost visualize music in my head in geometrical figure and  patterns, coloured somewhat between orange and green, some neon-like  colour. The figures and patterns are flowing and transforming according  to the flow of the music and the beat. On peace I can visualize this in  my mind pretty easy, but with the salvia I became a geometrical figure  myself, pulsing to the beat. 



I never had any halluzinogenic experience before and if this is it, I  will do it until I die of old age. After the first two or the three  minutes floating in some wave-shape through a dark mindscape glowing  in my own light, I realized that I was in a trip and I got the feeling  that I am able to control the trip. I recognized that I was opening my  eyes intuitively I forced them closed. And it work, I was  incredibly happy, Soon I started mentioning that the music will end after the song has ended and I began complaining silently, but the trip got me  back. The next two minutes I was fighting with myself not to let reality  back in my thoughts, because I don't wanted to loose this floating feeling. I worked quite good, but after this two minutes reality came back bit by  bit. It took some time for me to get the first words out and I fully  recognized that I had an awesome experience. A deep feeling of luckyness  and satisfaction filled my head and the only thing I could do was laugh  and smilr while trying to explain to my pal how great this trip was.  Soon after this I decided to let other people know what happened to me.
