Subject: 

Male, age 22, 65 kg, Western Europe, student



Substances:

bk-MDEA (Ethylone)		approx. 90 mg	

Methylone			approx. 80 mg	

2-CI				approx. 20 mg

MDMA (powder)		approx. 40 mg	

Isobutyl nitrate (poppers)	inhaled 4 times



Ingestion: 

All consumed orally in the course of four hours by taking on the tongue and swallowing with water. The main dose of 2-CI was rolled up in toilet paper and ingested. Less than 10 mg of MDMA was insufflated. Popper was inhaled, of course.



Duration:

Coming up: 2 hours, plateaus and peaks in the next 2.5 hours, long return to baseline in 4 to 5 hours.



Medications: 

Low dose of Claritin (anti-histamine). 

Five weeks off an SSRI, after halving doses several times over the course of several months. Currently on something herbal. Vegecaps with St. John's Wort, Siberian Ginseng, Gingko Biloba, Coleus Forskolii; vitamins B3, B6 and folic acid.



Preparations:

I drank several cups of tea with anti-oxidant properties and made sure to eat fruits. I had a light meal around 18.00. I did some cleaning, meditating, stretching and light physical exercise before taking a shower. 



Experience:

At 19.30 I ingested 50 mg of ethylone. 45 minutes later I still felt nothing so I took a 25 mg booster. I noticed a very slight change of perception but I doubted whether it was placebo or real. I tried to attain a breakthrough by inhaling some isobutyl nitrate but it did not seem to do much. During the wait I was at my computer, preparing a play list, surfing and chatting. 



30 minutes later my head was spinning a bit, breathing became more intense and I noticed a feeling around the very top of my head. Some call it the crown chakra or Sahasrara. This crown chakra feeling usually pairs with light euphoria that I can experience on other substances as well. Also, I had to burp lightly which is typical for these research chemicals. From there on I did not keep track of things that much anymore. I went into my other room to meditate and stretch. In the course of the next three hours I took booster doses of ethylone, and small doses of methylone and 2-CI at irregular intervals. Rather than taking them at once, I took them in 4 or 5 times, taking very small dabs of the powder on my tongue each time. A minor dose of MDMA was snorted, a dose of about 10 mg 2-CI was swallowed in toilet paper.



I had gone back to my computer. ``Uf dem Anger'' from Orff's ``Carmina Burana'' sounded celestial. Orbital, goa trance and other electronic music all passed by. I have a very broad taste in music and it all sounded good. After 11.30 I turned off my computer because I craved stimulation that was more natural. I stuck my head out the window to inhale the cool night air and to gaze at the stars. The 2-CI was now clearly the predominating substance.



First clearly distinguishable OEVs: I saw a breathing sky and crystalline webs forming, these looked like those ice crystals on windows. I also experienced double vision and fuzzy vision and I was unable to focus on objects. Later in the trip these latter three would become dominant features. I knew I had to be very careful moving about. 



I snuck outside to walk in the grass barefoot and to stare at the sky some more. It felt so good. There was slight paranoia when I thought someone inside had turned on the lights, but what I saw were the lights that I had turned on and that had been amplified as lights in general seemed brighter. At first I did not know how long I was out there. It turned out to be ten to fifteen minutes. Time seemed to be stretching. I went back in to wash my feet and watch some TV. I thought I saw very small bugs on the stone floor but I knew better. I looked again and they were gone. The pattern of the natural stone was still fascinating, though. 



After 01.00 I decided to live out the rest of my trip in my bed. I closed my eyes. CEVs looked a lot like psychedelic art. They were sometimes kaleidoscopic and spiraling but mostly symmetric, looking like glass-in-lead church windows. For brief moments I lost awareness of my body. Some time after the CEVs and OEVs had faded I was still awake. My body was tired and demanded sleep but my mind kept blabbing on. I was not able to sleep until 07.00.  I attribute this mostly to the ethylone.



Aftermath:

Upon coming down I took my herbal meds. Later that day I also took approx. 35 mg of Effexor, an SNRI. (Like I would take an SSRI after a night on MDMA, except I had no SSRIs around). Some hours later I was really talkative because of it so I knew it was working. The hangover was less significant than the one I would get from MDMA alone at a larger dose. I drank tea and ate some fruits just like the day before. It has been over a week now and I have not experienced an MDMA-type crash.



Reflections:

Mentioned dosages should not be taken as a norm. I admit I am a fool for eyeballing doses and not even using alternative weighing methods and this was the main reason I took very small doses at a time. It could be possible that my past and current medications slightly weakened my experiences. Maybe I should have gotten a xanax or something similar as well, to get myself to sleep sooner. Lastly, I could have used a vegecap instead of toilet paper.



Most of the revelations came in the comedown. I (re)learnt a lot about myself, my personality, but these revelations are personal so I am not mentioning them here.



I thank you for your time and attention and I hope this report will be useful to many.
