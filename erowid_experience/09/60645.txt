This is my full blown trip, with many hallucinations. This is the real deal.



Me and my 2 friends had been hoping that our guy would have ecstasy all week, but by Thursday, we were getting kinda annoying and wanted to experience something. Another friend tried to get us vicodin, but he was out of that too, so he recommended benadyrl. 



After school, we got on the bus and took it down to the local CVS and went in and bought 2 packets of 48 benadryl capsules. It was surprisingly easy actually, I was expecting to have to make up a story, but we got them, along with a couple powerades to wash it down. We started our mile walk home, talking about what we anticipated this to be like, all very excited. When we got to friend 1's house (3:30pm), his dad wasn't home and wasn't supposed to be until late so we all opened our packets and split it, 20 pills each (500 mg) and downed them all at once. We went into the other room and watched some TV.



Me and friend 1 had done ecstasy a couple times each before, but friend 2 had never had anything. In past times, mine has always been the one to kick in first, and sure enough it did. After about an hour (4:30) I suddenly felt a weird twitch in my fingers and suddenly felt happy. None of us knew what to expect from this new drug. They were all laughing at me trying to stand up, then losing my balance and falling over but I was still fully conscious and knew what was going on, but boy was I excited. Then I suddenly felt so unbelievably tired and almost fell out of my chair wanting to sleep so badly, but knowing I had to stay awake to experience this.



By now my friends were beginning to feel it too, and I had a slight headache, but was beginning to trip. One of the first things I did was going to the bathroom, which hurt very much for some reason, and was the first of many trips to the bathroom. Then I came out, starting to feel the full effects. I had the first hallucination. In my friends house, he has a picture of a dog and as I stared at it, it started to move, nothing really just like it was shaking and there were tons of weird lines around it that were kinda blurry. Then friend 1 said he could see the lines too, but allover the walls and on the computer screen.



They weren't feeling the full effects yet, and were trying to mess with me by throwing things at me which really freaked me out and knocked me over, even if it was just a piece of paper. For the first few hours I felt kinda hyper and couldn't stop walking around, kinda expecting this to be like e. One thing that was really starting to piss me off was that when ever I tried to read anything, my eyes would go cross-eyed, and I couldn't stop it. I couldn't read anything, not even the computer screen. I went into the kitchen and allover the fridge and on the dryer and washer I saw these little black bugs, more like tiny spots actually, but the guy that told us to take benadryl said I would probably see them.



After that I just remember sitting in a chair with my 2 friends around me, trying not to fall asleep, broken up by me going to the bathroom. The whole time we were sitting their, I seemed like I had been knocked out and I would suddenly jump up, not knowing if I had fallen asleep. What I think happened was I was in a state where I was so out of it, that I had my eyes open, but I was basically sleeping. While in that state, the tiniest sounds would set me off and I was told that every time anything made the smallest sound I would jump up and say `WHAT THE FUCK WHO DID THAT WHAT WAS THAT!?!?'



Then we all started to `wake up' and talk, and walk around a bit. It seems like what anyone said, would happen. Friend 2 was sitting in a chair still and was staring at a fake dog that was life size. He said, ``Look the dog is winking'' and sure enough, I looked at it and the dog was winking, right at me. We knew we were hallucinating and laughed a bit. Then we sat down again, TV off, but friend 1 was laughing and smiling at it and later told me that we were watching VH1, and I had to explain to him that the TV was off.



We were all fully conscious and gathered around the computer, when my mom called me! I'm not fully sure what I said, but I did say I was heading home. Walking, in the dark, alone. The first thing that happened, right as I walked out the door, is I saw three guys from my baseball team, playing lacrosse in the neighbors driveway. I didn't notice it wasn't real. Then, only like 20 feet later, I saw 2 people (girl and boy) holding hands and running up towards me. The guy stopped right in front of me and started to rub a tree. I was about to say, ``Dude are you high'' right when he disappeared. Then I got down to the road and luckily made it across even with it being rush hour traffic. I kept on walking on my journey home, still not noticing that I was actually hallucinating at most of the things I saw. I was walking down the sidewalk, and I kept forgetting what road I was on and kept thinking I had to turn around and go the other way.



After about 6 stops and 6 times I tried walking the other direction, I made it to the end and now I had to cross a large patch of grass. From one side of it, I saw two white Great Danes (not real) sitting right next to each other, starring at me. Oddly, I wasn't scared at all and just kept walking towards them. When I got within 5 feet of them they both scattered in separate directions and I kept walking. Now I am on a trail that I have walked millions of times. It's a paved walking trail that goes through the middle of the woods, over to my development where I live. After walking for a few minutes, I see three friends from school, a guy and 2 girls (not real). They all looked normal and the guy was listening to his iPod. I asked, ``Hey what are you listening to'' and it seemed like the sound of my own voice made them disappear. That time I noticed that that was a hallucination.



Now I had to cut off the path and walk straight into the woods. But right before I stepped off, I looked down the path and saw another couple, with a lot of clothing on, walking 2 German Shepards (not real). I walked into the woods, pitch black, and somehow made it across the stream, and to the other side-my back yard. I walked to the front door and as I started up the stairs, I notice my recycling bin was right their, and it was filled with wreaths (not real). I took no notice and walked up the stairs.



I got out my key and kept forgetting which one was to open the door, or even how to use them, so I just rang the doorbell and my brother came to let me in (7:00pm). I went up stairs to my room and unpacked my backpack, took off my jacket, ect. I came back down to go on the computer and even though my mom wasn't home yet, I kept thinking she was and I was trying to act as normal as possible. I went on AIM and started talking to friend 1. I tried to tell him about my hallucinations while I was walking home but I kept forgetting to tell him and decided to just go back upstairs.



I had to do a few chores like empty the garbage's and came back downstairs to get a garbage bag, but forgot what I came down for and went back upstairs. I went up and down trying to get a garbage bag like 4 times until finally I kept saying garbage bag out loud so I could get one. This thing of forgetting things was really getting on my nerves. I went back upstairs, into my mom's room to empty her garbage. It was dark. When I was filling the bag, I looked towards the doorway and saw another guy I knew from school (not real). I said ``What are you doing here'' and because he don't particularly like each other I walked up to him and pushed him into the wall, then he disappeared. I stood at the top of the stairs, garbage bag in one hand, and starred at the wall in front of me for several minutes. The little black bugs reappeared. I walked down to the garage and put the garbage in the bin and stuck it outside. Now I remembered that I had to bring the recycling in so I went to where I thought I saw it, but it wasn't their. I looked all around the street and still couldn't find it so I just went inside. By now its 8 pm and I'm on the verge of falling over from exhaustion. I went up to bed and fell asleep within 10 minutes.



The next morning I woke up to my alarm, 5:50 am, and shot up, still tired as hell even though I got almost 10 hours of sleep. I got ready and got in the car with my mom who I hadn't seen for the past 24 hours. I felt really shitty but I asked her where the recycling bin was and she said it was right in front of the garage. I asked her if she had thrown away any wreaths and she looked at me funny and said no. I was still somewhat under the influence and felt like I had a hang over, even though I had no alcohol the night before. I went to school and talked about the night before with friend 1 and the guys who suggested it. Friend 2 had skipped because he felt so bad. Now I was starting to realize that a lot of the things I saw the night before were not real. I didn't feel normal at all that day, I felt extremely tired and completely off track. I didn't start feeling myself again until about 4 pm. I recapped the last 24 hours and noticed that much of it was a blur. 



We all under estimated this drug BIG time, I think we should have tried 400mg instead. We've still got 36 pills left from the box of benadryl and me and friend 1 plan on using it up sometime soon when we will be safe.
