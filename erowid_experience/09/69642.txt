Regarding the little information on this new compound, I decided to search the internet for suppliers of Mephedrone and to undertake an experiment in the hope that my experience will help others to decide whether or not to further undertake experiments with this compound themselves. I quickly found two suppliers, and bought a gram sample from each so as to compare the substance, and report on any difference between the two - without performing a lab test I would say that the substance is the same, in terms of texture, colour, smell and form - the only main difference was in the price and the packaging. Before I carry on any further I will explain a little about my set and setting, along with my previous experiences with psychoactives. 



I'm currently 19 years old and in good mental and physical health. I've had previous experiences with the following substances:

Cannabis (daily smoker), Psilocybin mushrooms, LSD, MDxx, amphetamines, cocaine, ketamine, diazepam, akyl nitrate, solvents, opiates (poppy pod tea, codeine, dihydrocodeine, opium), BZP, MCPP, DXM, Diphenhydramine, Khat (Catha edulis), Kava (Piper methysticum), Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa), Yopo snuff (N. N-dimethyltryptamine, N-monomethyltryphmine, 5-methoxydimethyltryptamine, Bufotenine), wild opium (Lactuca virosa), will dagga (Leontus sp.), Salvia divinorum, Peyote - and some of the more `exotic' RC's like 2C-B, PMA, TMA, 4-MTA.



I have had at least one experience with each of the substances above, with some repeated more often than others -- but just because I've had experiments with a broad spectrum of psychoactives, I wouldn't say I'm totally experienced with all mentioned, although this gives me the opportunity to make fairly accurate comparisons. 



Today, on the day of the experiment, my set and setting are perfect. I'm sitting comfortably at home with no commitments all day. I consumed 4 units of alcohol yesterday and smoked a small amount of cannabis in the evening but I doubt this will affect my experiment as I'm well rested, fed and hydrated with a positive mindset. Although I feel a little apprehensive about taking a compound that is new to me, it's nothing that a little meditation and good music wont cure. I'm currently not taking any prescription medications, but take 1-2 tablets of St Johns Wort a day, and sometimes use valerian in the evenings to aid sleep. 



Substance details



Common/street name: Mephedrone

Chemical name: 2-Methylamino-1-p-tolylpropan-1-one HCL/4-Methylmethcathinone 

Physical state: Whitish/Light yellow powder, somewhat `bally' in composition, although breaks down to a fine powder

Odour: Strong chemical smell, was apparent even through the packaging. Reminiscent of stale urine, with an undertone of liquorice. Not pleasant.

Chemical stability: Stable at room temperatures, in closed containers under normal storage conditions. 

Molecular formula: C11H16NOC1

Molecular weight: 213.71

Dosage: Has been reported similar to MDMA, from around 50-200mg, but as it's a Research Chemical, there is no known safe dose. Start small.

Dangers: Toxicity in unknown. Powder is said to irritate eyes and lungs if introduced to those areas and ingestion may cause irritation to digestive tract. Dangers of chronic use is not yet known. 

Duration: somewhat shorter than MDMA. 



So the experiment begins:



15.30 -- Sitting alone watching TV. 50mg is carefully measured, crushed to a fine powder, and half (25mg) insufflated. Slight stinging in nose and smell is unpleasant, although not unbearable. 

15.35 -- A slight uplift in mood, perhaps the beginning of a feeling of being `wired', rate of heart elevated. Strong smelling and tasting drip down the back of throat. 

15.40 -- Another 25mg is snorted. Stinging is more pronounced this time, and with definite feelings of coming up, almost like MDMA but with less push, with soft euphoria.  Watching TV is entertaining but not as nice as staring out the window.

 15.48 -- Elevation of heartbeat is more pronounced now, and hands are slightly shaky, not unpleasantly so though. Soft euphoria seems to be growing somewhat along with a feeling of content. Feel totally alert and would be able to converse normally with parents at this stage if needs be. 

15.54 -- Drip tastes absolutely horrible! I think that next time I try this compound, I'll try an oral dose to bypass this nasty taste.



15.57 --A friend phones me up and we have a half hour conversation, talking flowed easily and although I feel slightly intoxicated it doesn't show in my voice or conversation. 

16.30 -- A 100mg is measured carefully, crushed and insufflated. Immediate effects are apparent, a clear headiness and slight `speedy' feeling. Nose hurts and smell is not pleasant. 

16.35 -- A rushing feeling and clear euphoria is felt, but not as pushed as MDMA, feels much softer and relaxed. Heartbeat is up and hands and feet become slightly clammy. Perhaps a slight pupil dilation but unsure, my extremities tingle slightly. This is a good amount to snort I think. 

I put on some music -- Nagual Sound Experiment, the album `Invisible Movements', it's a merge of  dub/2-step/grime with influences of drum and bass and a hint of psy. Perfect for this experience I think. 



16.42 -- Music appreciation is amazing, the sounds seem to resonate with a clarity and meaningfulness that I get with MDMA. I feel great even due to the fact that hands are slightly clammy and shaky and I'm sweating slightly (although I don't particularly feel my body temperature has risen that much). Cant stop moving to the music and have lost all interest in the TV now, my brain is just going too fast. I feel like snorting more, but the stinging hasn't stopped yet and feel I should wait longer. I've read peoples reports about how when snorting this substance, it becomes rather moorish -- I can see what they mean. The drip still tastes awful. 



17.11 -- Pupil dilation and slight jaw movement when talking, not as pronounced as jaw tension experienced with MDMA but almost like when on good cocaine. Just got back from helping my mum and dad load up the car with stuff for a charity event -- talking and acting normal wasn't even an issue and didn't have to hide my intoxication, although it did feel a bit uncomfortable all the same. Decide to measure another 100mg for insufflation. 



17.15 -- It feels as though I was peaking whilst helping out my parents. I believe when snorted, it has a quick onset but with effects wearing off just as quick.

17.17 -- Another 100mg in snorted, with immediate effects. This feels good, I'm sped up and clear headed with the same soft euphoria and a small amount of rushing. Perhaps I wasn't peaking whilst loading the car and the latest line has just topped me up. 

Music still sounds great although there's little visual effects apart from maybe a slight fuzziness when reading. The drip is even worse this time, having to constantly sip water to help. This feels just like coming up on MDMA, but with less jitteryness (I find that when consuming the first large dose of MDMA of the night, I experience a nervousness at around the 15-45min mark, and this is not apparent with Mephedrone). 



17.23 -- The euphoria is growing, along with the jaw tension. Nose stings less. Can't stop bobbing to the now immensely pleasurable music. 

17.24 -- Dad knocks on my door and lets me know he's popping out. I find it hard to conceal my intoxication and feel nervous, wishing him to leave quickly. I'm sure he's noticed my large pupils and unconcealed movement of my jaw but don't think he'll mention anything at a later date. D'oh!

17.29 -- I can't believe this stuff is legal. Can't hide my doped smile.

17.40 -- Listening to music and closing my eyes is very satisfying, and even with no CEV it still feels great. I just ground my teeth and they squeaked, not nice! My vision seems to be fuzzing a little more and have a slight sensitivity to light. Feels like I'm peaking on my last line, or the effects seem to be levelling out a little. On this note, I decide to consume a little ketamine, to see what dimension it adds to this kind of compound. 



17.48 -- Upon standing, to fetch my ketamine, I had a sudden head rush and fully realised how stimulated I feel, yet with a totally relaxed feeling at the same time. I know you may be thinking it seems impossible to feel both stimulated and relaxed at the same time but this is how I'm feeling. 

17.52 -- A small amount (around 30mg) of Ketamine HCL is snorted in the same nostril as the Mephedrone. For me, this amount is on the small side as I use ketamine frequently and have a tolerance, but decided to act with caution, as one should, when mixing RCs with other drugs. The interactions of RCs with other recreational drugs aren't well documented, therefore I recommend if you decide to mix, proceed with caution. Start small.   

17.58 -- The effects of the ketamine, even at such a small dose, has started to have an effect. This combo feels good. It brings the emotional depth to Mephedrone, which I found was missing. Music still sounds amazing, but now with the added K dimension, when laying back and closing eyes there seems to be added visual effects, slight patterning and organic forms - nothing geometric though. I think the bump of K increased the movement of my jaw little. 



18.06 -- Intense relaxation, think the effects of the Mephedrone is waning a little, although still feel nice.

18.17 -- Effects defiantly diminishing now, the comedown doesn't feel bad though, just a little `spacey'. Perhaps the downing effects of the small amount of ketamine had an adverse effect to the stimulating properties of the compound.

18.31 -- Friends phoned, and although I felt a little `wired' whilst talking, conversation was fine and managed to chat for a while. The comedown is less harsh than MDMA but much quicker. Head feels light and airy, jaw occasionally is tense, eyes are less dilated and the smell of the powder in my nose is all but gone. Music still sounds great. 

19.15 -- Total baseline, with residual fuzzy effects in my vision. What's suddenly become apparent to me, is the anorexic effects of this drug, because as soon as its effects wore off I became immediately hungry (I have not eaten since my late breakfast). Becoming hungry straight after the effects of MDMA would not happen with me. Even in the comedown I still felt clearheaded and alert, unlike its cousin MDMA.



In conclusion:

Its effects in me were similar to MDMA, clearer with less push, not as empathetic and shorter in duration, stimulating but at the same time with a sense of relaxation. I think this is an interesting new friend, but one which should obviously be treated with respect due to not a lot of information being know about its toxicity, OD dosages and damage of long term usage.  Its pleasant effects and short duration when snorted make it a candidate high up on the scale for regular abuse -- something, which due to its short history of use in human beings, can make it extremely dangerous. Always remember when trying a new drug, that there can no way be what is called `a safe dose'. Individuals do respond differently to psychoactives so caution should be taken, upping the smallest dose gradually. Do your research, tread carefully and have fun.
