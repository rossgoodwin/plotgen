A little background:



I'm a heavy drug user. I smoke marijuana daily, usually in excess. I am two weeks away from my 20th birthday. I am in college, and I do fairly well for myself maintaining a B- average, with an A- average in my major (government). While I am at school marijuana is a part of my social life, but I also believe that I am addicted to it. While I'm not at school, or have no responsibilities that I prioritize ahead of drug use (which include friends and family, sports, etc) I descend into very heavy marijuana use.



For example while on summer break, which I am right now, I've been staying up until 5 or 6 AM most nights, smoking pot the entire time. I am unemployed right now, but as soon as I obtain a job my lifestyle will mimic my school life much more; marijuana will be much more a social drug for me rather than such an individual one, like it is right now. I've been living like this for about four years now, since my junior year of high school.



I take no medications. For the most part I never try anything more than pot. I had my wisdom teeth out two years ago, and was prescribed Vicoprofen for the pain. I ended up taking a ton of it over the three weeks I was in bed; a serious infection in one of the teeth sockets kept me sick for much longer than is average for a wisdom tooth removal. Due to the length and intensity of use, I experiences serious withdrawl effects when I stopped taking it. Until tonight, that was the extent of my drug usage: lots of pot and this brief experience with vicoprofen.



Which brings us to now. I was out of marijuana, without money to buy more, and my mother had recent surgery which left a half filled bottle of 5mg hydrocodone tablets. They say ETH on one side, with the number 313 printed on the other. I stole three of them earlier in the day with the intention of taking them after she went to sleep. I don't know a lot about the pills other than what it says on the RX bottle, which reads 5mg hydrocodone. She is a relatively small lady, which may account for the low dosage.



In my bedroom, after she was asleep, I broke the first tablet up into halves, and crushed those halves into as fine a powder as possible. I had smoked the last of my marijuana earlier that day, just a few hits worth from a small bong. I had also smoked two cigarettes. 



1:00 AM: I blow half of the first pill. Total hydrocodone dose: 2.5MG



1:10 AM: I snort the other half, because I was feeling very little. Dose: 5MG



1:15 AM: I feel a warm, fuzzy feeling. My face feels noticeably warm. I am watching tv and chatting on AIM, nothing seems out of the ordinary.



1:30 AM: I am talking to a girl who I have a small crush on, a friend from school. I feel very good talking to her, which is normal. But it's a stronger feeling right now. I'm wondering if the drug has anything to do with this. I'm having no trouble putting together thoughts, and we are having a very good conversation. This makes me feel even better, slightly euphoric. I'm not sure if it is just the drug or the person.



1:50 AM: I crush up another of the pills and snort it all at once. 



1:55 AM: I feel very good. The second pill seems to have worked much faster than the first, probably since I did it all at once rather than half at a time.



2:20 AM: Still just watching tv. I don't feel anything out of the ordinary other than that warm feeling, and also a small sense of euphoria. It is at this point that I consider taking the third pill.



2:50 AM: Still feeling good, still a very mild feeling. Still considering taking the last pill. I am thirsty, so I drink a diet coke. It tastes great, better than usual (I love diet coke), although I think that that is psychosomatic if anything.



3:10 AM: I went downstairs to get another diet coke, I noticed my coordination is slightly off as well as my balance. However, if I concentrate just slightly, I can ignore the feeling and operate normally. The diet coke is still very good, but I don't think it's really being enhanced by the drug, as with marijuana.



3:19 AM: I've prepped the last pill by crushing it up. I still haven't decided to take it, but it seems that by my actions and thoughts, it's only a matter of time.



3:32 AM: I decided to go and smoke a cigarette instead of doing the last pill. I'm not a heavy cigarette smoker, usually 1 gives me enough of a buzz that it's almost more than I like. It's raining out. I smoked the first and took a small walk in the rain, it was a lot of fun. The moisture in the air made the cigarette smoke look very interesting. I decided to smoke another.



3:40 AM: I still feel good, but a little nauseated. My skin is clammy, and not entirely from the rain. I don't necessarily like how I feel right now. I'm going to lay down for a while.



4:00 AM: Just spent the last 20 minutes sitting on the bathroom floor. I went in because I thought I might throw up. I didn't, but the nausea has not stopped, nor has it gotten worse. I'm sweating fairly profusely from my face and neck. I checked my temperature three times to make sure I wasn't in worse shape than I felt. It was around 97 degrees each time, which is very normal for me. I am going to discontinue this experience report now. I do not feel very good and am simply going to wait out the high and then go to sleep.
