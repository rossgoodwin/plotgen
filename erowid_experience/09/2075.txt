Seeing as there were a few questions on Morning Glory seeds, and seeing As I *have* tried them, I thought I'd pass along some tips I've garnered on consuming them, as well as a description of the high. 



Earlier this year, I downloaded the `Natutal-High' FAQ. The description of Morning Glory seeds, as well as earlier discussion about them on the net (last year some people described their experiences with them) prompted me to take them. (I've never tried LSD, and the FAQ said that the seeds constained LSA, some sort of chemical cousin of LSD. This added further impetus to my desire to try them.)



Based on my own empirical testing of the commonly available MG seeds, the ones labeled `Heavenly Blue' are the ones you want. The other seed types seemed to have little physchoative affect. I purchased the seeds from two different companies Northrop King (NK), where the seed origin is Holland, and Olds, which grows their seed here in my hometown (Madison WI.). The easiest time to find MG seeds (or most other commonly sold seeds) is in the Spring, when they are sold at supermarkets, hardware stores, etc.



Play it safe. Before you consume the seeds, wash them. This is not to prevent nausea, because even untreated MG seeds are probably going to make you feel sick. The LSA, and the chemicals that make you feel sick are all there *because* the plant does not want you eating its seeds. Washing them removes any dirt and fungacides which may be on the seeds - things you probably don't want to eat. 



I used a strainer (the kind used for noodles) to clean the seeds. Place all the seeds in the strainer and run luke warm water over them for a minute or two. You might want to use a little dishwashing liquid too. After washing them, its time to consume them. The FAQ said LSA is water soluble, so ideally you would grind up the seeds (a pepper grinder works well) and soak them in water. Soak the seeds for an hour or two. Strain the water through a coffee filter and drink the blackish-green water. Alas, in my own experience (described below) the effect of the seeds is much stronger if you actually drink the ground up seeds with the water.



I've tried MG seeds on three occasions, all within a two week period a about a month ago. The first time a friend and I consumed five 1.5 gram packs between us. We ground up the seeds and put them in tea bags, which we soaked in hot water for about 10 minutes. After a few hours we both concluded that they had done little for us. We both just felt a liitle `weird' for a few hours. On the up side, neither of us felt sick after drinking our `tea'.



Being the stubborn person that I am (I am a programmer after all ;-) ) I was determined to see if there was anything to MG seeds. On the second occasion I consumed six 1.2 ounce packs of seeds. On this occasion I ground up the seeds and put soaked them in some water for about an hour. I then drank the entire mess. In anticipation of feeling sick, I hopped on my bicycle (it was a cold spring night) and rode around the city. I had been hoping that the bike riding would keep my mind off any sickness.



I started to feel sick after about half an hour. It started to get real bad (the nausea) after 45 minutes. I had brought some pot with me just in case, and after smoking a little almost all the nausea went away. Unfortunatley, I was now high, so I could't really observe the MG seeds as they came on :-). After about an hour I still felt nothing (besides being high) and concluded prematurely that the seeds had done nothing. However, As I was riding home, I began to feel *real* weird. My field of view seemed to expand, and the entire sky looked enourmous. The bike ride home was fantastic. I really can't explain the high -- I now understand why people say you can't describe LSD to people who have never used it. The affects wore off after about four hours, but I had a lot of trouble sleeping that night.



On the third occasion I was with my brother. This time I tried NINE 1.5 gram packs of ONLY heavenly blue seeds. Note that on the other two times I had mixed different types of seeds. My brother tried only other varieties of seeds. Again I ground up the seeds, soaked them in some water, and drank the entire mix. This was to be the start of a huge, often unenjoyable trip for me. My brother (who *has* tried acid) said that he felt very little (that's why I recommend the Heavenly Blue seeds), but that what he did feel was like the end of an acid trip.



About an hour after eating the seeds, I began to feel sick. (we ate the seeds at about eight at night). I would feel sick on and off during the entire trip until about six in the morning, when I finally blew chunks. This did not, however, end the trip.



The affects of the high/trip came on very gradually, over some hours. After staying with my brother for a few hours, I decided to try to bike home. This was something of a mistake. Riding home was difficult, as everything seemed strange and alien. I ride my bike a lot (I don't own a car) yet even my bike seemed foreign -- I had trouble telling where my body ended and the bike began. I also started experiencing visual hallucinations -- I saw red and green lights and my vision seemed soft and fuzzy. As cars passed by me, their headlights seemed to shine through the back of my head. I also started to get *real* paranoid and self-conscious.



When I got to my apartment, I saw that my roommate was still up. I was feeling so weird and paranoid that I felt I couldn't deal with talking to him. So I wandered around my neighborhood late at night on my bike, paranoid sick and tripping. That part was truly awfull. I began to worry that that the seeds had been treated with Mercury and that I had permanently lost my mind. After what seemed like days (actually only about an hour) I returned to my apartment, where to my relief I found my roommate had gone to bed. Feeling I might throwup, I went to the bathroom. In the mirror I noticed that my pupils were fully dialated, and I spent several hours looking at myself in the mirror. Near the end of this time the skin all over my body seemed to be moving and crawling as I looked at it. This scared me pretty bad, so I went to my room to try to sleep. (I still don't know whether or not my skin was actually crawling, but it sure looked like it.)



I couldn't sleep - my bed, the room, everything was wrong. Also, I kept seeing these strange lights - not really in the room, but more inside myself. Some of them were pretty ornate and seemed to be moving. This may sound cool, but it was *extremely* unpleasant. At that time I would have given anything to stop the experience and roll over and go to bed. Around 6:00 in the morning I finally hurled, but I still felt weird. The REALLY STUPID thing was that I did this during a weekday, and I had to go to work the next day. Not having slept at all, I went into work still feeling pretty shook up, but I made it through the day.



Overall it was a pretty nasty experience. I guess you'd say I had a bad trip. On the plus side, I did have a few interesting thoughts. The old philosophical mind/body problem seemed to become a non-problem. At one point while I was looking at myself in the mirror, and struggling with my nausea, the sick feeling suddenly became entirely a mental phenomena. I came to see my body as a mental thing, merely an extension or lower part of my entire being. This was something I actually experienced, not just an intellectual realization. So rather than having ones mind a product of the body/brain it seemed just the opposite to me.



Also, I found myself thinking about the quote from (I think) Socrates which goes something something like `All I know is that I know nothing'. I know this may sound sophomoric, but the truth of this statement dumb- founded me. All our knowledge of `things' or phenomena is ultimately relative, referring to other things or phenomena. Science is just a more rigorous way of classifying/observing/predicting things. But ultimately we remain completely stupid -- we can never know what something is. This seemed a fundamental truth, no matter how advanced we ever get technologically. The world seemed like a very crazy, random, chaotic place - like a giant zoo, with everybody living in it for completely different reasons. These thoughts really depressed me at the time.



Phew. Well, this has gotten long. In conclusion, I don't know if I'll ever try MG seeds again. The length of my last experience with them, plus the nausea and depression outweighed the positive aspects of it. If MG seeds are at all like LSD (which I haven't tried), its probably easier just to stick to acid. However, if you do try them, I'd recommend taking no more than six 1.5 gram packs of seeds.
