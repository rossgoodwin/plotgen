We decided to do Salvia in pairs of two in his room just so we could do it in complete silence. He had soft Trance/Fantasy music on. I went downstairs to play some pool. Down there I took a very small shot of Bacardi Lemon. I played pool for a while. Then my friend and I went upstairs to the room where the other two guys were having a session. I went in the room, sat down by a water bong, and my friend packed it very densely and blazed the Salvia. Without talking or thinking, I exhaled all the breath out of my body. I put my mouth to the top, and sucked hard and let go of the choke of the bong. I followed a procedure that I made. I sucked in deep and let it out my nose. Then, I sucked in the second time, and let it out through my nose, but this time, I let out less than what I took in. The third time, I sucked in hard occasionally letting go of the choke, and I exhaled a about 75\% of what I inhaled. I continued this until my lungs were fully occupied. Each time I would take in a 100\% and let out 75\% through my nose. This way, I still had 25\% in me every time. The 25\% gradually increased at each inhalation. Hence, at the end, my lungs were full and I would hold the smoke in for around 20 seconds and let it go slowly. This was the first set. I followed the same set of procedure three times=three sets. The last hit of the third set: I took it in deep and held the smoke in for about 20 seconds. When I let out the smoke, I just fell on my back and started laughing wildly. I felt so emotionally aroused. I could feel the tips of my fingers on my chest. They were unusually cold. 



Stage 1: I felt like I was dazed \& tipsy. I felt like I was in an earthquake because everything started to move \& shake. I was laughing so hard my friends pulled me up from the floor and layed me on the bed. I stared up at the glow-in-dark stars and I looked around the whole room like I was in heaven. I felt so emotionally stimulated it was unbelievable. 



Stage 2: I had no control ove my body or my thoughts. I heard everything but did not know how to respond. I merely gazed at my surroundings in awe. Then I started crying. Yes\ldots I started crying like a baby\ldots like `There was no tomorrow' as my friend later told me. I still do not know why exactly it is that I was crying so much. I had a wide mix of emotions. Happiness, Joy, Wonder, Fear, Anger, Empathy, and Sadness. I had no control over things I could normally control. 



Stage 3: I began to talk a little bit, but I was still halfway inside the vortex of this Salvia. I was sexually stimulated. I moved around, but I fiddled with things. I questioned everything, and I was paranoid. I looked around like a child and touched a lot of things. 



Stage 4: REALIZATION. I had gone to sleep, and woke up the next morning. I felt hazy and like I had been awake for a long long time. I could not recollect the wide range of emotions I had the previous night. I came home and started writing this. BAAM. It hit me. As I was writing this, I realized and understood what happened to me. I HAD FLASHED THROUGH MY WHOLE LIFE YESTERDAY. I RECREATED MY OWN LIFE. I was in awe in the first stage. This is when I was a very small child in the world. I just looked around. And in stage two, I was crying. `CRYING LIKE A BABY' because I was a baby. I felt all sorts of emotions, and did not know where to let them out and how to react/relate to them. Just like a baby who would not know how to deal with emotions. In stage 3, I began to talk just as a child would start talking after a certain age. I questioned things, fiddled with things, and became paranoid just as one would be when he/she is a child. I was sexually stimulated just as many teenagers. 



This was my trip to heaven and back. My friends told me a lot later that I had forgotten, and from that I could recollect what had happened. My entire life just flashed in my own self yesterday. During all of this I was only semi-conscious. My body was there, but my mind was in other realms. Salvia is like a boon of the gods. Its sacredness is not to be taken lightly.
