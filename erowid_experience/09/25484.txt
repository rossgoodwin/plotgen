Long Version (the short version is at the bottom): Starting about freshman year in highschool I became a huge Cradle of Filth fan and had heard various accounts of and references to absinthe in their songs, interviews, and so forth.  These sparked my initial curiosity, and this curiosity was increased when I heard that quite a few writers and artists had taken absinthe in their day.  In college I study math and physics, but in my free time am a writer of stories, most notably a rather long fantasy book I am writing that I doubt will ever be completed, much less published.  



Anyway, five years later, my freshman year in college, I was at a party when someone announced he had absinthe and wanted to know if anyone wanted to drink any with him.  I immediately volunteered myself and went off with him back to his dorm.  I don't remember which brand it was.  I do remember that I did not take it in the traditional way, but rather as simple shots.  He warned me it would taste somewhat unpleasant, but I didn't really care.  After the first shot I immediately felt warmth throughout my body and the flavor hadn't seemed so bad, just a bit bitter.  After the second shot, however, it suddenly tasted far worse -- it tasted like what Pinesol smells like is the closest description I can give.  



I thought I was going to throw up but after a minute or two of gagging I didn't.  Instead, about five minutes after taking the second shot, I felt the walls about me were throbbing in and out, squeasing my head.  Not unpleasantly, though.  It seemed almost comical, to be honest.  After that I had a bit of a conversation with someone I hadn't met before and the conversation, though it was essentially about nothing, seemed very interesting to me.  



A bit after that I went back to the party, the throbbing having had stopped and myself being convinced the absinthe experience was over.  Suddenly, though, the air around me felt more liquid than it usually does (ie, when not under the influence of any substance) and I enjoyed this sensation for about a minute or two.  This then ended and I primarily felt merely extremely drunk, so I sat for a while in the middle of the floor while people were walking and talking and dancing around me.  



Ten or so minutes later I left with my friend A. and we went back to his dorm, which was a suite which he shared with, among other people, a rather attractive girl.  On the way over there, I looked down at my feet as I was walking and though things didn't look very different, I felt as if I were towering above the ground, and yet ready to crash onto it.  I didn't mind this experience, and, like the throbbing, found it rather funny and amusing.  In his suite, I walked into a room and thought I saw an angel.  All the lights were yellower and brighter than usual and the room was just flooded with this light, with her glowing with a yellowish radiance.  I knelt down in front of her and started talking for a while, and then I realised it was the hot girl (mentioned above).  



After that the effects suddenly dropped off and I remained nothing more than extremely intoxicated the rest of the night.  I woke up the next morning with somewhat of a hangover but nothing more than the usual for a Saturday morning.  



Several weeks later, my friend S. was talking to me about my absinthe experience and how strange I was acting, and I was rather confused because I hadn't remembered him being there at any point that evening.  Apparently he had been there during the `angel experience.'  



Short version: not much of a hallucinogen, and in fact weaker in its effects than a very large, harsh dose of high-quality KB.  Made me feel rather happy, much the same as the initial effects of regular drinking, but lasted for much longer.  Very slight tactile and visual hallucinations, mostly just what was probably increased light sensitivity and slightly sensitised skin.   All in all, the Green Faerie is quite fun.
