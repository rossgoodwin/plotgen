After acquiring a partially used patch (100ug/hr) I can report the following observations: 



(\#1) Placing a patch on my back, no noticeable effects for about 14-20 hours!  No overwhelming euphoria (I was expecting more) just a general decent sense of well-being and good mood.  This is one powerful analgesic though; I noticed that normally painful stimuli were barely perceptible!  I was careful not to heat the patch, in any way, too much above body temp.  While showering, I kept the patch away from the hot water stream as much as possible.



(\#2) Using 20-40ug from another patch, I took a blob of gel, about the size of a head of a pin, and placed it on tinfoil, heated and inhaled the vapors.  Most interesting, were the `little pops' dancing around my brain (chemical binding and activating mu opioid receptors--or a decent illusion of this). 



(\#3) Roughly 50-100ug removed from patch and dissolved in saline to dilute the concentration.  Placed dropwise on a cotton ball and tucked between cheek and gum.  Slight opiate buzz within 3 minutes.  Re-dosing doesn't increase euphoria, just increases sedation.  Again, no real high to speak of, but I was quite insensitive to sharp pain.  Oral use also causes darkening of urine.  Either due to forgetting to drink enough water (increased concentration of urine) or some other process.  Some forums suggest that the gel used in the patches is really bad for the liver when eaten (more so than the fentanyl itself?).



(\#4) Pinhead sized-blob of gel (60-100ug?) rubbed behind ears.  The idea behind this being that the skin behind the ears is thin and the chemicals should find their way to the bloodstream quicker.  I did not use two blobs of this size, just one, rubbed between two fingers, and then each finger applied gel to skin.  No noticeable effect until 4 hours later.  The results were the best so far, but the level of sedation was a little much.  I slept well and deep, but I could not find that happy opiate warmth associated with fentanyl's cousins.



(\#5) Another blob, about the size of a grain of rice, was allowed to dry on a mirror.  Resulting film was scraped and chopped in preparation for insufflation.  This method was similar in effects to (\#3).



Overall assessment: Fentanyl is one hell of a pain killer.  It is designed to lock onto mu receptors and it does this quite well.  It is so powerful, it seems to me, that it blots out its own euphoric effect!  I am afraid that people may increase the dose to dangerous levels seeking that euphoria, not realising that they are already well dosed.  I can say with all honesty, that even when I did not feel any effects from fentanyl, I was oblivious to most pain.



An IM injection (not fentanyl) caused absolutely no pain when the needle entering my skin and muscle.  As far as euphoria is concerned, I get a greater buzz from 30-60mg of codeine taken orally than any method of fentanyl administration mentioned above.  That warm internal hug that are the hallmarks of ingested codeine and morphine were just plan absent with fentanyl.  If codeine is the `beer' of opiates, then fentanyl is the equivalent of 200 proof grain alcohol.  I doubt that I will explore fentanyl any further.  Considering that even little mistakes with this drug have killed people, the `high' just isn't worth the risk.  I am comforted, however, by the fact that if I'm ever in severe pain, this drug is available and extremely effective.
