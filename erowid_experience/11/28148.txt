I have been fascinated with the psychedelic realm forever as well as with trying new psychedelics. I keep myself as updated as I can pertaining to all the different psychedelics not alot of people know about. I've done my share of LSA, LSD, shrooms, salvia, sceletium(narcotic, not psychedelic), and lots of other uncommons. Yopo would be my latest exploration, and it turned out fairly enjoyable as a `mild' psychedelic. 



I ordered an ounce of the colubrina beans and did my research on the substance while I waited for the package to arrive. I memorized a recipe for `yopo snuff' off the internet. The yopo contains, from what I have read, DMT and 5-meo-dmt, and the only way for the DMT to be nasally active is to make the snuff with limestone paste powder. So I bought 40 pounds of dolomite lime, the smallest bag of the finest ground they had which was only \$3. When the package came I held off until the following week, then I decided to go make up my batch over at a friend's house. I took my coffee grinder with me as well. I got there and got right to business. I heated the beans over low on the stove and they started popping like 15 minutes later, they weren't exploding, they were inflating with a popcorn-like `pop!' after probably about half of them had popped, I turned the stove off and threw the beans through the coffee grinder and triturated the hell out of them. Then I poured the powdered beans on a plate and sprinkeled limestone all over the top, kind of eyeing out a ratio of 1 part lime to 4 parts bean. Then I threw it through the coffee grinder one more time to ensure uniformity and absence of any chunks then I was ready.



I dimmed the lights and turned the TV off and smoked a bowl for preparation even though it's known that MJ clouds the DMT effects. I took one line, about 1/10 gram, to inroduce myself. About 3 minutes later I experienced a mild uplifting of spirits and a slight enhancement of vision with a small giddy feeling due to the fact that the stuff turned out to be the opposite of `bunk'. Then I got excited. I new the drug had potential and now I was ready to go for the gold. I busted out the remains of a gram into about 9 other lines and continued to insufflate them all. I put a second or two between lines to knock back the substance with a drop of water to ensure that the stuff was being effectively dissolved up there where it's supposed to be. I noticed the drug was `much' stronger when I took a line as hard as I could, inhaled as fast and hard as I could instead being hesitant and careful not to hurt my nose. I noticed the more pain there was, the higher I got. 



Halfway through the lines I was overly excited, happy as hell, warm, tingly, a mild internal vibration was pleasing me, my vision was vivid as hell, colors stood out so brightly and conture detail on every surface was magnified and clarity prevailed. I was high on yet another new psychedelic and I had a whole ounce and a half of the stuff to explore with! I proceeded to snort the rest of the stuff, enjoying the weightlessness that was brought upon me, allowing a tear to escape my eyes when a good song came on, I was dancing and singing and laughing and I was all by myself. Wondeful stuff, definitely a smart plant teacher. I am now more than just a little curious about the DMT smokable extract. The yopo dripping down into my stomach after snorting it was nauseating by the way, and at two other given times, a friend threw up because of it, but I haven't yet. This would be something I would be infatuated with eventually trying with mushrooms. Oh yea\ldots
