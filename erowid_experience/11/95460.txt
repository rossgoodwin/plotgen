Didn't really expect to take 4-HO-MET the night I did, but a good situation came up and I figured it would be a good time to try it.



I'm not exactly sure on the dosage, my scales a little iffy. It could have been anywhere between 18mg and 10mg.  Well, here it goes.



9:30 PM: Arrive at house party.  Meet up with a few people, enjoy a beer and a mixer.  I mixed a gatorade with about tequila and vodka, enough to get me a bit more than just `tipsy'.



11:15 PM:  We leave the party, it's starting to get huge and might get busted soon.  I originally drove to the party but passed off my keys to a friend who only smoked a little weed.



11:30 PM:  Get back to friends place, figure why not test our 4-HO-MET. There's 4 of us, and since I was the one who bought it I figured I'd take the biggest dose measuered out.  I hand them all 9-11mg pills, and I take the 14mg baggy (I ran out of pill caps, so I just poured it into a baggy with powdered suger).  I down what's in the baggy, making sure I get it all by mixing it with water and drinking it.  One of my friends takes a pill, and the other 2 wait to see what effects are shown first.



11:40 PM: I'm starting to feel it.  Colors are starting to intensify and the ground appears to be `bubbled'.  I feel nausious and sit down.



11:45 PM: Oh boy.  I think I might have overdosed.  I start to freak out when it gets kind of heavy to breathe.  I warn my friends of this, and I attempt to purge my system by puking unsuccessfully.  I just want to go to bed and not be drunk/high anymore.  I put on my music and hope for the best.



11:55 PM: It's only been 25 minutes? Holy hell. My friend who took the pill still isn't feeling anything, although he is a bit high from the weed.



12:05 AM: I'm starting to see a lot of visuals.  I'm not nausious anymore at all.  I tell my 3rd friend this and he takes his cap.  We go on facebook and talk to a girl.  I don't remember any of this, I'm too busy lying on the seemed-to-be comfortable cement floor, laughing my ass off at a can of peace tea.  



12:1? AM: My friends start to feel the MET.  We go into the bedroom, where my friend has a blacklight and glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling.  Woo-hoo!



12:20 AM: We convince my 4th friend to take his pill.  The shapes of the stars can't keep a constant size.  The blacklight is amazing.  Regular light seeping into the room appears orange, beautiful.



12:40 AM: I am in complete and utter awe.  I'm amazed at my body features.  I've been laughing so hard and been in so much awe that tears have started to form.  For some reason I rub them all around my face and exclaim about all the fluids falling out of my eyes.  I feel my teeth and start making out with my fingers.  The shirt I was wearing that was a size too small felt like it couldn't contain me.  The plain white towel hangning on the door looked as though Yoshi was printed on it.  I walked up to the Soviet flag hanging on the wall and entered the USSR, while my friends explored the galaxy.



12:50 AM: Effects still going strong.  It feels like it's been days since I washed down the metocin.  Parents are upstairs asleep, so we have to contain our laughter.



1:30 AM: Start feel tired, but how could I ever sleep on this awesome drug.  I don't feel a bit drunk anymore.



2:30 AM: I'm starting to come down.  I go to the bathroom, which has wooden panels for walls.  In one of the knots, I see a dwarf with a long nose.  He winks at me and I continue to piss.  I look in the mirror and I look like starecat.  My pupils are dilated beyond belief.



3:30 AM: Visuals are gone.  Friends coming down, I'm left with a mental high feeling, like weed.  Friends are down in a matter of minutes, we decide to go to bed.



4:00 AM: Can't sleep, so we talk a bit.



5:00 AM: Finally catch some sleep.



5:50 AM: Friend \#4 (took it last) finally falls asleep.



11:00 AM:  My God, I look like a train wreck.  I slept in my contacts, eyes deprived of fluids and feel sticky.  Don't know how I'll go home looking like this.



12:30 PM:  Drive home, pupils are small now, eyes a bit better.  Mom asks if I'm really hungover, I play it off all cool and just say I slept in my contacts.  Whew.



1:30 PM: Still really tired. Go take a nap.



4:00 PM: Get up for a bit, well rested.  Finish the day relaxing.



Well, that was the extent of my trip.  Hopefully next time we'll do it during the day, and now I know not to mix tryptamines with alcohol.  I regret doing that, feels like I could have had way more out of it.  Next trip we'll do it in a light, relaxing room, maybe outside, and enjoy the trip to its full extent.
