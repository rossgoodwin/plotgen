Hey, so I just tried DMT for the first time yesterday and it was quite an experience and thought I should post here. 



I love hallucinogens and have done everything I could get my hands on. When I heard a radio clip of Joe Rogan talking about his experience I knew I had to try it. Unfortunately it is extremely hard to find so I decided to make it myself. I used a combination of the Marsifold tek and QT's tek to extract DMT crystals from some Mimosa Hostilis rootbark, I didn't do a final wash of the product because it was said to be unnecessary however as a result I am unsure of the purity of the product and therefore dosage info. I smoked it 3 times only being successful the third time so Here it goes.



----FIRST TIME----



So I just got my crystals and couldn't be more excited and nervous to try DMT for the first time. I had read articles about the proper way to smoke it because it's supposed to be somewhat tricky. So I went to a head shop and bought a glass oil pipe so I could do it without putting it on top of some pot and have a true DMT experience. I put in a clump of DMT the size of a pea, I made myself comfortable sitting on my bed and setup a video camera to tape my reaction and tried to work up the balls to smoke this stuff I made in my kitchen hoping nothing bad would happen. My heart was beating so fast and I could barely hold the pipe without shaking it I was so nervous. I hadn't smoked from a oil pipe for a while so I had forgot how difficult it was, I took two crappy hits and realized I had taken too long. I messed up and got a very weak disorientation, I felt sleepy and stoned. Colors were enhanced and exaggerated but overall really not a DMT trip.



----SECOND TIME----



So I messed up the first time and wasted some crystals, I hit the message boards and read that many people were more successful smoking DMT on top of pot in a regular pipe using indirect flame. I built a multilayered marijuana, hash, DMT parfait. This time (still very nervous) I tried to smoke it all in three hits holding each one for 10 seconds each. Again on my bed, again using only about the size of a pea. In my hasty lighting I believe I burned up too much of the DMT because what I experienced was an effect like a moderate dose of salvia, objects blending into each other, moving patterns, cool but not what I've read DMT is like. I was beginning to think that my crystals were less potent due to my extraction method so the next time I was going to really load it up. An hour later\ldots 



----THIRD TIME---



This time I was less nervous and more determined. I chose to try the glass oil pipe again an put a lot, about 1/8 of a gram an waited for the vapor to be really thick I began taking huge rips. It tasted like weird synthetic chemicals like I had read and it was quite harsh but I was on a mission I took about 4 short but deep breath and all of a sudden I felt my vision begin tunnel getting darker in my peripherals, my body felt heavy as if underwater. I knew I had gotten a decent dose and thought it best to put down the pipe in case I accidently spilt hot liquid DMT on myself. I set down the pipe laid back and closed my eyes.



I began seeing fast moving patterns that transformed into clear but rapidly changing pictures, birthday cakes, shapes, silly faces, changing as soon as I could recognize them. Like a flipbook where every page is different. The picture were all ridiculously silly and random all of a sudden I look away from these pictures which had been my focal point and notice I'm in some large white room and the humorous changing pictures are everywhere. I look around and it's as if every funny sight, sound, and word I had ever experienced was all around me.



Once I realize that this new bizarre dimension is safe and silly I begin involuntarily moving through the room. It was as if I was on a ride moving through a funhouse, because as I moved I saw that it wasn't a room, but rather a large multifaceted prism I was in, with colors and shapes moving all around me. While navigating around corners and through strange trapdoors I hear laughter, and fart noises, and hannah barbara sound effects and the insanity of it all makes me laugh, and all of a sudden I am aware of my body and the ride ends with my consciousness being dumped back into my body. The trip lasted approximately 6 minutes and I would describe the overall trip as ride through an elf's workshop inside a living kaleidoscope.



After the peak I was still feeling the effects of the DMT. I first realized my mouth and throat burned badly I drank some water but it only helped a little, I thought I had poured the boiling DMT down my throat and was seriously hurt but I knew I was still too wacked out to do anything about it. My room was alive with color and shadows I experienced interesting visuals when I would try and make sense of my surroundings. For example I looked at my bicycle which was by my front door and it would change in the same rapid flipbook style into other versions of bikes right before my eyes. Like a computer cycling though hundreds of pictures so there was a yellow bike, a tricycle, a streetbike, blue bike, small, motorized, everything. I would look at a clock, it would be neon, digital, a coo coo clock, all constantly changing. I decided I should watch the tape of me to see if I burned myself. I fumbled with the buttons and kept drinking water. Eventually my mouth felt better and I sobered up enough to watch the tape and see I didn't burn myself and it was just really harsh smoke.



Overall I think I've found a good smoking method and plan to keep hitting the pipe until I am unable to next time rather than setting it down prematurely. I hope to see some deep mystical shit with other intelligences even though the silliness of the `funhouse' was amusing.
