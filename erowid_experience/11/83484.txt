I have experienced Alcohol, cannabis, ecstasy, piperazines, mephedrone, temazepam, beta-blockers, salvia 20X, nutmeg, cocaine, speed, and possibly others I can't recall. No experience of lsd unfortunately, so I can't compare them.



I had an experience with morning glory just the Friday gone by, this my my experience: 



I had been reading up on morning glory seeds online for about 3 days before Friday night, on the second night I ordered 25g of seeds which I read was about 750 seeds. The seeds arrived on the Thursday. They were organic.



Preparation : All seeds were grounded in a pepper grinder and wrapped up unevenly into about 30 cigarette papers. I did not separate the shell from the inside.



Setting : I had a day off from college on Friday and did not eat for around 12 hours before consumption (the night before). I knew my father was in the house but would not intrude in my room. I did not know what else would be on the agenda for the day. I had two friends with me which I shall refer to as 1 and 2. 1 is my age, 2 is 20 years old. 1 and 2 arrived at my house around 12 noon. 12 noon will now be referred to as T 0.00.



T + 0.30 After greetings and chats 1, 2 and I started to swallow the parachutes with water. 3 each to start with.



T + 1.00 Mild nausea among 1 and I. 1 had not read into morning glory so did not expect this, he was also not expecting to try it that day, 1 has however tried lsd. We were watching national geographic types of programs, animals fighting etc.



T + 1.30 I had more nausea and went downstairs to the bathroom to be sick, horrid dry retch, cigarette paper and water basically. Though I was nauseous I felt some euphoria and a certain well-being.



T + 2.00 After being sick I brought my 8 month kitten up to my room. The 3 of us enjoyed playing with the cat and listening to music, gradually eating more parachutes and feeling energized. I felt no nausea any more, just euphoria, I was expecting a sudden out-of-it trip, but related this to the onset of amphetamine.



T + 3.00 Time was slow, it felt like a lot longer than it had been. Still playing with the cat, eating more parachutes and smoking occasional cigarettes. I pulled out the mephedrone and methylone which was recently bought for my birthday event the next day. 2 and I snorted a line each, mixed methylone and mephedrone. This added more buzz buzz, and I found myself dancing and waving cigarettes to watch the smoke. When I moved the ciggy to my mouth I felt a strange sensation and noticed as if for the first time that my face was the center of my vision, watching myself put the ciggy in my mouth and out felt strange, with a euphoric hint, well being.



T + 3.20 I was asked by 2 to read my short story for English class. It was on Microsoft Word. As I got to reading about the 3rd line, I noticed the letters were expanding, and distorting as I read, all the icons were the same. A rainbow trail was left after each word, I could not pay attention to the story anymore. 1 could see this also upon inspection, 2 could not. 



T + 4.00 Everything certainly has a glow to it now, much like smoking cannabis, I noticed everything was more shiny and intense. Touching my body felt very nice, music flowed with everything, and the energy was still coming, I felt like I had eaten more parachutes than 1 \& 2.



T+5.00 It was around this time things started to get more like I had expected, but of course completely different from anything thought possible. I had eaten about 11 grams of morning glory seeds, 1 \& 2 had shared the rest. I was moving around strangely feeling strange sensations in my body, very sensitive, my heart was racing and sensed anxiety which never came. More mephedrone, small line each again. 2 was still not feeling much, or he denied doing so. 1 and I could see he wasn't on the same level, I think that 2 was holding it back somehow. 2 could feel the mephedrone however.



T + 5.10 Typing what I was feeling to my friend on msn. As the writing moved to the right as I typed, so did the laptop and the world around me. I had an idea to put this on strobe along with imagination and fractal flash browser programs. I thought this would start some visuals by stimulating them, a kick start maybe. The strobe creates visual distortion for a few seconds when stared into for 20 seconds or so. I was right about my idea, after watching the fractals on that website, 1 was walking about looking at the walls and the carpet. At one point I said `You know this stuff my working when you see the full carpet becoming a fractal'. I looked at the carpet for 10 seconds or so, then I seen them swirling and expanding, the whole floor turned into like a bathroom floor design, but the floor was like an LCD screen. 1 and I could see these on the walls and flat surfaces everywhere. 2 was still struggling until he looked at the carpet for long enough and claimed to see them. 2 had the idea to go out, he called people arranging a bag of cannabis and 2 litres of cider all round (10 units).



T + 5.48 Another line of mephedrone/methylone and we left the house, I felt unsure I had everything, feeling I may be too disconnected for the outside world. Euphoria and bright vibrant everything, and patterns emerging from almost everything. It was dark outside and Alice and wonderland thoughts started to appear in my head. Cobwebs of ideas at every new sensation or thought. we got to the shop to buy lolly pops and sweets as 2 said LSD was very good for mouth sensations (more on that later on). I couldn't normally associate with the people in the shop, I felt awkward at the counter and on-edge. We must look like trippers I thought. we had massive pupils. Getting to the train right on time, I sat down and looked in the window seeing myself, realizing I had mdse face, I couldn't help my expression and looked like a 7 year old child. The patterns on the chairs were dancing about frantically, 1 could see the same thing. The thought of the cannabis made me slightly scared, I have experienced anxiety and the fear with weed before and wondered what this would be like, was it for best or worse? I had not experienced psychedelic thought like this before, basically a cobweb of ideas was forming that would get thicker throughout the night.



T + 6.30 The plan was to go to a friend's house and smoke weed in his room. That backfired and we was clueless, another group of friends were also getting some cannabis off the same person, the 2 groups decided to meet up outside at the drop off point. At this point before the meet, walls, bricks, buildings, road and pavement had unlimited patterns forming on them, rainbow coloured church windows/fancy wallpaper abstract designs. I was beginning to understand the meaning of the word `trip'. It was not like it is made out through media and it can not be properly put into words, but basically slowly everything, the current life story turns into something else, that circus theme tune comes on and everything changes, it's not out of ordinary though, it's reality but different. The cobweb takes over and leaves less and less spaces as it goes on. The groups met and I became anxious about the fact I would have to communicate with people I did not know as well has 1 \& 2, including one person I had never met. They were not on the same level, they were sober and far less experienced in drugs. They would say we were `tripping' but I new that they couldn't even use that word with meaning until they knew what I was going through. 



T + 7.30 The larger group, now made of myself and 7 others, went to roll a couple of joints. We smoked under a train bridge. The first draw felt like Deja Vu, the taste I knew, but cannabis was different now. It intensified everything. I could talk normally, but not to the new group, they seemed like bizarre entities, conversation was too simple with them. we realized they could go to another friend's house and smoke cannabis in his room. Weed had intensified everything and made me introverted until the later alcohol and more weed. On the walk to the friend's house, we encountered a lone police man who came up and asked where the party was at, we were petrified. I could sense searches coming all round. But it turned out the policeman was actually just having a chat with the group, then left. My eyes were now red and pupils massive, the policeman had looked at me. Further on the walk we went into a shop, 1 who earlier mentioned gobstoppers and fizzy sweets to be a good experience on LSD, bought some of these and gave some to 2 and I. The start was fairly normal, tastes were better. Further on the walk my introversion was still going, though I accepted the introversion as being normal, I have always been shy like this in some situations, large groups. 



T + 8.30 Still walking with this gobstopper in my mouth, it had split in 2 to reveal a sour powder inside. The cobweb of ideas started to become bigger, and after a while I had sudden revelation. I do not remember what thoughts led to this revelation, but I started to realize myself as part of the world, a spectrum of life, every form of life connected in consciousness, some sense of connection and wanting to explore. Something had been added to me that I knew would stick and never go away. I had tasted a bit of the great beyond, but was still completely aware of the fact that it may just be pure chemistry. Then followed ideas of entheogens, a form of life, that humans as a form of life use to get closer to an ultimate existence and more understanding. Dimensions and possibility opened up and I new there was something in psychedelics worth exploring more, specifically entheogens. I thought that life was just a trick, we go about searching for the meaning of life, but to find it we just have to close our eyes and see that we are it. Consciousness a dimension of its own capable of feeling touch smell sound taste and all the mind experiences I had felt that day. I understood monks, meditation and shamans. Was this intrinsic understanding? Or mental chemistry, my psyche tricking itself into rationality? It all came within minutes, and I had ultimate wellbeing.



I tried to explain it to everyone, and they knew what I was talking about. Or did they? 2 said I would never be the same again, and couldn't call myself a Christian any more. We then stopped by a church to wait for a friend and for 2 to come back with the cider. At this point I realised I had a mouth and forgot I had a gobstopper inside it, when I realised this, I could no longer feel my mouth in a traditional sense, I felt it not as a location or a sensations of taste or texture, but in my brain and realized all senses as just a brain function. The gobstopper moving in my mouth could be felt as if in the back of my head and abstractly, it was beginning to get too intense and I spat it out, normality returned in that region. The church extended to eternity, shadows in the sky made it look like a castle, and patterns forming all around it.



T + 9.30 Between 9:30 and 11 drinking and weed smoking took over.  The wallpaper was textured with a pattern, I said something like ``You have the best wallpaper ever man'' and then 1 and 2 looked and went ``Woahhh!'' I felt strange for the 6 who were not on the trip. I asked to roll a joint, quickly realizing that I couldn't do it and giving the materials back to a capable person. After a while I realized I had trailed a lot of mud into the house, sitting cross legged now, I saw the mud on the floor where my foot was. I pointed it out to the house owner and apologized promising to clean it up on the way out. Mud? What mud? Where had I been where had this much mud? No where no one else in the room had been. I started to associate this with my revelation which was still unraveling in my head, like a new organ making itself comfortable. I thought this meant I had been somewhere else, the great beyond. And it also became clear that the mistakes we make in life, like dragging mud into the house were quite natural and unimportant, the physical world my deterministic and our bodies are part of that, so there was nothing to fear in that respect.



Outside we went to smoke the joints, 2 or three trips out and in were made, each one with more joints intensified the experience more. I looked at the grass in the darkness and could see a massive rope like thing shaped like a ``\#'' but extended diagonally and vertically. I still seen all the patterns, but the trip was now more in the mind and body. After drinking through 10 units I was feeling far more chatty, trying to explain my ideas and philosophies to sober people, but still feeling so enlightened. I can't remember details after about 11. I was going to stay at 2's house, but I could only have one person stay, and 1 lived very far away. So I got the train home with my changed state of being and sense of wellbeing, drank some wine, smoke a cigarette, pondered existence, then went to bed enjoying visuals for a while before dosing off.



The next morning I could still see closed eye visuals of patterns when I closed my eyes, which soon faded. It was my birthday today and I was changed forever, a whole new sense of life and being part of the universe. I began associating my experience and revelation to the circumstances it arrived in. The day before my birthday, an Aquarian birth, in the age which I just learnt today could be the age of Aquarius or at least almost. On this day I tried my first long lasting entheogen (salvia before). Actually I just realized that I tried salvia when celebrating my last birthday\ldots stranger and stranger. And on the day of my birthday I woke up with a whole new look on life and a belief in spiritualism in connection with entheogens, though I my still skeptic and agnostic. And on that day I found 10 pounds on the ground in town, and had a revelation with salvia as well. Though the salvia was also combined with methylone,  mephedrone,  alcohol,  poppers and weed. Far more methylone though, and it was eaten, not snorted. But in the back of my mind I can't help but think it my just a psychological mind trick to ease myself with existence. But I new nothing of any sort of spiritualism and was completely against all religion until now. I will write about my salvia revelation sometime soon if people find this at all interesting. First report, sorry if it's not so good. Also, I can now see different perspectives of reality now, things beginning to wave, especially text on screen, and having other psychedelic feelings and symbols in my head that I can't draw or begin to describe. I couldn't see this before and my wondering whether this my expanded consciousness, like added brain functions. Or mild schizophrenia =/



Overall though, it was an enjoyable experience, and a new light has been shown that urges me to explore more. I wish it wasn't as real as it is.
