[Author's note: My experiences with entheogens and other drugs let me know some substances like 5-MeO-DiPT, 5-MeO-MiPT, 5-MeO-DALT, 5-MeO-AMT, 4-AcO-DiPT, 2C-B, 2C-D, 2C-I, 2C-B-Fly, MDMA, Methylone, MDPV, MDBP, mCPP, LSD-25, Psilocybes, GHB/GBL, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, Cocaine, Khat, Cannabis, Nutmeg, Salvia Divinorum, and maaaany other chemicals like dozens of nootropics, benzos, and many more, and plants, like Passion Flower and other IMAOS, and maaany more, including lots of combos.]



I was on my home, it was the 10 a.m. Instead taking my usual vitamin/mineral/ginseng combo, I decided don't do it. It was a very rainy day and I'm too constipated to go to the pharmacy's faculty of the Universitat de Barcelona as every day. I have some tryptamines that I bought some months ago, some of them even a year or two, on various reputated research chemicals sellers. One of them is the apreciated 5-MeO-DiPT. It passed more than a year since last time I took this sexy tryptamine. In the past it was my most appreciated aphrodisiac, and I took it more than 50 times on a 6 month period. I decided to do a short-time experiment taking various little 1mg insufflated doses, waiting the first milligram coming on, before taking the next.



[10:30] 1 mg of  the purest superwhite transparent crystals is insufflated.As you can supose, I felt nothing.



[T+0:10] It passed 10 minutes since the first milligram, and I redose insufflating another milligram. I feel some enhancing on colors, some effects reminiscent of tryptamines, but almost unnoticeable.



[T+0:20] Another milligram of Foxy Methoxy is insufflated. I start to feel like a mix of a tryptaminic state and a nootropic state. It's not the first time I feel it. I think some tryptamines at low dosages can act as nootropics. Now I'm feeling a (+).



[T+0:30] Another milligram insufflated. Because I don't feel the usual anxiety associated with the onset of this substance, I continued my experiment redosing a milligram, reaching 4 milligrams, that, beeing insufflated, equal to 6 or 7 oral milligrams. I start to feel a little contemplative, and surprisingly I have less anxiety than 30 minutes before. I played chill out music, that sounds sublime, and find myself seeing the rain and thinking ``Wow, I feel so good just seeing the water drops falling of the sky and hearing chill out music\ldots''.



[T+0:40]

Now, I'm in an antidepresive state, peaking the experience, in which I don't need to see what time is it, because I haven't any anxiety. I have reached the (++) in the Shulgin's scale. If I analyze my state from an ayurvedic point of view, I feel that 5-MeO-DiPT at this dosage have balanced my ``Sadhaka pitta'' and ``Prana vata''. Less impulsivity and less anxiety. More balanced feelings and emotions, and a sexy state of mind. A fresh and smooth tryptaminic state of mind, although it wasn't a really psychedelic state at this dosage.



[T+1:30] I returned to baseline in just 1 hour since the last milligram insufflated. I smoke a little marijuana (that clouded  my mind a little, normal effect with some tryptamines) and eat some food that tasted marvelous. It was a short-time, although refresher experience.
