Well, it all started when my grandmother got her molars removed for a set of false teeth.  She was in extreme pain so they gave her a perscription for 30 pills of 7.5/775 mg's of Hydrocodone/Aceteminophen.  I have been smoking weed and drinking alcohol for the past 2 1/2 years of my life, but not alot lately.  A while back, maybe 7 or 8 months ago, I found out all about the world of perscription drugs via the internet.  By just reading the entries and experiences of other people I became fascinated, but not enough to experiment myself.



Of course I'm a very daring person.  I tried cocaine for the first time about a year back because a friend dared me to.  The same for MDMA.  And when I came upon LSD, it was purely by accident, but I loved it.  But perscription pills were a bit different.  Of course I thought `Oh!  They're harmless\ldots If doctors give them out to help people, they can't kill anyone!'  But as I researched more and more about these drugs, I got more and more hesitant about trying them out.  Until the day I found a new green bottle of pills that had joined the collection in my grandmother's mini pharmacy in the kitchen.



I asked my grandmother about them and she told me that they were supposed to numb the pain in her mouth, but that it made her feel awful.  As soon as she said that, I knew they had to be some kind of heavy duty painkiller.  So I memorized the name and went searching for it online.  When I found out what they were, I nearly peed on myself.  My grandmother has bottles upon bottles of pills in the kitchen, but none of them were ever listed as having recreational effects.  So a couple of days went by and I didn't dare try to take pills from the abandoned pill bottle.  My grandmother might be old, but she's not stupid.  If 5 pills were to suddenly disappear from a 29 pill bottle, she'd find out in a second.  Then one day I was in the kitchen washing dishes and I noticed the bottle wasn't there.  I didn't dare ask her about it so I left it alone.  



About 4 days later, my grandmother had another appointment, leaving me in the house alone.  I woke up at around 12:30 and went to get something to eat.  When I came back, I took out my turkey and swiss cheese with mayo on a hero and Doritos and set it on the table.  I was missing something and went into the freezer and took out a bottle of Malta (a spanish malt beverage).  I couldn't open the bottle with my hands, so I went into a small cabinet for the bottle opener, when lo and behold the little green pill bottle was in there between two butcher knives.  I instantly got happy and forgot about the sandwich on the table.  I read the label to make sure it was the right medication and slipped it into my robe pocket.  I got the bottle opener, opened my malta and put away the sandwich and doritos in the fridge.  I took the bottle of pills out of my pocket and contapelated whether to take them or not.  I opened it and tapped it lightly over my open palm.  Two long oval shaped white pills fell into my hand.  I closed the bottle and put it back in my pocket.  I stared long and hard at the two pills in my hand, thinking it over.



I thought `I might as well\ldots This is the best time to do it.  Nobody's home, I have music and internet to keep me occupied, I have a nice soft bed if I got tired, and I have a nice clean toilet in case things go badly\ldots Ah\ldots What the hell!'  And with that I popped the two pills in my mouth and swallowed them whole with a sip of the malta.  This was at around 1:25 in the afternoon.  It wasn't until after I had already swallowed them when I remembered that I was supposed to chew them up a bit first for it to dissolve quicker in my system.  But I dismissed it as I downed the rest of my malta and put on Z100.  They were giving Beyonce's `To The Left' and I started singing along with it, like I always do.  It wasn't until after the song was over when I noticed that I was a bit lightheaded and this pain that I had in my ankle when I broke it last month was wearing off little by little.  I just thought it was a placebo effect because of the fact that this was my first time doing something like this with a drug that was actually LEGAL!  So I didn't think much of it until I had sang and danced to about 7 songs without feeling a bit tired afterwards.  I thought `Hey!  This is cool!  I can loose ALOT of weight on this!' and kept on dancing.  



About half an hour later, around 2 pm I stopped dancing and grabbed another malta.  I notice, under the influence of this drug, I became dehydrated very easily.  As I was trying to open the bottle, I noticed that I couldn't feel the cold of the bottle in my hand.  I mean, I felt the bottle in my hand, but the coldness just wasn't there.  So I finally got the bottle open with some help from the bottle opener.  I got tired of the music they were giving on the radio, turned it off and sat down in front of my computer.  I put a mixed CD into my pc and got on the internet.  By this time I felt very mellow and kind of\ldots Airy you can say.  Like when I closed my eyes, I felt like I could fly.  And it was getting a bit hard to keep my eyes open.  When I got online I got a flurry of IM's from my friends and family.  I responded to them all, taking a bit more time then usual to make sure I didn't make any mistakes on the keyboard.  I noticed I was a bit more talkative too.  Like I was talking to a friend who I didn't know so much and I usually felt a bit weird talking to them otherwise.  But that day, the words flowed out of my finger tips and onto the keyboard easily.  



After around 20 minutes of just talking to people, I checked my email and myspace.  I also noticed things I never noticed before.  Very little things though.  Then I went to check out other people's experiences with Vicodin.  In the beginning, reading the experiences was enjoyable and easy.  But after a while, the screen got a bit fuzzy and the stories got boring.  So I said bye to whoever I was talking to and signed off of AOL.  I sat back for a minute, not wanting to get up, but wanting to lay on the couch for a while.  When I got up, I felt very light.  Like I was floating.  It was difficult to keep my balance while walking.  The couch is right next to the pc, but I walked around my apartment just for the fun of it.  I finally got bored and dropped onto the couch.  I have this pain in my lower back that I got when I fell off of a jungle gym when I was four and usually when I lay down on the couch, the pain goes through my back very lightly.  But when I got comfortable on the couch, there was nothing.  No pain, no nothing.  So I got silly and started pinching myself lightly on my thigh to see what would happen.  When I felt nothing, I pinched harder and harder until a small bruise formed on my thigh.  I smiled, satisfied with myself and closed my eyes, letting the music take over my ears.  I fell asleep shortly after that.



Around 2 hours later, five p.m, I woke up to the front door opening.  My grandma had come back from her appointment and had some lunch for us.  I got up, a bit groggy from sleep and walked normaly to the bathroom.  I looked perfectly normal, a bit tired, but nothing extremely different.  I still felt some of the effects of the drug.  Like slight lightheadedness and pain still didn't come completely to me when I pinched the bruise on my thigh.  I peed and went to my room.  I collapsed onto my bed and slowly started falling asleep.  I noticed when I was laying down in the quiet, dark room, my breathing would slow down and sometimes I would even forget to breath.  But I never noticed I wasn't breathing until I took a deep breath as if I'd been under water for a while.  That kind of freaked me out, but I told my self `You slept for 2 whole hours earlier and you didn't die.  Just calm down and go to sleep.'  And I did.



So when I woke up at around 8:30 that night, I felt completely normal.  And the bruise on my thigh was pulsing lightly, making me reget pinching it so much.  And the pain in my ankle was back.  But other than the pain coming back to my body, I felt fine.  No after effects, no hangovers.  It went away just like that, for me.  



I think overall, this was a very pleasant experience for me.  Especially for it being my first time with legal perscription pills.  I did experience slight nausea when I was on the net talking to people, but it went away as soon as it came.  And it was a surprise for me when only two pills fucked me up pretty good because I have a very high tolerance to drugs, and also because I'm a bit larger than average for my height so I thought only two pills would get me a slight buzz.  But it really did me in.    I'm glad I tried this out because one, I get these really bad cramps during my period and I asked my doctor about prescribing Vicodin because it's the only thing that works for me, and two he did prescribe it for me and I use them when I need to and once in a while to get a nice pain free buzz.  I was never one to get addicted to anything, I even smoked cigarettes at a time in my life and I was the only one of my friends who could say no to a cigarette.  So I'm not scared of getting addicted to this drug like other people have.  So far I haven't had any cravings to take it and I've even stopped cold turkey a few times for 4 or 5 days at a time.
