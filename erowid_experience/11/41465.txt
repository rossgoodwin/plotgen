The following is an account of the first real tobacco experience I had. I started smoking stogues (cigarettes) about 4 years ago, but always failed to inhale, fearing lung cancer, but never understanding why I was not receiving the head rush everyone else seemed to love.



It was a normal summer day of going to my friend J's house and buying a small sack of weed (today it was \$40), and trying to make it last throughout the day \& night. J had obtained a pack of Malboro 27's, a cigarette I enjoy more than the rest. At the time I had never felt the intense light-headedness everyone else loved stogues for, and I wasn't expecting to this time. After about a 30 minute walk to a nearby church while listening to J talk about how he thinks hes addicted, making up random facts to support his story. I was in a pretty good mind set, it was summer, no summer school and a little bank, and I was expecting a good time later that day. From what I remember it was just me and J, though my friend R may have been there too, I'm not sure.



Anyways, we finally reached the church and proceeded to wait for the dealer to arrive, and I decided to have a stogue to pass the time. I lit one and J kept telling me to inhale, and I kept replying that I was. Finally he put it bluntly: Hit it like your hitting a joint. I decided to give it a try, to hell with my lungs. I took a deep breath and immediatly felt a rush of harsh smoke stream down my throat, causing me to cough. At that second I remember thinking `What a dumb fucking idea', but about 3 seconds after it had felt like I had been sitting for a day and stood up so fast it made my head spin. I had to sit, for fear of falling over. I continued to take huge drags, this time inhaling.



Finally our dealer come through and arrived on his longboard with the baggie. We paid him and he commented on me looking fucked up on something. I kept babbling about how cigarettes are opening my mind to a new extent, and kept stating that I could think of anything right then and there. I was proven wrong every time when J would respond `Then think of something smart that will make us rich', and every time I found myself at a loss. Then J and me decided that I should smoke three stogues at a time to rocket my first experience. I was too light headed to argue, and had to admit it sounded like a good idea at the time. We originally decided for me to smoke 5, but my mouth couldn't steadily hold all those at once so we settled for 3.



Upon placing three cigarettes in my mouth J lit them all up and I took such a fat drag that I filled the empty church hallway with smoke. I immdeiatly felt like I was swimming in mid air, and seconds later found out I had let two of the three stogues fall from my mouth, each landing dangerously close to my clothing. J is the kind of person who would sit and laugh while watching you burn, so that could have been a fatal situation. Fortunatly I came to and gave him one while I smoked both of the others, one in each hand while taking drag after consecutive drag.



Finally we got to packing a bowl of some silver haze, some of the best damn marijuana I have ever tasted (still to this day, a year later). Walking home was hard, as I smoke stogue after stogue, and by the time we got to J's house, I felt some mild nausea. Which was OK, as we were planning to light a bowl as soon as we got to his room.



In conclusion, my first experience was a real good one, and to this day I smoke many, many cigarettes to try and get that state of light headedness. I've now found a love for rolling tobacco, as it is so much more effective its not even funny.
