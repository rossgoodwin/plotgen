A few nights ago with my best friend, we both took a `shroomhusca' concoction, consisting of B. caapi tea, followed by a large dose of DMT and a large dose of hawaiian Copelandia cyanascens mushrooms. The resulting trip was the most powerful, mystical, intense and profound experience of my life to date. 



I've been using psychedelics for quite a few years now-in particular LSD, mushrooms, san pedro, and 2CE, as well as a spattering of others including ayahuasca, salvia, iboga, 2CI, 2CB, 2CT2, as well as other perception altering chemicals such as ketamine, mdma and cannabis in particular.



DMT is a different kettle of fish to all the other psychedelics I've experienced-all the other psychedelics seem like add-ons by comparison-DMT is the real deal. It is the drug that most closely resembles serotonin-while being one of the simplest psychedelics, and it is a naturally occurring brain hormone found in all our brains, and commonly throughout the natural world. While it is clearly a very powerful drug, when I am on it I can tell that own internal levels have simply been turned up a notch. I feel surprisingly clear and sober.



We fasted for 6 hours before drinking the the caapi tea, the effects alone following drinking, producing a mood life and a mild feeling of pressure in the head. We bolied the tea down to a single shot, which always seems to be effective.



40 minutes later we took 350mg of DMT (in the form of Mimosa hostilis root bark extract), and 1 gram of dried Hawaiian mushrooms (Copelandia cyanascens). Around 20 minutes later effects from this mixture began to be felt, and seemed to increase exponentially. My friend purged after an hour, several times, which left him feeling weakened. He thinks, perhaps rightly, that the ayahuasca did not approve of being used in combination with mushrooms, and was punishing him.



As the effects continued to escalate in depth and intensity, I felt a combination of deep ecstasy and the same time was made to face my demons in a wholesome but intense way. Up to a point, this intensity grew almost unbearable-and the trip suddenly began to take on a dark, and creepy nature. Good music is a useful ally in these situations. Suddenly I knew I must purge immediately, and rapidly scrambled to the toilet, with my co-ordination severely impaired. Now I've purged on ayahuasca, san pedro and iboga before, but the intensity of the purging on this trip was incredible. The vomit seem to erupt out of me, and I seemed to roar as it came. It was like the energy of the plants was driving this. After the purge I began to feel very different.



I felt much lighter in my body, the darkness of the trip vanished, and I was completely and utterly saturated in the most rich, liquid bliss. Even more so than I could imagine possible. I was completely saturated with liquid light and energy, and this was by far the highest I've ever been. At this point I seemed to be traveling through dimensions entirely outside myself and seemed to be being guided by the plants. I felt so utterly at peace, so comfortable and so privileged to be experiencing such profound beauty, that I turned to my friend and described it simply like being in the presence of God, which for me is incredible as I've never had revelations that reached such depths on any previous experience. A bit later on in the experience, we went for a walk outside, which was an incredible spectacle for the senses. All the plants were humming with dark energy fields, and the clouds looked completely alien and ethereal.



At times during the trip, we tried smoking some ganja. The message I got from the `shroomhuasca' is that this is a bad idea. One time a single toke resulted in a large purging, and later just the thought of smoking more produced feelings of darkness and nausea. I have never experienced this before, but the effect was very noticeable, and my friend also noticed this interesting effect. The plants used in the brew really do seem to have their own agenda. Even, you could say, a personality of sorts! This is made even more interesting as a very respected and skilled Ecuadorian shaman I have drank ayahuasca with before is against combining marijuana with ayahuasca, and is of the opinion that the ganja blocks the healing effects of the ayahuasca brew.



All in all, this experience was incredible beyond what I thought possible, and although certain details of the trip are hard to remember, much like dreams, much still remains vivid, and the profoundness of what occurred has not dulled at all, and indeed I continue to feel a noticeable afterglow.
