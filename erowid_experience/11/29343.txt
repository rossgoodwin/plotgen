I must begin by saying that 5-MeO-AMT is a dangerous substance and I would never recommend that anyone try doses as high as I have tried. I am a daily user of 5-MeO-AMT with a high tolerance and I am a very large adult to boot. Please use extreme caution when experimenting with ths drug.



This report is going to be long but I wish to explain the good things and the bad things about (in my opinion) this miraculous drug.



Contrary to what many say, 5-MeO-AMT can be an addictive drug, especially depending on your life circumstances. I first recieved a 7mg sample of the drug about 5 months ago from a friend. He told me marvelous things about it and related it closely to acid and ecstacy. At the time I had a lot going on in my life and was fighting an addiction to opiates (which thankfully I am over), so I left the sample on my desk for a couple months. 



One night a few months ago I was very depressed and all my marijuana was gone. My dealer was out of town and the liquor store was closed. Then I remembered the sample of 5-MeO-AMT my friend had given me a couple months back. Eagerly I poured the small amount of powder into my palm and licked it off. The taste was bitter, but beable. I had only eaten a very small amount of food that day so vomiting wasn't too bad of a problem. The diarrhea was the worst. The entire nite I felt immensely content and noted light visual patterns. I was laughing a lot and for the first time in forever I smiled so much my cheeks were sore. I could compare it most to a feeling of rolling on ecstasy. Having been depressed I chalked this up to be an awesome drug and I really wanted to try it again.



The next day I searched for 5-MeO-AMT on the internet and found a chemical company selling it for a very decent price at 99.9+\% purity. I ordered 1 gram of it and recieved it 2 days later.



It has been about 3 months since I first started dabbling with 5-MeO-AMT. With the exception of a few days I tried going without, I have done it every single nite. I have done it at least 70 or 80 times. The days I tried going without I was extremely depressed and angry, I wanted to kill everyone for no reason (I fought feelings like that as a teenager and they only came back for a brief period during opiate withdrawal and at this time), I was restless and took several milligrams of different benzodiazipines (none of which helped) and I found myself often binge eating until I vomited and smoking a lot of cigarettes for no reason. After I went to visit the Alpha Goddess, all these feelings of withdrawal went away immediately.



Onto better things. I have tried several different ways of taking 5-MeO-AMT. Smoking (which proved to be a waste), insufflating and oral ingestion. In my opinion oral ingestion is the best way to go. I weigh out an amount on my scale, put it in my palm, lick it off and take a swig of some alcohol. In small amounts (1-10mg) the taste is very bareable. But if your taking an extremely large amount (30+mg) you will probably want to vomit from the taste. From smoking I honestly didn't recieve any notable effects. And while insufflating gets the substance to kick in faster, when doing it in amounts over 20mg it is extremely painful to the sinus cavities and the post-nasal drip made me want to vomit. 



During the first couple weeks of my 5-MeO-AMT use I only took amounts between 5-15mg. These small amounts did not cause me to vomit or give me any noticeable side effects. There were no visuals in these amounts. But I did get extreme feelings of happiness throughout the nite. However, at doses between 5-15mg the effects of the drug became extremely mild after a while. And the trips were only lasting an average of 4 to 6 hours. I was obviously disappointed with this because I hate tolerance. So I eventually started doing more and more. I would take doses of 25-35mg on a nightly basis. At these higher doses the happiness I had once experienced from the drug no longer occured. Instead it became a lot more like acid. Inanimate objects would come alive, I would get deeply thrown into movies or books, I could see auras around colors, music never sounded so profound and heartfelt, etc. However, I would get vey sick and vomit a lot. And it got the point where I was dehydrated almost everyday and lost about 30lbs since I began using 5-MeO-AMT. This did not stop me though. I loved the mental state it put me in. I loved the euphoria, the deep, deep thinking and most of all I loved the mind-altering effects. It made me become a more calm and happy person.



A few days ago I wanted to go all out. I wanted to go to a place I had never been before. I measured out 100mg of 5-MeO-AMT with a very precise scale a friend let me borrow. I divided the 100mg into 3 piles. Two piles of 40mg and one pile of 20mg. I knew this could be very dangerous, perhaps deadly. But, as disturbed as this may sound. I didn't care if I died or not. Here is what happened:



5:30 PM - I licked 40mg of 5-MeO-AMT off my kitchen table. I quickly downed a Mike's Hard Lemonade to wash the taste out of my mouth. I preceded to sit down and watch `King Of The Hill'.



6:05 PM - My stomach is beginning to feel uncomfortable. I continue to smoke some cigarettes and am starting to regret eating those two chicken pot pies.



6:20 PM - I'm tossing and turning, trying to fight the nausea. I drop my half-smoked cigarette in my glass of water. I am profusely sweating at this point. I roll over on the channel changer and the volume turns up several notches and Slayer's `Dead Skin Mask' is blaring loudly on the music channel. I have a deaf landlord downstairs (which I forgot of at the time). I quickly jump off the couch slamming the ground. I shut the TV off and puke about 5 or 6 times in a bucket. I probably scared the shit out of my landlord.



6:30 PM - I'm still laying on the floor. My legs hurt very, very bad. I think this is due to dehydration. It is extremely painful to stand. I waddled to the couch as quickly as possible and plopped down.



7:00 PM - I am beginning to peak. I always peak around 1 1/2 hours. I feel very comfortable and the stomach pain and bowel pressure have gone away completely. It feels as if I'm sinking into the cushions of the couch\ldots like I'm laying on a cloud. I see vibrant streaks or red and green moving across the walls and ceilng. My sister lives with me. She comes home and doesn't know I am on 5-MeO-AMT. She doesn't think I do drugs anymore. I normally would start to panic but I was so comfortable I didn't give a shit. I told her I took some sleeping pills and drank some alcohol. She shrugs it off, puts the groceries away and sits down with me. We begin watching `Meet The Parents'. At the time, this seems to be the most hilarious movie in the world! It's so comical, so vivid. I feel like I'm in the room with the actors. 



8:00 PM - I'm still tripping hard. It's getting difficult to focus on anything outside of my mind. Including the movie and any conversation. I keep words short and brief wit my sister. I keep forgetting what the hell she's babbling about. She's getting annoying. She says she's tired and is going to bed. Thank god!



8:30 PM - The once hilarious movie is getting very boring. I turn on the Techno music channel. The music sounds great. It's as if I'm listening to every single beat and instrument individually. It seems perfectly composed. I can't wait to listen to other types of music, but I'm starving. I get up to make myself a chicken sandwich with french fries and devour it. 



9:30 PM - Wanting an even more intense trip I lick the second 40mg pile of 5-MeO-AMT off my desk and quickly wash out the taste with a few big sips of 20 year old Sambuca. I waddle back to the couch. My legs still hurt quite a bit. I pop the `Dahmer' movie into my VCR and go back to the couch. I'm watching previews of films made by some independent film companies. Wow, those actors are TERRIBLE. I quickly fast forward to the movie.



10:30 PM - I am starting to feel extremely high. I cannot feel my body. My mind feels extremely disconnected. I cannot focus on more than one thing at a time. What I'm focusing on right now is solely the movie. I feel like I'm right beside Jeffrey Dahmer, living the painful and shocking events of his life. The movie is three dimensional. Everything is literally sticking out of the TV screen. I heard terrible reviews about this movie. But to me, at the moment, its best movie I've ever seen. I begin to realize how much I can relate to Jeffrey Dahmer. I feel his mental and emotional pain. I never knew how much our childhoods were alike. Divorced parents, lots of time alone, no friends, doing anything for attention, very violent thoughts. I feel like I know Jeffrey Dahmer personally and its beginning to disturb me in a way. The room is blurry, all I can see is the three dimensional television. Life does not exist outside of this movie.



11:30 PM - The movie is over. The trip is getting stronger and stronger. I think the normal person would freak out at this point, or think they were going to die. But I feel as if I know the Alpha Goddess personally. I feel that she will keep me safe. I look at my hands. They are vibrating, they look fake. I can see every little line on my hands. The ceiling is moving back and forth. The design on the tiles of the ceiling are spinning around and around slowly. How beautiful. The walls are breathing with me. They morph into weird shapes everytime I take a breath. The chair on the other side of the room is staring at me. It looks like a brown version of the Cookie Monster, except really, really fat and it has big black eyes. I'm melting into the couch. I don't really know what's going on, but I'm enjoying it and laughing.



12:00 AM - The intense visuals persist. I put In Flames' `Lunar Strain' album into my stereo. Music hs never sounded so intense. I can tell my legs hurt, but I'm so high I get up in the middle of the room and start dancing wildly to a duet of a violin and guitar playing beautiful celtic music. The chairs are bouncing up and down. A plant in the corner of the room is dancing to the music. Theres a man inside the wall dancing with me (I later realized it was just me looking into the mirror). There are flower patterns on my couch. The flowers are rising from the couch and breathing. I tell them hello and laugh.



1:00 AM - I'm so thirsty and physically exhausted. But my mind is still going strong. It was a struggle walking through the kitchen to the pantry. There are no lights on, yet I am blinded by patterns that look like beautiful peacock feathers. I slam into everything on the way to the pantry and I awake my sister. She asks me what the hell I'm doing. I told her I was tired and thirsty. She asked me a question. I couldn't hear her. She asked me again, I still couldn't here her. Then I yelled `I'm going to bed!' but to me it sounded like `bahblah gahgah buuuud'. I could faintly understand her saying `ok, just be quiet'. I wanted to make myself a rum and coke really bad. But since I do not have a refridgerator I have to keep drinks on my porch. I stood at the door struggling to open it for about 5 minutes. My sister asked me what I was doing and I kept muttering something about the door, yet I had no clue what I was talking about. For some damn reason I couldn't slide the deadbolt across. I gave up and just had a glass of water. 



3:00 AM - I can't believe this. I'm still tripping very hard. I have never been to this plateau in my life and I have done a countless number of drugs. I'm lying on my bed and the ceiling is inching closer to me. My vision is very clouded with different colors, even with my eyes open and all the lights in my room on. My cat jumps onto my bed and lovingly meows at me. I feel strong, stong feelings of love and give him a big hug. He lays down next to me and I rub his belly. He gets up and starts to walk away. He looks so weird\ldots it looks as if he's walking on the moon or something. My cat is very fat and has bad legs. He fell off the edge of my bed and I began laughing hysterically. It had to be the funniest thing I ever saw in my life. 



4:30 AM - Time is flying by so fast. I have listened to so many bands. So many different styles of music. In Flames, Devourment, Disgorge (Mexico), Dj Keri, The Bee Gees, Jehro Tull, Joe Walsh, Jimi Hendrix, Mark Et Cloude, Enya, I even listened to some old school rap. I'm actually geting bored with it. I start to wander the depths of my rather disturbed mind. I think about walking down the street and torturing and dismembering a group of Puerto Rican neighbors that make fun of me. The thought made me smile immensely. I just laughed it off. My body felt very numb. For some odd reason I wanted to feel pain and see blood. I got a very sharp knife from the kitchen and sliced my thigh open. The blood feels so sensual. I keep wiping it on my hands and licking it off. I put a bandaid on it.



5:15 AM - The trip is fading somewhat. The life like hallucinations are going away. I decide its time to finish the 100mg. I grab a straw and go over to my desk. In one huge snort I insufflate the remaining 20mg. It burns so bad! I drop to the floor, my right eye is tearing uncontrollably, my sinuses burn. I try to suck all of it back into my throat and quickly wash out the taste with a few huge cups of water. 



5:45 AM - The pain subsided within 10 minutes. I layed on my bed for the past 30 minutes and have stared at the ceiling. Admiring the beautiful texture and gazing as colors fly around it. The design on the ceiling tiles are starting to slide down the wall. Colors from my wooden door are seeping down onto the carpet. I am enjoying this so much. Thank you Alpha Goddess.



6:30 AM - I am walking around the house, watching objects morph and swirl. I go to the bathroom and laugh at the fat dazed-looking man in the mirror. The sun is beginning to rise. I peer throug the blinds into the woods behind my house. The trees look as if they're all connected. I cannot distinguish the branches of one tree from another. It looks so gorgeous. Again, it looks like a giant peacock spreading its magnificent, beautiful feathers in the morning sun.



7:00 AM - I am beginning to feel mentally exhausted. I decide to take 50mg of Zolpidem (Ambien) with a glass of Sambuca. Hoping it'll knock me out cold. I sit cross-legged on my bed, staring at my feet and how weird they look. My toe nails are bothering me so I get the clippers and cut them. I am cutting them down so short without realizing it that my toes are now bleeding profusely. I quickly stop.



7:20 AM - The Ambien is really kicking in. I feel totally disconnected from my body. Like I've taken a large dose of Ketamine or something. I keep blacking out and seeing magnificent rainbows. Right before I passed out I muttered to myself (for some reason) `This is what god must feel like\ldots '.



I slept for about 15 hours. Throughout the entire time I had extemely weird and vivid dreams. A lot of them centered around sex. They were deeply perturbing. They involved homosexuality, incest and rape. 



When I finally awoke I was having a lot of trouble breathing. It was difficult to swallow anything and extremely difficult to talk. I sounded like I was retarded everytime I went to mutter a word. I went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. To my shock that thing that dangles in the back of your throat (forget what the medical term is) was swollen about 5 times its normal size. It was so inflammed it was resting against the middle of my tongue and was almost completely blocking my throat. I quickly went down to the Walgreen's that thankfully is open 24/7 and I showed the pharmacist my throat. She told me I needed to go to the ER immediately. So I went and after a 4 hour wait the doctor finally saw me. He said he rarely sees this kind of thing (I did not tell him I had ingested a large dose of a dangerous research chemical the nite prior). They immediately hooked me up to IVs and injected me with anti-inflammatory steroids. They also took 4 vials of blood from me for testing. After about 2 hours of this the doctor gave me prescriptions for Amoxicillin and some steroids and told me that if it happens again to go to the hospital immediately. I then went home and my throat was a bit better. I was finally able to eat. But the only thing I could manage to get down was tuna fish and very soft bread.



That happened a few days ago and I am feeling completely fine now. The amount of 5-MeO-AMT I took is lethal. However, because I'm so big and have a tolerance like hell I was able to fly through the experience with the Alpha Goddess at my side. If this were my first, third, sixth, tenth time, etc and I was say a teenager and was very small. I could have easily died that nite. But like I mentioned I have done this substance about 70 or 80 times.



Some people may consider me an imbecile. But I know my limits. And that nite I definitely pushed my limits to the maximum. I have layed off the 5-MeO-AMT for a few days now, but have been using large amounts of marijuana to fight the withdrawal. 



I do not know what physical side effects the drug has given me. Obviously not much is known about this drug and I hate being a guinea pig but it is truly an amazing substance. Any side effects may not show up for years. They could include very serious damage to my brain and/or organs. 



When your messing with 5-MeO-AMT you are dancing with devil. As awesome as my trip may sound to some of you hardcore psychonauts or curious teenagers. Please exercise caution! As the old saying goes, `Death is final!'.
