I had started drinking at about 9pm in the evening and consumed a small bottle of vodka over 2 hours until 11pm, when myself and a few friends ventured out to a club. The usual drunken dancing and conversation ensued, and we stayed until 3am.



Back at our flat, it was decided that the night wasn't over. I was still drunk but not as much as my peak which was probably around 12 am. It was now 3.30am. I had recently tried ketamine for the first time 2 weeks prior to this night, and had had a couple of lines the day before, but not enough to feel the full effects. Before, I had felt dreamy, with slight time warps and faint hallucinations and perception of things in the room etc. This night, however, was to be very different. I snorted two lines of about 50mg each fairly quickly after each other and proceeded to smoke a joint of pure weed. Normally I am quite cautious and this was out of character - but with the alcohol I had lost my inhibitions of taking too many drugs and mixing drugs, both of which I am wary of normally.



I began to feel fairly high while smoking the joint, we were laughing for no apparent reason and everything seemed cool. It was then that the ketamine started to kick in. I can't remember the whole trip, but I know I didn't k - hole. What I did know at this point was that I was in for quite an experience. The best way to describe this would be to split it into stages of my experience:



1. I begin to feel very heavy and rooted to the floor. I assume this is the joint.



2. Heart is beating very fast. I am slightly worried as I realise how much i've taken.



3. I calm myself somewhat. The Ketamine is certainly in full effect by this point. I am very unaware of my surroundings.



4. I am aware of my body, but only of my skeleton. I feel like a skeleton sitting on the floor, all I can feel are my bones. My shoulders, ribs, back, and hands feel completely skeletal. Although I know there is flesh and organs there, I am only aware of my bone structure. This is very interesting and my thoughts are focused on how amazing the human body is.



5. I havent been looking anywhere in particular, and suddenly I realise that the room has lost all normality. In fact, I am no longer in what would be considered a room, I am in a nothingness, a vacuum. There are cartoon like patterns surrounding me, particularly on what was the carpet. If I concentrate on them it gets incredibly intense. Too intense for a novice I would say. I was literally nowhere, in a vast space of nothingness but coloured patterns and shaped. I feel that this is the `real' world and everything around isn't really there. 



6. I am quickly able to snap out of this state as my friend says I look very pale. I start getting worried now and realise my heart is still beating incredibly fast. It might have been my imagination, I can't be certain. 



7. I am trying to fight the effects. My friend has fallen asleep but I am still awake in a mild panic.



8. I assure myself I am fine and watch some stuff on youtube. the effects seem to be wearing off fairly quickly, and now I just feel the tail end of weed high. 



9. It's only 5.30am. Feeling exhausted I fall asleep on the sofa and wake up about 10am feeling fine.



having only done MDMA, Ketamine in small doses and cannabis fairly regularly, I can safely say this was pretty much the most intense drug experience I have had from a psychedelic/hallucinogenic perspective. I believe consuming alcohol beforehand worsened my trip. But overall it was an amazing experience and one that I would ceratinly repeat now I am more prepared for the effects and therefore less likely to panic.
