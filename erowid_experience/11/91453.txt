Recreational Drugs ingested (not including prescription meds):

125 mg Mephedrone

$\sim$30-40 mg Mephedrone insufflated

$\sim$10-20 g Kratom on 2 separate occasions

$\sim$10 mg 



Background:

25 year old college student currently finishing up my degree in cognitive science. Weigh around 200 lbs give or take and am in fairly good physical health. Have a large amount of experience with all kinds of drugs including many psychedelics, research chemicals, stimulants, depressants, dissociatives and opiates (also kratom though its not an opiate exactly). I have for the most part stopped using psychedelics though I plan on using LSD sometime in the future. I have never tried crystal meth and don't plan on it. The `hardest' drug I have tried is heroin (multiple times though I never really liked it as much as other opiates) so given that I have not turned into an H addict I probably won't with this. 



Other variables effecting the trip:

I am currently addicted to kratom but am tapering off of it. Also I am prescribed to lamotrigine (an anticonvulsant/mood stabilizer which acts by blocking sodium channels) 100mg twice a day and adderall 20mg 2-3 times a day though I usually don't take more than 2 except for when studying for finals or writing papers. I also smoke JWH-122 rolled cigs and have gotten to the point where I will very rarely smoke tobacco without it. I used to smoke JWH-018 from when I woke up to when I went to bed but have been good at saving it for evenings, very rarely using in the morning or afternoons (usually after 5 or 6 pm I will partake). 



Setting: 

My room off-campus room in a shared house during a sweltering summer day. It is around 3pm. Usually I would not do this this early but have gotten very little sleep and find myself useless when I do this. Mainly am at my computer surfing the net and reading blogs related to technology or neuroscience/cognitive science.



Mind-set:

A bit tired but feeling content and relieved after a long long train ride. Was happy to find my `item' had arrived in the mail, though not surprised since in the US it is still somewhat legal (federal analog but no attempt to prosecute venders/users). I have read some horror stories about addiction and am a bit nervous to try but have it in my mind to control myself thus will. Not going through anything too upsetting or traumatic at the moment but nothing that is making me extremely happy.



Dosage: 

125 mg of 4-MMC (mephedrone) in crystal form weighed out with a milligram scale. Took about 10-20 grams of kratom before (did not weigh out). No adderall taken except for in the morning 10 mg.



t+ 00

125 mg weighed out and taken orally. Also took a medium to high dose of kratom to help with some pain I had when breathing after waking up. After a long train ride during which I got absolutely no sleep due to annoyances around me and uncomfortable amenities, I came back home (I live off campus in shared housing) with the hopes of finding the 4-MMC I ordered online (admittedly from a somewhat sketchy vendor) in the mail. I have just woken up from a 3-4 hour power nap and feel less tired. Also have weighed out another 25 mg dose which I will take if I do not feel much from the dose I took. 



t+ 0:12

Am feeling a bit of chest tension as though I am coming up on MDMA. Perhaps this is the kratom but since I take this everyday and haven't felt this as a result of it I don't think it is the kratom. 



t+ 0:15

Now am definitively feeling way more chest tension and a bit light headed. Also starting to feel some euphoria and also quite horny. 



t+ 0:20

Feeling way more euphoric as though I am coming up on MDMA. Getting a bit of nystagmus going on. Also great sense of euphoria. Way more chest tension. Music sounds AMAZING\ldots listening to some psytrance. I am having some trouble becoming focused but not so much staying focused once I begin to read a blog or write down info about this trip. 



t+ 045

Feeling AMAZINGLY AWESOME. Kind of like I am rolling but without the psychedelic touch. Senses feel like they are in overdrive like on an entactogen. Chest tension pronounced, music louder and more attention to intricate details. My palms are feeling sweaty and my head feels lighter . Moving through space feels like moving through liquid. On a side note an erection is nearly impossible to maintain. Eyes wiggling and getting a bit of streaking when looking towards changing focus. Extremely euphoric though not as intense as MDMA. There is a relaxing feeling to it although speedy quality overrides this. Sense of touch pronounced (already said that). Feeling way more sociable and less anxious about being in a social situation if I was. Great for partying. I also feel focused proof being that I have not digressed from this trip report. Pupils are dilated as fuck. Also smiling a lot. 



t+ 1:00

The kratom I took before taking this is beginning to have an effect. It is dulling the experience a bit though adding to the chilled out feeling while reducing the speedy effects. Probably won't take the two together ever again since it seems like the euphoria has dulled down a bit because of the kratom. There seems to be an anxiolytic effect as well which the kratom is intensifying. Am going to take a much needed shower and tooth-brushing.



t+ 1:30

Beginning to come down and feel like possibly snorting another 25 mg but probably won't. Still feeling the entactogenic effects but the euphoria is much less intense. Music isn't sounding as great as it used to and the chest tension I was feeling has subsided. Still feeling ok though but at this point this is probably because of the kratom. Am thinking of taking some adderall to see if it will act as a booster, bringing back some of the effects. Despite coming down I don't feel an intense urge to redose as has been reported by many; however, this does not mean mean that I wouldn't mind redosing as I still have an urge to do so though less than with cocaine which is surprising considering the obvious superiority to coke. Perhaps the lack of a fiendish state is because I regularly take at least 20mg of adderall a day. 



t+ 2:00

The adderall I took seems to have brought back a bit of the euphoria of the 4-MMC although I still feel as though I am coming down. The come down is kind of a bitch which is not surprising given the intense effects of the drug. General feeling of fatigue and dysphoria which is somewhat being reduced by the 20 mg adderall I took to see if there would be a boosting effect. Also took some more kratom ($\sim$10-20 g) Actually feeling a bit more fiendish than before because of this and also have a minor headache which could be caused by taking the adderall right after. It ain't that bad probably cause of the kratom. Going to eat something as I am feeling a bit hungry now.



t+ 4:00

Am not feeling any of the positive effects but not really crashing too hard. Don't really feel the need to redose orally at least. The psychonaut side of me wants to snort some to compare especially with an already weighed out 25 mg dose lying on my table. Crash is not as bad as I expected but this may be due to the relative small amount I ingested. 



t+ 7:00 

Finally was overcome with curiosity and after cutting up the 25 mg dose I had already weighed snorted it. It really hurts going up but I have done worse. Almost instantaneously the euphoria I experienced at the plateau came back but not with as much intensity (perhaps tolerance, perhaps not enough). So I added another $\sim$10 mg but did not use a scale which attests to the fiendish nature of snorting mephedrone. 



t+ 7:15

Finally beginning to feel a greater intensity, even more so than when I first started feeling the oral dose. I think the reason it took so long to get this may be the lack of time I spent cutting up the crystals. 



t+ 7:45

Feeling great now and hoping I will be coming down soon. This does not happen though and I take about 500 mg of Phenibut to help me go to sleep. I'm not hating the experience but would like to be able to fall asleep. Based on previous use of stimulants like adderall, coke and MDMA I know that it will be another 5 hours after plateau before I can even think about sleeping. Hopefully the phenibut will help since I have chores and other things to do tomorrow. 



t+ 8:00

Added another 10mg JWH-122 cig and I was flying real high. Felt like I was rolling without the insight and ego-softening. Am feeling just as euphoric as when I was first coming up but not as sped up and much more laid back. I probably shouldn't have smoked this but wanted to know how cannabinoids work with mephedrone. Great synergy. Wish I had some real weed for this.



t+ 10:00

Am still trying to fall asleep but to no avail. Will probably have a hard time tonight. 



t+ 18:00

What would be a trip report without an account of next-day effect? I am feeling sore all over though not as bad as with other drugs I have tried (especially MDMA). Feeling a bit fatigued and having a hard time waking up. Also have a minor headache and feeling mentally fogged up. Have eaten nothing but small snack throughout the experience and am still not hungry. 



t+ 21:00

Beginning to feel back to baseline especially after taking my morning (afternoon really) meds (adderall 20mg, lamotrigine 100mg) and kratom dosage ($\sim$10-15g). Still not too hungry but going to force myself to eat. 



Summary

In retrospect this is a very euphoric drug which can compare to a cross betweem MDMA and cocaine/amphetamine. There are empathogenic and entactogenic effect along with a clarity and euphoria that are similar to MDMA though lacking the introspective mind-opening experience of feeling `in-the-moment.' Essentially all the physical effects without any of the psychedelia and effects lasting about a quarter of the time. There as no jaw clenching for me when I orally ingested which is probably due to my regular amphetamine usage. Snorting it caused some jaw tension but not much. Definitely a great drug for going out and partying although not so good for everyday business such as work or studying, mainly because of the desire to bask in the euphoria of the experience. I can see how addiction potential may be high but I don't really feel the need to re-dose immediately. Perhaps will stock up before it is banned in the US. Would be interesting to combine this with methylone. 

	

In retrospect it is no wonder this drug is banned throughout the EU. I suspect it will be banned in the US soon but may be mainly at the state level as the media gains notice of dumb-ass kids (or adults) ODing or combining with other drugs. I suspect the reason it has not been federally banned is because of the meth problem in the US far outweighing problems with dose-sensitive RCs such as mephedrone. Hopefully states will not begin to ban anytime soon so I could stock up on this and other RCs. I would not give this drug or even tell anyone about it unless I knew they could handle it and be responsible with it.
