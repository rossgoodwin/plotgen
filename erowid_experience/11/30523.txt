Having just been dumped by my girlfriend and being immersed in the gray swirling vortex of clouds that is Portland, Oregon. I decided that I needed an escape from my troubles. It was April, and me and my friends were all still in school. Nutmeg sounded interesting to me as it is just a household spice. The idea that it could get me high was just something I had to try for myself. 



I went down the street to an organic food store near my house and purchased some bulk nutmeg: about seven nuts for \$1.77. I pulverized the nuts with my physics text book and ground up the chunks in a coffee grinder, and put precisely four teaspoons in a plastic baggie. I was going to go to the beach tomorrow with my friends, and I was going to get high (not on marijuana because I'd given it up for lent). 



I awoke early the next morning to leave for the spot I was getting picked up by my friends. Before I left I ate two teaspoons of the dreadful stuff. It tasted like someone was making Chai in my throat at first, and then it just got disgusting. I took the bus across town and waited for them to roll up in their car. As I waited (for two hours), I looked up at the sky. It was a morning sky with the sun rising in between patches of gray and white clouds. To me it looked beautiful, like a big orange egg yoke smiling at what would become a wonderful day. This could have been intensified by the drug, but I doubt it and I remember having the odd feeling that the sky was closer to me than usual, almost like a ceiling directly above me. That, I attributed to the nutmeg. 



When my friends finally arrived, I hopped in the car and they showed me the psilocybin mushrooms they were going to eat and the marijuana they would smoke. I responded with a firm `not me' and I whipped out my bag of nutmeg and started eating the rest. The taste of it was bad for me, it felt like eating sawdust and I felt a bit a twinge of nausea. Fortunately, I have a very weak sense of taste, and this permitted me to eat it all the old fashioned way. On the way to the beach (three hours where we were going), I played a miniature guitar to distract myself from the nausea of both the nutmeg and the car ride (I'm not used to riding in cars with automatic transmissions). 



It was during this drive (T +5) that I began to feel the effects of the nutmeg. It was like a drunken/stoned kind of buzz, except that I still felt like I could think clearly, and according to the people around me, I was. 



We actually got to the beach shortly after I could feel the nutmeg, and once there, I took in the bright white of the beach and the salt smell. My friends turned on some loud music and started eating mushrooms and smoking marijuana, and I sat down and played some guitar. I remember looking at the ceiling, which had a stucco-ed texture, and it looked like it was slowly moving away from me. I was playing guitar while I was looking up, and while I wasn't looking at the neck, I could clearly see it in my mind. I had absolute control over the instrument, and my friends were all really impressed.



After they'd done their drugs and we'd settled into the beach house, we all walked down to the shore. I was the only person seriously funked up at the time, and I still remember how cool it looked and felt with the salty air and our beachball games in the crazy wind. We walked down to haystack rock (which is this huge outcropping on the oregon coast) it was awesome. Everything took on a surreal quality and it felt like the world was a bright and beautiful place.



After a while on the beach, we went back to the house. It was during this time that I noticed my heart beating really fast. I thought I'd lay down and try and rest my head, so I layed down on a bed and closed my eyes. The instant I closed my eyes I saw these odd hallucinations which were, in ways, the most vivid hallucinations I'd ever seen. At first, I just saw these amoeba-shaped blobs of bright shifting colors, and then I opened my eyes and shut them again. This time, I saw a Jamaican band leader in a high-school-band-type marching band usiform playing a marimba with a loose calypso rhythm. He appeared to be like a moving stained-glass window, and as he played, I began to hear the music he was making inside my head.



I tried to tell my friends about this when we bought some ice-cream, but they really weren't interested. We went for a drive with one of my friends without a license driving, and I freaked out because he was really bad. After that, we returned to the beach and ran down the dunes until it got dark. Going down the dunes felt liberating, and over my vision appeared a slight white haze that gradually intensified. And I had intense afterimages of everything I saw. Looking back on it, I can't remember any exact times I went down the dunes, I just remember how it felt.



When it was dark, we went to the beach one last time and made a fire. Everyone was getting down with their girlfriends, and me without mine, I decided to ask this girl who I had met that day if she wanted to make out with me. Surprisingly, she said yes (I think she was getting back at her ex-boyfriend who was on the trip). So we did a little of this and a little of that.



We drove back that night, and I didn't sleep until I got home (at about one in the morning). I was really tired. The next day, I was able to reflect on the experience, but there was still a white haze over my vision. I realized I shouldn't have made out with that girl (she not my type, I couldn't really talk to her, it was not a good thing). But what was the most disturbing was the fact that I could still feel the nutmeg in me. I went to dinner with my parents that night, and it felt so wierd, like I was barely on top of the conversation, and that at any moment, the next comment might put me completely under the tide of words.



Time passed, and my daily sleep at that point was very low. I was taking classes starting at 7:20 AM, and I was doing homework and stuff until about 11 PM every night. I was not getting enough sleep for my standards, and I became enveloped in the white hazy nutmeg life. I remember sitting in Physics class and understanding the words that our teacher was saying, but not comprehending their meaning. It was just like a part of my brain was not switched on. 



Furthermore, one day in my history class, I was trying my hardest to pay attention, when suddenly, an huge purple plasma V emerged from my teacher's chest framing his head. I was gaping, open-mouthed at the spectacle, and I don't think I will ever forget that.



After lent, my life returned to normal. I would only think about doing nutmeg if I had a lot of time to waste. It was an interesting experience, and it felt beautiful when I was actually high, but the coming down period was very wierd and prolonged.
