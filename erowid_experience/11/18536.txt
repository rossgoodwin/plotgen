After finally measuring out an order of 5meo-AMT, I decide to take it for a test-drive.  Now, as an undergraduate college student, I happen to be taking a graduate level lab class that `happens' to occupy my Saturday mornings from 9:00AM.  Go figure, I'm informed of an extremely promising `rave' on Friday night.  Somehow I decide to test-drive this new psychedelic at this party and make it to class the next day.  At 5:30PM I took 4.4mg of the substance in a gelcap form (which looked like an almost empty pill) in the hopes that I would have timed the 12-hour trip to be down in time for class (I'm a diligent student like that).  What follows is a post-experience account of what happened.  I'm not sure why I had the reaction I did, but regardless I can't complain.



5:30 (T)  I take what I believe to be a 4.4mg pill.  In retrospect it may have been less, because while we had some issues with the scale (even the best laboratory ones wouldn't always read 5.0mg right), but nevertheless I have faith in its eventual accuracy.



5:45 (T+0:15)  I feel a little something, perhaps a +/-, a bit dizzy and unfocused but nothing undesirable.



7:00 (T+1:30)  I had only eaten a healty sandwich at about 3:30 in expectation of the vomiting or runs associated with this substance, but I didn't feel much of either at this point.  Slight stomach upset, and a slight pressure on the bowels is definately noticable, but nothing to purge about.



7:30-9:30 (T+2-4)  This is the period where I expected to begin the experience.  Spent entirely in anticipation, I was quite disappointed when nothing happened.  Or rather, something was going on, maybe a +1, but nothing anywhere near what I expected 4.4mg to do on the TIHKAL scale.  It should be noted that I felt a very slight warm feeling come over me at times, but it always led to dissappointment.  I had resisted the urge to smoke pot so I could realize the true unadulterated nature of the substance first.



11:30 (T+6)  At this point I had given up on my additional dose.  I still felt a `little something' and I liked what I felt, but I decided that perhaps a boost was in order.  I had read one report on an insufflated 1mg, and it seemed pretty intense, so I set out to try my best to measure .5-1mg.  Now, I'm as aware as any of the dangers of eyeballing doses so small, so I did my best to stay safe.  I opened up a 3.5mg capsule (of which much was stuck to the capsule itself) and took out enough so that about twice as much was left in the bottom of the pill, then I put a little back just in case.  I estimated this to be about .75mg as far as I could tell.  I split it up into 2 lines and paced them 30 minutes apart.  After the first, I began to shake and sweat a little bit but still nothing happened.  After the second this feeling subsided.  I rolled two joints and left for the party.  It was now midnight.



1:00  (T+7:30)  The immediate feeling I got from the two lines had subsided and I was mostly baseline, and fully disappointed.  Oh well, the party looked good so I decided to get stoned instead.  It was probably for the best.  My friend (who had taken no substance) and I sit down and smoke a spliff.  Immediately, I notice something very strange creeping up around me\ldots the world was changing, or I was changing--quite rapidly!  Finally I recognized the experience, it was a tryptamine rush!  I had had the same result before when I took LSD and MDMA at the same time and the LSD didn't kick in until about 4 hours after I took it when I smoked some pot and was plunged into the tryptamine universe very abruptly.  The total transition took about 10 minutes to peak, at which point I definately could say I was a full +2 or +3.



1:10-4:00  This is the time I spent imersed in the experience.  The best way I would describe it would be to say it's much like an LSD trip except with my head screwed on straight.  This is my first non-LSD or Psilocybin tryptamine experience, and I feel it defines the tryptamine buzz very well.  Everything not within direct sight or sounds seems irrelevant or nonexistant, and all of my peripheral vision seemed altered in an indescribable way.  It was almost as if I saw only freeze-frames and all the missing frames were filled in by solid colors.  For example, when I saw people dancing out of the corner of my eye, a rasing of the arm would make the whole arm look like it became a fan for a split second.  I guess this counts as tracers, but they were much different than those experienced on LSD, they were much more dense.  Also relative size and space perception was drastically altered.  As I looked straight ahead, people in my peripheral vision grew incredibly tiny and almost appeared to float up above me.



All my other senses were heightened.  I could not wear my wool sweater because it itched (it had never itched before, I was just being sensitive).  Cranberry juice made my whole face implode from the tanginess of it, as well as made my tongue feel like it was sticking to the roof of my mouth.  At one point in fact I began to taste a very indistinct bitterness in my mouth, after not eating or drinking anything in a long time.  Taste hallucinations?  This could have been a post-nasal drip but it occurred 5 hours after insuffilation.  It was interesting, in any case. With every motion of the body, I felt some kind of electricity.  I couldn't quite place it, and the feeling is hard to recollect after the experience, but the sensory and tactile sensations were much like being zapped by a bolt of electicity (in a good way).



Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this substance is its mental effects, and what it lacks.  I have always found that LSD in particularly tends to wear away the cover of that Pandora's box of emotions that is within us.  Those of us with thin covers of that box may have these unwanted emotions released, and the trip becomes a trip against one's inner demons.  I have fortunately never had a bad trip such as this, but I have always had the deep fear of one coming loose.  While on LSD, it's almost as if insanity itself could pop out of any corner, and I tend to divert some of my energy to keeping it at bay.  If this is not the case, there was always something to be afraid of, usually an irrational paranoid delusion.  The most striking property about this substance is that I felt absolutely none of that.  In fact, I had the hallucinatory feeling that my head was physically `screwed on straight,' as opposed to the LSD feeling of having my head float above me, and I felt extremely emotionally centered.  I also noticed that this substance had almost no spiritual or mystical quality that I know and love about some of the more classic psychedelics.  Somehow I feel the two are related.  My mind was still running at a mile-a-minute, thinking about all sorts of practical and logical (not mystical) things, and thinking quite clearly.



8:00 (T+14:30)  Five hours before, I was zapped at a +2/3.  I got home at 6:00 and fell asleep for about an hour and a half, and when I woke up I was still buzzing a little.  This gave me enough energy to wake up and stay up, but before I went to bed I was extremely worried about my class at 9:00.  As it turns out, I couldn't believe how amazingly down to earth I was at 9:00.  I was tired, but there was none of that horrible post-trip toxicity that I have with traditional psychedelics.  In fact, I felt refreshed.  I went through class extremely well (this was an intimate lab class with lots of teacher-student interaction and I passed with flying colors).  There was no way I could have faced class had I done LSD that night.



In retrospect, I would give this substance a very promising future.  As far as knowing my own brain chemistry is concerned, I would consider this to be far safer than either of the traditional tryptamines, and even MDMA (based on hangovers alone).  I do feel that we know alot more about what goes on within our own heads than we give ourselves credit for.  For example, I find that LSD is more toxic than Psylocybin, and the LSD `hangover' is significantly worse.  MDMA, in my case anyway, caused absolutely no adverse after-effects the first times I took it, and eventually as I became more experienced with the drugs the hangovers became gradually worse until it's not worth the high anymore.  Many friends of mine have had the same experience, and this is very consistent with current scientific findings, which relate brain toxicity with seratonin depletion.  While 5meo-AMT may exhibit adverse after-effects after more trials, as of now I consider it relatively less toxic.  In any case, the hangover is quite promising.

  

It is for this reason that I would consider the high to be a `Zapped' feeling.  Not only are the physical sensations much like getting zapped by a bolt of electricity (in a good way, of course), but because my emotional and psychological stability remained entirely intact.  It was as if only my physical and mental presence was zapped somehow, yet my inner self remained unaltered.  Overall, a very interesting sensation!  Thanks Sasha!
