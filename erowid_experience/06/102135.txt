First some notes on a prior experiences and then some notes on a particular experience, si?



A chemist friend graciously tested the material by NMR and ESI-MS and found it to be an inorganic salt of 6-APDB.



Prior experiences at 80 mg yielded clear ++ experiences without a strong independent character. These were generally positive if not glowing in mood and outcome and lasted 5-9 hours. With 100 mg taken at t+6 into a 13 mg 2C-E trip, I noticed a more balanced mood and a smile plastered across my face for the duration of the experience which ended around t+13 with sleep. The come-up was rough with nausea and a sense of being overwhelmed by lights. Once that passed, I was in and out of a hot tub so somatic effects were not pronounced beyond the hot tub being amazing. A hot tub is amazing to me even stone sober so I think that may have overridden the effects. I didn't spend any time dancing nor did I notice any particular hyperthermia.



Revisiting this at 100 mg with more than a month since last testing, I am only more confused.



I had just finished working for the day (on a day the office was nominally closed, no less) including presenting at an impromptu meeting that went passably well. My girlfriend had taken LSD and gone Christmas shopping while I was at work. We were to meet up when I finished with plans undecided beyond having dinner together.



At 3PM, t+0:00, I drank 100 mg dissolved with a cup of root beer. My last meal was a bowl of minestrone soup at 1PM and I had been too busy to eat my usual copious quantities of fruits during the day. I had limited body load during the come-up: one trip to the bathroom for a poo at t+0:30 and I was good to go. No hyperthermia. While sitting on the throne I wondered if I had nystagmus but it turned out to just be an irritatingly broken fluorescent ballast. I was able to move my car from one end of a parking lot to the other, though I would not have been excited to have to drive on an interstate freeway. Surface streets would have been navigable if an emergency came up.



During the first couple hours, some clear mind-expanding activity was present wherein elements of the mundane were rendered novel, such as a sunset and ocean waves. I found myself dancing to my headphones without self-consciousness or urgency while waiting for a bus though I did not experience the `electric skin' sensation I have found in the early come-up of MDMA. There was no remarkable visual distortion as I experience with 4-xO tryptamines. I was socially quieter as I've been with 2Cs, though this may have been a result of a stimulant suppressing my unmedicated ADD. I was smiling much more and laughing much easier as I've experienced with MDMA. Visits to stores such as IKEA and a local furniture warehouse were not overwhelming; just the opposite in fact. I was clearly euphoric but I was also in control of myself - I could stop myself from excitedly yammering because the point had been made. A great time, to be frank. A wonderful bonding experience with my partner, even if it wasn't particularly deep beyond our ordinary interactions.



At t+5:00 a cigarette helped me relax and enjoy the effects but that's true of damn near everything I try. I was subsequently able to enjoy eating some baked sweet potatoes and a cauliflower casserole which alleviated a slight headache I'd developed. When I finished eating I noticed that my heart rate was elevated and remained so for the remainder of the experience. Next time I'll have someone measure my blood pressure.



At t+8:00 my pupils were still dilated. After taking a shower and brushing my teeth, my girlfriend and I had lovely intercourse. My erection came on with ease and was mostly well-maintained throughout the experience. I found myself more interested in the contrasts between quantities of skin contact as well as being more gentle than usual. The orgasm was slightly more powerful but did overwhelm me. Sleep came easily after that. After about 8 hours of solid sleep, I'm hungry and ready to tackle some tasks (like breakfast \& coffee, hehe).



I just don't get it. Is it like a cross between MDA and MDAI? Between MDMA and MDA? MDMA and MDAI? About all I can really say at this point is that I've experienced activity between 80 and 100 mg and that it seems to last until around 8-9 hours.
