i first tried amphetamine in the form of the A.D.H.D. prescription drug of ritalin 5 years ago.  I was in 8th grade at the age of 14 or 15.  One of my friends was prescribed ritalin but he never took his pills.  So one day he gave one to me at school.  i believe it was a 20mg pill.  I instantly loved it.  The feeling and mind setting of joy and happiness followed by immense ambition to do something.  I found myself actually doing my school work and being so concentrated.  It wasn't long before I found myself doing it everyday.



Now, I've only done cocaine three or four times, it's not easily available where i live.  I love cocaine but am afraid of making it a habit, and since it's hard for me to get, I don't find myself doing it much.  Amphetamine, however, is widely available to me, especially since my friends who are prescribed it know they can make a buck off of me.



Five years down the road, I find it harder and harder to make it through everyday without that rush.  I've snorted, popped, smoked, and even once tried shooting it.  My preferred form is oral.  I'd recently been on a binge for the past four months, never going more than two or three days without at least 20mg.'s.  This might not sound like a seriouse addiction as compared to crack or cocaine, and maybe it isn't.  I've never pawned anything or done anything bad to get it.  I usually just spend all the money I can when it's available.  I'd gone ten days without it, the longest in four or five months, and I actually started feeling good without it again.  However, yesterday I took about 10mg's of Adderall and am now feining again.  I know that I'll always be addicted to amphetamine.  I only pray that I never come across methamphetamine because I know I'll instantly be addicted to that if it's readily available.  All that I want to know is, is there anyone else out there addicted to `amphetamine' and not `methamphetamine?'
