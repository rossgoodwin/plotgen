Clonazepam: One evil milligram at a time.

Things to keep in mind about myself before reading this document:

- I do not normally steal.

- I do not normally drive wreckless.

- I have very good gun saftey.

- I am a very down to earth person.



For a few months, I've been taking clonazepam. Not as directed of course. And I've had nothing but problems since I first started to take it. At first, I received a mild sedating effect from low doses ranging from 1-2mg, which soon led to more pill consumption to `increase' the euphoric feeling. But not even one week after I started to take the medication, I began to find myself crushing pills and snorting 1-2mg lines at a time, and that's when it all started.



About a month ago, I did between 8 and 12mg. I really couldn't tell you if it was either or inbetween. I have very little rememberance of what I did or how much I took. What I do remember are frightening images about some of the things I did while I was under clonazepam's spell. I began to think completely outside normal reasoning. I began to look at everything I saw as a potential way to make money. If I saw houses being built, immediatly I began to think of a way to steal material and tools from the job site, as well as how I would `sell it on eBay'. All rational thought went out the window. I remember driving to the store so I could steal a CD-Key to a video game I play called `Counter-Strike'. I didn't need the key, but at the time, I figured it was the right thing to do, and so we begin:



Since it had rained not long before I decided to go out on this adventure, the roads were pretty slick and even when I'm 100\% sober, I like to fishtail at intersections and out of my neighborhood. No harm, no foul. Well, on the clonazepam, I figured it would be a good idea to mimick what I had seen in movies when the `bad guys' are fleeing from cops and they fishtail hard at every turn. So, I came out of my neighborhood nearly doing a 180 and was on my way to the store.



At the very first traffic light I came to, which from my rememberance, was turning red as I went through it, I did between 3-5 360's in the MIDDLE of the intersection. I remember as I spun around once, this lady was looking at me probably with her mouth wide open in awe at what I was doing, and I remember smiling at her and spinning around again. I am STILL fearing the fact that every intersection here has cameras mounted on the traffic light bar, but claim that they're not active for issuing tickets. I gloom going to retreive the mail for the fear that one day I will go out to the mailbox and find a court summons or a plain 1,000 dollar fine for my wreckless behavior.



But going back to my venture to the store, I remember hitting soft curbs, (IE: median strips with soft curbs or no curbs at all) with my truck. I really am surprised I didn't get pulled for driving like I was shitfaced off a 5th of vodka. Thank god I didn't. God only knows what I would have done. Anyhow, I arrived and walked around the store pretending I wasn't about to steal something. Now as far as how well I pulled it off, I am not sure. All I know is, I didn't get caught and I didn't hear `Security scan department (fill in the blank)'.



When I first walked into the store, I had my cell phone in one hand, along with a razor blade in the other. I used the razor to cut open the circular sticker to prevent kids from opening the boxes, then I flipped through the manual for some reason, punched in the CD-Key into my cell phones address book; put the shit back in the box, and hung around to look at other games. I then went to another department and several more before purchasing some mints and a magazine with cash. I left and went back home. I would later give the CD-Key to someone online I knew, real useful eh?



Anyhow, that was just the start of my theiving stupor. I came home and did a few more lines of clonazepam only to find myself wanting to steal again. This time I was a lot more confident and I began to think up items I wanted. One thing came to my mind quickly, was a USB pen drive. So, with that in mind, I also thought it would be a good idea to bring a pellet gun with me. No clue why in hell I thought that at the time, none the less, an old 1970's .22 caliber air pistol was brought with me.



Along the way, I decided it would be best if I didn't do 360's in the intersections, but instead, shoot the street signs with the pellet gun. So, driving down the road at 9pm, I began to shoot the signs along the roadway. Normally, this wouldn't be THAT bad of an idea, I mean after all, it's only a pellet gun, right?. Wrong. I missed several times, several times which resulted in the pellet going into oncoming traffic. No clue whether or not it did any damage to any of the oncoming vehicles.



I also managed to accidentally shoot the gun inside my car, not once but twice. Twice into the passanger side door. I frantically tried to remove the `marks' on the door by rubbing the hell out of it. Of course, that did absolutely no good since the `marks' were actually half inch deep dents in the paneling on the passanger side door. After realizing it just was not going to come off, I paid it no mind. It was something I would worry about later. Besides, I was just arriving at another store. I had a `job' to do. I walked in again with my cell phone out in one hand, and a razor cupped in the other.



I walked through a few departments before I went to the electronics department and began my ignorance. I saw the 128mb drive, the 256mb and then what I thought were the 512mb drives. I picked one up and walked away from the department with it since there was a camera staring me right in the face down that particular isle. I walked around the store pretending to be on a cell phone and pretending to be laughing when ever I felt the paranoia of being `watched' setting over. I figured this way it would look like I was just another normal everyday shopper.



Well, after looking at the George Foreman grills, I decided it was time to razor the plastic packaging and get what I came for. Since my quordination was so off, I wound up slicing part of the rubber capping on the pen drive off. I remember thinking to myself, fuck, I have to take this, I can't go back to the department and pick up another one. So I did. I took it slices and all. I also for some reason, said into the phone `Oh so she's home now?' and then walked back over to the electronics department, placed the sliced packaging BACK where I got it, and then left. When I got home, I realized I had picked up a damn 64mb drive, not a 512mb drive. And not only did I get the wrong drive, I also cut it all to shit. It still works, but it was definitely not worth the risk I went through to get it.



The day after I took the clonazepam, I was still high. I was out in my garage messing around with something, when I fell over an old toilet we had sitting out there. Instead of catching my balance, and standing up normally. I fell over the toilet, and it crashed to the concrete below it, breaking it into several pieces. My parents were pissed needless to say. Also, I was told I sat down for dinner that night and was very mean and aggressive with my mother. I also said some things to her that scared her enough to sleep with her door locked that night. The next day, I was confronted about my behavior which I had no rememberance of at all. I completely blacked out. I was told everything I ate, everything I said, and everything I did. I had absolutely no rememberance of it at all even still. 



After experiencing that and looking back upon it, I will not be using clonazepam recreationally in high doses without someone else present to keep my mind from wandering into a criminal state. I am VERY lucky I didn't wind up in jail or worse. I have done several benzo's in high dosages before. Some even with alcohol, none caused the disturbing behavioral changes I experienced on clonazepam. I read up on the medication after I did this (very stupid) finding out that behavioral changes are one of the possbile `side effects' of the drug. Along with plenty of other side effects, such as aggression and poor balance. I seemed to experience quite a few of the negative side effects.
