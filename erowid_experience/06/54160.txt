I'm taking L-tyrosine 1,5g, some OTC Zinc tablets and Cipralex (escitalopram) 5mg daily.



On that evening, my friend P called me to visit him, and I hadn't anything to do, so I went to see him. We live on a college hostel, so I arrived a few minutes later.



21:30 T +0:00 I grind 3 pills of Tramal 200 SR in a folded sheet of paper with a beer bottle. The powder is coarse, I think it's because of the sustained release formulation of the pills. I swallow the powder (pretty bitter, but it causes no nausea) drink some tap water and wait. I tried tramadol before, it was in SR tablets too, and I took 300mg and felt almost nothing.



I have no opioid tolerance (no opiates in last 3 months) but I experimented with codiene 6 months ago and felt nothing even with the dose 200 mg, so I gave it up. I hoped a sufficient dose of tramadol will help me feel the pretty and warm opiate world, about which I heard from friends.



My other two friends took tramadol too. P (former heroin user - about 6 years ago he stopped) took 1000 mg and J took 400 mg in capsule form. They both smoked a lot of quite potent weed and we started to chat about everything.



22:10 T +0:40 P reports, that he is starting to feel it. I felt a little buzz maybe, but nothing intense yet.



22:35 T +1:05 P looks really influenced by the pills, his eyes are closing and he is walking around the room with no aim. I just smoked my last cigarette, so I go down to the shop to buy some. I feel a bit dizzy and a little uncoordinated, but nothing intense. I checked my pupils before - no miosis. The way down is a little uncomfortable, I feel a bit strange and have no mood for unknown people, but buying cigarets is no problem.



22:45 T +1:15 My eyelids are heavy, and I have a strange feeling as if my eyes were shaking. Maybe nystagmus? I feel rather stimulated than on opiates, so i decide to take another 100 mg in capsule form.



23:15 T +1:45 J is nervous and irritated. He seems not to like this kind of experience. P has strong miosis and is enjoying this state. He tells us stories about his feelings on heroin and that this substance is similiar, but lacks the most intense and exiting part of heroin feeling. I think it lacks much more, so I take another 300 mg.



23:30 T +2:00 I feel a bit nauseous, so I lie on the bed and everything is ok again. I feel that my body is relaxed, but nothing especially pleasant. Mentally I'm a little confused, but not as much as P, who forgets the topic after he says 3 sentences.



00:30 T +3:00 No change in my state. Still lying on the bed, smoking cigarets, and can't stand up, because of the nausea. Nystagmus irritates me and the little confusion is still here.



01:30 T +4:00 I'm starting to feel tired, really tired. I checked my eyes the whole night and observed no miosis. I decide that this state is not worth to be awakes for me, so I go to my room and fall asleep around 2:00.



The hangover day:

I woke up around 10:00 (T +12:30) and felt really sick. I was sweating like never before, so i took a shower. The nausea I felt was really strong, but I had to force myself to vomit. After that I felt a little better, but couldn't do anything. Just lie on bed and wait. I was really exhausted. My eyelids were very heavy and sometimes I couldn't focus my eyes on one spot. During the whole day I fell asleep many times, but just for few minutes. I had a lot of strange dreamlike visions, but only in my room. (For example I tought I was writing an sms and woke up with the phone on my chest.) I coudln't eat anything, I just sipped tap water whole day and sweated like a pig. My whole body was itchy, but I still had no miosis. The hangover ended around 20:30 (T +23:00).



Conclusion: 1000 mg was definitely an overdose for unexperienced user like me. The other problem in my opinion was the sustained release formulation of the pills. I don't think that the substance did liberate as it would from normal gelatine capsules even when I crushed them, so the full effect of the drug started later and was longer, as normal. But I can't explain the absence of opiate feelings during the experience. My subjective feelings were very weak and physiological effects absent. I don't think, that L-tyrozine, zinc or citalopram could block the effects of tramadol. I didn't try the analgetic effect, maybe I would see the difference, but usually I don't like to hurt myself:)



I don't think I will try tramadol again.
