 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# 



Once when I was 15, I was hanging out with some people and someone pulled out a silver spray can.  The brand label on it said `Ethyl Jaz' and in smaller letters it said `Ethyl Cloride.' Someone said it was like poppers, which I had never done.  They took turns spraying it on a towel and then holding it to their faces.  One girl actually put the sprayed part of the towel in her mouth, because she said it was better that way.  I tried it, and started giggling immediately after I inhaled it.  Then I wanted another huff, and another and another and another, but soon someone took it away from me.  



I learned it was sold at a certain bar.  I went to the bar, which was well-known as a hangout for gay men who liked leather \& motorcycles.  There was a boutique upstairs that sold leather accessories \& sex toys.  They had little bottles of `VCR head cleaner' and cans of Ethyl Jaz in a glass case.  I bought a can of Ethyl Jaz.  It was very expensive for me, something like \$25 for 2 ounces.



I took it home and started huffing it.  At first it seemed like it was just something fun, it made me feel giddy.  As soon as a hit wore off, I wanted to do another one.  Then instead of just sniffing a sprayed rag, I started putting the rag inside my mouth and inhaling through it, like I had seen the girl at the party do.  This method was incredibly more intense.



After taking a huff, I would immediately lose my vision.  All was grey except for an oval-shaped pulsating green colored light ahead of me, and a little above me, and I would hear noises that sounded like the video game Pac-Man.  I felt conscious, and yet I was completely engulfed by these sensations.  I felt that I was elevating, and getting closer to the green oval, which held a wonderful mystic truth for me, if I could only get there.



Then I would regain consciousness.  I had felt a sense of awareness during the huffing, but I fell off my chair and fell on the floor.  So despite my feelings of being aware, bodily it was like passing out.  When I came to, I felt numb and confused, and I immediately wanted to do another hit.  Partly I wanted more to keep being `high,' but I also felt that if I could just do a big enough hit, I would understand the secret message of the green light and be cosmically enlightened.  The notion of `cosmic' or `mystic' truth did not occur to me at the time.  This is just the best way I can explain it.



I kept huffing, and at one point I believe I lost all consciousness for a period of time.  I was confused, so I don't know how long I passed out for.  I had a bad headache, but I wanted to keep huffing, and attain the elusive universal truth that seemed so close at hand.  Finally, I reached it.  I received the holy message and it clicked in my head with an awesome understanding.  It wasn't in words, but in pure thought that I felt had been delivered to me by a higher power.  The message was that I was destroying my brain and I needed to stop.



I pondered this for a bit.  Then I finished huffing the remainder of the can, which was almost gone by then.  I did not get anywhere close to the previous feelings.  I felt compelled to keep huffing, but I didn't feel like I was doing something enlightening anymore.  I didn't use ethyl chloride again.  Partly because it was an intense scary experience (and I thought, maybe dreadfully wrong, because of the message I got), and partly because it was expensive.  Alcohol \& LSD were so much cheaper, and a lot of times people would smoke their pot with me so it was free for me.



I tried poppers a couple times after that, and it was sort of a `head rush,' but it came nowhere near the intense feelings of imminent spiritual awakening I had felt with the ethyl chloride.  I thought that whoever had said that the Ethyl Jaz was `like poppers' was a fool.  I didn't use inhalents at any other time.



I kept using drugs for 5 more years.  Sometimes, after smoking a lot of pot, I would get a little glimmer of that feeling of knowing a cosmic message -- the same message that I was destroying my brain, and I needed to stop.  But the desire to get high was strong, and I chose not to heed the message.  When I was 20, I got clean.  I felt that my ability to stop using substances, despite the seemingly uncontrollable urges to use them, was a spiritual intervention.  I felt some of the `message' feelings during my early days and weeks of being clean, but this time it was that I was finally heeding the message 5 years after first hearing it.



I'm now 30 and have been completely abstinent from drugs and alcohol for 10 years.  I still look back at Ethyl Jaz as a spiritual experience.  `Stop getting high' may seem like an improbable spiritual message to get from getting high.  But if I hadn't stopped, I believe there's a strong chance I would have permanently damaged my brain or liver, or died.  So it was an important message for me.
