So my cousin came across a this substance called 2cc NBOMe. I had no idea what this substance was when he told me about it nor did I know how much to take. So I proceeded to pour out a little more then a pinky length. I snorted this line in the bathroom and it didnt hit me right away I had asked him if he knew anything about it and he said he didnt just that it was some crazy psychedelic he had came across and had yet to try it. 



About 30 minutes went by and I got this LSD type stomach feeling. It was time for him to take me to the train station back to the OC so we walked down his stairs and everything  turned into a water type substance I don't think I could really say there was even a come up it just kinda hit me really hard all at once.  We continued to walk to his car and everything  was very bright and colorful kind of like a pink blue type color I like to use the term blurple from taking DMT a couple months before. As we got in his car the whole dashboard started to morph and melt along with everything else inside and outside the car.  Once we got  on the freeway I started hearing a wimping type noise like if you've ever done dust off  it sounded a lot like that.  This continued through the rest of the trip too. So we get close to the train station and I failed to mention that I hadn't told him I did it yet cause I didn't want him to flip out. 



He stopped at a local liquor store and went in to get me some cigs and left me in the car. When he came back I was in a full sweat and pretty much freaking out. I couldn't really understand what was going on everything around me continued to get worse and worse I looked at him and then I told him. I said ``I'm not usually one to bitch out on psychedelics cause I love me but I'm bitching out now I think I took too much of that 2cc stuff' and he  started to panic. He asked how much I had did and I told him `a little over the length of my pinky'' immediately I could tell he was worried. He said are  you sure it wasn't DMT I said yeah I know wat DMT is like theres no way its been going on for about 45 minutes. He said ok u can just stay the night you will be fine. He had failed to tell me I probably took about 80-200 hits of it. He said ``don't worry we can just drive around and u can have a good trip'' I said ``no I don't think you understand this is bad everything is melting and I'm hearing loud noises, lets just go back to your house ok''.  So we proceeded to drive back home. 



On the drive back I tried to just stay calm and it just kept getting crazier I started to see a desert with wild animals running in the horizon it was quite beautiful to be honest. I saw this one lion in particular and he was staring at  me he started running closer and closer as it got about 2 feet it morphed into a Subaru and started to race us as we got off the freeway to make a left turn it flipped over off the overpass. As it hit the ground it popped into pink cotton candy like a kettle corn of popcorn along with everything else around me and continued to grow out of my body like hair. I started to pull it out asking my cousin wat it was like he was seeing this too he said whats what I said its coming out of your mouth. He laughed and continued to keep driving we got into his garage and told me to wait there. He was going to go get some milk with sugar and a pillow. As he left I thought he was still in the car and everything around us was a white background. As I was sitting there I thought he threw some cocaine on me and these cops ran up to us and he kept trying to tell me to hide it (he was gone at this point to remind you). They walked up to us  and said are you guys doing any drugs.  



At  at this point their bodies and my body's turned into metal and I looked at my cousin who wasn't even there and from the outside in his body was peeling like sheets of metal and the noises turned into loud screeching noises.  Once his body was done peeling then it was my turn and before I started peeling in big letters in this white room I was in it said END OF THE WORLD.  As I started to peel I knew something bad was happening to me. My cousin told me he was only gone for about two minutes and he came back and was trying to make me drink the milk with sugar and I couldn't drink he gave me a cig and I couldn't even smoke it and he said I kept saying `` I don't know what I'm doing'' over and over and over. 



About five minutes after he was trying all these things I was going into a full seizure so he got in the car and drove as fast as he could to the hospital about five minute away. He was holding me with one arm and driving with the other hand saying ``Please don't die please don't die''. Around the last intersection my whole body went limp I had no pulse. He got to the hospital saying my cousins dead my cousins dead. The security asked what was going on and he said an overdose. The security guard told him to stay calm and take any drugs out of my of my pocket. I had about an eighth of marijuana on me. They induced me into a coma and I'm pretty sure the trip was still going on for the four days I was in a coma. I don't remember any of my trip during the coma except the last part where I had walked up a cloud of stairs guessing it was the famous ``stairway to heaven'' and I got to the top and waited at this gate. Some kind of being had walked up to it probably the higher power of my understanding and it shook its head and pointed back down. When I got to the bottom there was my cousin. Some words came out of his mouth backwards wrapped around me from the point of me to him was what had seemed to be about 100 yards. Once the word wrapped around me I realized it said DMT not abbreviated. Before it got to him he said `and that's why they call it DMT' and snapped. The words went into his snap and I woke up out of the coma seeing all of my family there which I hadn't seen in months. 



This was an experience I'm glad I had in a way not the fact that it could have killed but that now I know don't sniff things we don't know about kids.
