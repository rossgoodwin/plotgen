Hi, first of all I would like to state that this was my first trip ever --- off any drug, much less 708mg. Do I suggest starting with such a high dose with no previous experience? No. Did I have an enjoyable time doing it? Yes. Most people report nausea at around T + 45, but I never had any nausea.



I dosed approximately 708mg DXM at about 11:00 P.M. the night of my trip. The source of the DXM was a bottle of Robitussin Maximum Strength Cough (NOT COUGH AND COLD!!!) which contains 15mg DXM per ml of cough syrup.



Seting:

My room that contains several blacklights, trippy blacklight posters, a mirror ball, a disco light, a fog machine, a white and a red strobe light, a fibre optics light, and the usuals such as computer, TV, etc. Parents not home, house to myself.



Medical history:

17 Year old male

Diagnosed with Paranoia, extreme sensitivity, Social Anxiety Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, OCD, Bi Polar, possible Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthiritis, fatty liver, and clinical depression. The 2 weeks prior to my trip had mentally been fairly uneventful, with some good things and some bad things happening. On the night of the trip, I was in a great mood and was excited that I was about to have my first trip.



Current meds:

Klonopin(1mg/day), Wellbutrin, Zoloft(150mg/day), Vitamin E(2 caps./day)



The Trip:



11:00pm: I down a bottle of Robitussin Max Strength (708mg DXM). To my surprise, the taste of the syrup wasn't unpleasnt to me, and it wasn't thick. I was able to down the whole 8oz bottle in seconds. I didn't feel the need to chase it with a liquid, but I figured that it would be a little less harmful to my kidneys if I drank some water after that, so I ingeseted approx 42oz of water over the course of about 10 minutes.



11:30pm (T +30): I notice a mood lift, general euphoria, music (especially repetitive techno\ldots  but really any kind) sounds awesome. I have lots of deep thoughts, and am 100\% pleased with my life. This continues throughout the whole trip. Smoked approx 5 grams of High Quality bud.



12:00pm (T +60): I repeat over and over to myself how much I love this drug\ldots  and I am still 1 1/2 hrs away from the best part. I change the music to the kind that I enjoy most (southern rap\ldots  cash money, no limit, etc) and it also sounds great. No other major events until T +150.



1:30pm (T +150): I feel that I am tripping now, and pretty damn hard. I don't know how this compares to acid or shrooms, because I have never done either. I have some OEVs that mainly consist of flashes/streaks of lights, and rings around lights, and some CEVs also (like lucid dreams when I close my eyes). The trip is mainly mental for me. I'm not thinking of anything in particular, or gaining any new views on life or any of the stuff that you hear commonly, but I was definately tripping. Stuff seems funnier, and much more ammusing. I have a general feling of well-being. I feel like I am the only thing that matters in the world, and nothing else has control over me.



2:00pm (T +180): I am having considerately more hallucinations than 30min ago, but still the same type. All of a sudden, I have a strange feeling that I can telepathically communicate with my friends. They are `talking' to me from 20+ miles away, but I am not listening to it, nor do I talk back. I can't remember what they said because it didn't really seem all that abnormal. Just a really awesome feeling. While this was happening I felt really comfortable and special, complete bliss.



2:10pm (T +190): I decide to see what walking around feels like, and to see if my pupils are dialated or constricted. I stand up and almost fall instantly. My body feels like a ton of bricks and feels like Jello at the same time. Wow. This takes a minute of getting used to, then I can wobble into the bathroom. I look into the mirror and see me\ldots  or is it? It seemed like the person in the mirror was me, but the `real' me\ldots  not the person I was right now. This was an extremely pleasurable experience. I look into my eyes to see if they are dialated, but I can not tell since I am tripping. If I move a little bit away from the mirror they get as small as a pinpoint. If I move close to the mirror, they get very large (75\% probably). I sttod in front of th emirror for a while admiring the pores in my face, and the intricate designs in my eyes. After that I decide to go to the kitchen and get something to eat. I choose something that actually takes preperation, and for some reason it was REALLY hard. I spilled stuff everywhere and was having trouble standing it felt like. I had to make my way around the kitchen by holding onto the counter. Throughout this time, I had a strong urge to go lay on my couch.. mmmm\ldots  comfortable. But my food wasn't ready. I spent the next 5 minutes fixing my food, and then it was such a relief\ldots  I could actually go lay down nd watch a movie. It actually felt like a reward. So I walked over to my couch (took a couple minutes because I had to hold onto stuff to walk.. not sure if I was really having trouble or just imaging it). I lay down on my couch and look to see what's on TV\ldots  500+ channels, and all shit. The only thing that I thought would be cool to watch was Harry Potter because I was tripping. This is something I would nomally ever watch, but I figured what the hell. I ordered it on PPV and ate my food (which I got all over my shirt) while I was waiting for it to come on. When it came on, it was impossible for me to follow the movie. All I was noticing was some weird ass fucking dwarves and shit, and the accent Harry Potter had heh.It really tripped me out to see all these dwarves and witches and all kind of other weird shit. It was interesting and intriguing. I kept getting distracted by other things and wasn't paying attention to the movie so I turned it off. I just looked around my living room at awe in how unfamiliar stuff was. I knew where I was and knew it was familiar territory, it just had an unfamiliar feel to it. None of this was unpleasnt. I laid on the couch for about 16 minutes more, just chiling and being hella comfortable. After that, I went and laid in my bed and thought about the weirdest things while I drifted off to sleep. This was the most comfortable and restful sleep I have ever experienced. All of my dreams were lucid, really fucked up, and I remembered a lot of them.

I can't recall all right now, but I will try.



Dream \#1: I was in an unfamiliar house\ldots  there was some computer nerd in it and we were in his room. I don;t think he did any drugs, becuase I think I asked him. After that, all I remember of the dream was the word soccer\ldots  nothing else.



Dream \#2: I was at my old school and one of the teachers was talking shit to me and I was like fuck off slut. She took me to the principal's office, to whom I said the same thing. They got really pissed off at me but for some reason they wouldn't suspend me. Then, I did something malicious to the teacher's car or something but I pretty much forgot what happened.

Dream \#3-???: Don't remember any of these, but they were all very intense and `real'.



Summary of trip:

My whole trip was enjoyable, not a bad or terrifying moment (except for a few minutes I couldn't remember what it felt like to be normal, and if I would ever return to normality.)

Throughout the trip, I felt like everything was fake and unfamiliar. The only thing that mattered was me, but every now and then I would realize that there are so many authority figures in my country that have complete power over our lives. It kind of seemed like I was everything, and nothing at all. I have heard this referred to as ego death, but I'm not sure if that is what I had. It was still pleasurable. I had no nausea or bad thoughts whatsoever throughout the trip, but I figured I would because of my mental condition.



Out of all drugs I have tried (not many\ldots  Morphine, Xanax, Klonopin, Valium, Cannabis, DXM), this was by far the most pleasurable. If I cold give this trip a rating, it would be a 10/10.



The hangover:

I find the DXM hangover to be much worse if you fall asleep while tripping. If you do, expect to hardly be able to walk for the first 2 hrs after you wake up, and to feel very `throwed off' from the night before all day. 

However, my DXM hangover was much milder when I stayed up through the whole trip and part of the comedown. When I woke up in the morning, I had minor `sea legs' but other than that I could easily function properly.

My hangovers may have been attributed to my daily dose of Wellbutrin, but I am not 100\% sure.



My thoughts on DXM:

I do not think DXM is for everyone. I have read that approximately 1/3 of the people that try DXM like it. I suggest not doing it unless you are intelligent, mature, psychologically stable (which I was not\ldots  but it didn't bother me), do not have much experience with other drugs, are prone to panicking and overreacting, or in an uncomfortable environment. From what I hear it is much easier to have a bad trip on DXM than it is on LSD. I do recommend having a trip sitter for a DXM trip, just to calm you down if something does happen, but it is not a necessity. I believe that your decision making is altered extremely while under the influence of DXM and most other drugs. As always, play it safe and everything will be fine\ldots  you have a very slim chance of self injury or death on moderate DXM doses of up to 1000mg. Above that may be pushing it.



Warnings:

Do not ingest DXM if you have any tasks to complete or places to be in the next 12-15 hours. Do not use any cough syrup other than ones that have DXM as the ONLY active ingredient. NEVER USE CORICIDIN COUGH AND COLD OR YOUR TRIP COULD BE YOUR LAST ONE. I do not suggest ingesting over 1500mg of DXM, due to the intensity of my 708mg trip. Although there is no official LD50 for DXM, I believe it to be around 3000mg. Last but not least, NEVER drive while on DXM unless you think you can drive under the influence of a case of beer plus a few hits of LSD. Even then, don't drive. Use common sense and responsibility and DXM has potential to be one of the most enjoyable experiences of your life\ldots  it was mine.



Peace,

      ThrowedOff
