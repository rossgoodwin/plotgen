I'd like to share a \_very\_ intense experience i had yesterday whilst experimenting (quite heavily, i might add) with DXM. Around 3 months ago, i'd pursued research into usage of DXM, especially into one state of consciousness known on the DXM faq as `Plateau Sigma'. This seemed to be a very delusional and unpleasant state, but I was adiment that I would pursue it, just to see if I (a self named, and externally named subgenius) could control my mind, psyche and consciousness whilst in this state.



Here's how I dosed (note: i didn't follow the faq):



T+00h: ingested 500mg white (foul tasting) powder in vodka (1 shot)

waited awhile. after around 30min i felt first effects, at which time I took a gelcap containing 350mg more dxm. i took another dose later, but i'll get to that in a minute



I sat on my sofa in my room, having the odd cigartette and playing with my guitar (btw,  this is very satisfying in conjunction with cannabis). at roughly the 3hr point, i snapped out of my guitar / cigarette trance, realising that i was struming away absolute bullcrap instead of trying to perfect `riders on the storm'. fair enough. the world around me after this trance was so utterly alien it's really impossible to describe.



Imagine this: i'm around 10 inches tall, with really long legs and the room around me is the size of what literally seems like the Sydney opera house. in front of me is a coffee table, which although was right in ront of me seemed quite far away. I had the sensation that there was now no wall or sofa behind me and that at any given moment i could fall into nothingness, so i had to constantly check. there was nothing outside this little world i was in at the moment, reality beyond the room seemed incomprehensible and all that was there was what i thought was infinity. space and time, and even life itself would disappear in a nanosecond were i to leave this room. thanatos at my door, and a black hole behind me, how comforting. then i realised that my thoughts were completely delusional, so i snapped out of it and looked around again. still the same, but this time i realised it was my room and i was safe there. ok.



i'd prepared one final dose for myself on my bedside table, as another vodka shot (650mg DXM), and a paracetamol lying next to it (thoughts become more delusional as body temp rises) so down that went and i lay on my bed for a while. i sort of dozed off, \& went to a world of mine which i keep in my mind for psychedelic trips. i was there, the place was vast \& white, full of buildings, the floor a conveyor belt of geometric patterns and the sky a green entrance to the infinity. my quest this time was simply to explore as far as i could before awakening. i had the advantage over the world this time. my body needed no control and i had neither the inhibitions of emotion or pain.



Turning the corner i encountered what i thought was the god-entity. this, i thought was the entity ruling absolutely over the different realities and as such had unquestionnable power over me, my life and everything, everywhere. darkness came and went, different realities passed - planets were brought to me and disappeared just as quickly, full of different ecosystems, different florae and faunae, culture and religion. just as i got a glimpse into a new and wonderful world, another would appear, equally as intriguing. i now had no body, no soul and no attributes to my name. i was powerless to go forward from this point and my only choice was to observe what was happening around me.



My vision skipped and i was back to my bedroom. i looked at myself, then struggled to see the time on the clock. 1pm, four and a half hours since first ingestion. that meant, to my relief that I'd come back to what was my world, the world I was comfortable and familiar with. no, that was wrong. I looked out of my window. everything was different, the trees outside, the neighbourhood and people i saw were all monstrous. these realities i had seen were now combined, and no matter how i tried to bring myself back to reality, it stayed the same. oh crap. i broke down in tears, thinking the world would stay like that, and i'd be trapped with monsters, my emotions and my personality consumed by this god-entity. whereas i was a god of my own inner reality, this one was of far vaster knowlege, and in his eyes i was pathetic, so he took away what was me and replaced it with a dead, roaming soul.



I went back to my bed, and just lay down, drifting in and out of consciousness, thinking ` will i drift like this forever? at least i'm peaceful this way, so i'll stay like this'.



At some point i fell fully into sleep, having very weird dreams, and awoke around 12 hours later, feeling very dry, and very hungry, i just sat on my bed, lit a cigarette and thought about what happened. i felt so glad to be where i was, to be smoking this cig, to be myself once again and that my friends, family and girlfriend were all out there, not knowing this state. I'd been given a new lease of life and wasn't going to abuse it, and to this day i've felt better about the world around me, about myself, and about the people around me. i think it's about as close as i ever got to a near-death experience, and no other drug i've tried has had nearly as profound an effect on me as DXM. but there was a very good and justified reason that dr. Shulgin described this and similar drugs as `delusional anaesthetics'. beware.



peace to you all, and remember, do not visit plateau sigma. i was stupid to think i could keep myself in a place like that.
