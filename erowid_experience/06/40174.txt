After the xmas holidays I decided to regulate my sleeping patterns using Melatonin. I was also inclined to use Melatonin as I hoped it would allow me to have a better nights rest, having been waking up multiple times during the night previously. 



I had taken it maybe 6 months earlier as I wanted to experience more vivid dreams. As it happened, though I did experience this I felt it not worth the interrupted sleep I suffered from waking up during the majority of the lucid dreams I encountered.



So anyway, the most recent time I have been using Melatonin I have had two fairly disruptive experiences. What happened the first time, a week or so ago, is that I woke up during the night, and attempted to get back to sleep - only to find myself lucid dreaming as soon as I seemingly fell asleep. Now, these dreams  seemed to originate from very basic parts of my subconscious, for example one of the dreams was of myself in a scene at work, looking through a guide on something as I usually do to check certain things, and I read a part saying `number must be wrote in roman numerals'. It was extremely short, but it was hugely vivid, and lucid. Now I forgot about this dream, until I was at work where I was asked a question about the same part, in which I explained to the colleague that among other things, she must write the number in roman numerals. Now, this isn't actually in the guide at work\ldots and when thinking hard on why I would have thought the guide had this written I managed to remember that in fact, I had dreamt this. 



My analysis of this is that when I do this part of work, I do write it in roman numerals personally, though it isn't by any means essential, so the dream must've been a represntation of that part of my subconscious - but in dreaming it so vividly, in such light sleep (in that I had barely dropped off) and then forgetting the dream - it actually became a part of my memory.



Another issue was that in waking up one night, attempting to get back to sleep I actually got stuck in the same dream each time, and woke up each time - what must've been 3/4 times. It was a dream where I felt like I was being pulled up by 2 hands swooping down from somewhere high above, from my bed - it was lucid, I was saying `For fuck sake' in my mind because it aggrivated me rather than scaring me. I was pulling back as hard as I could to stay in my bed instead of being pulled up - each time I succeeded in staying down I woke up. This happened 3/4 times, the same dream the instant I fell asleep. 



I've stopped taking it now, as I didn't fancy any repeats of the first issue I wrote about. The second one was mostly aggrivating but I suppose slightly interesting - I could feel the hands underneath me, and I felt almost awake - thought it still was definitely a dream.
