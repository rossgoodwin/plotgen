I have had many experiances with these powerful plants in the past. Peyote has remained a personal friend of mine on this path of shamanism. We use a majority of herbs for various reasons, mostly for healing, because of this, Peyote and me have remained good friends. I have had close encounters with death before. It is a spirit which I highly respect for its power and whatever is touched by it. 



I smoked 5-meo-dmt with friends in a nearby town. Everyone was partying and using drugs. There was cocaine, adderall, marijuana, one man who was there, who also had the cocaine, had a substance which he aquired and apparantely purified from a toad. He told me you had to squeeze the toad to make the venom come out, and that the venom was very powerful. He used the term `that is one powerful fucking drug right there'. 



After talking about it for a while, I was intrested to try it. I was curious as to what revelence it had to shamanic use. He applied a white-thick-powder with cannabis and urged me to smoke it. I did this and the first thing I noticed was an extreme dizziness, vertigo. I had an extreme urge to stand up and when I did, I could not see. There was nothing but clear white light. I had realized at this point, that I had came into the same world I always do without any use of drugs, without my own intent, and I could not escape or come back. It was a terrifying feeling of losing control. 



The world is indescrible. I had visions of snakes, as usual, the snake is my totem animal. It was coiled in a ball around my chest, and was related to my own fear. I began to stretch my spirit and move around. At this point, I was fearing for my own life, my own survival. The room was full of negative spirits, negative energy, it was too many spirits, too much work to do. I locked myself in a room, a closet, where no windows were, where nothing could get in, in a place where no one could ever go. It was the only thing I could do, this was a state of emergency to me. I felt death strike me and felt myself start to die. 



The only thing I could do was give up. It was the only solution I could find that gave way of the fear. I told myself I was not afraid to die, and was willing to be taken. I know all too well how beautiful this universe is, my heart is as open as the sky. I got up and left the room without dismissing myself and began to walk down the street. I wasn't coming down, but I was feeling immensely better to be out of there and go wherever I wanted. 



I wondered aimlessely. I avoided contact with all souls, as I could feel thier shit as ever as before and it made me ill. I was not in a position of authority at this point to overcome negativity, I was at deaths mercy, and had my own shit to deal with here. There was no time to waste with petty issues here.



I focused a great deal of my attention on the sky. Jupiter was rising in the east, the moon slightly to its left, Aries(my sun sign) right behind it. I felt a sense of pride and awe, looking at this beautiful planet centered right in the same place where I had first seen myself slowly descending from it, into my own body for the first time. In this scene, I rememered it as clear as ever-and my first breath of life, of this world, that I had taken. There was nothing else to say, nothing else to do. Everything was as it should be and I was so full of bliss, so full to the brim, that I was overflowing with energy. I had reached meditation without any intent. 



I had no desire to return to that house. To their drugs, thier partying, thier lack of awareness. I have no condemnation, but it was not my world-I had only gone there so I could experiance this. I felt my power return, my own will, my own intent. My ego returned slowly, and I cannot say rather it was pleasant, or unpleasant. I had established control again, but there was no need at this point, I was protected by the great spirit who deeply loves me and every living thing, breathing thing that is part of it. I was in heaven and here at the same time. 



It seems the two could not co-exist, but I was suprised at how wrong I could be. Everyday new things, new knowledge, and new revelation suprise me, and this is what I live for, and to show it to as many people as I can. This is why I'm writing this report. Not for research reasons, but to point my finger at this indescrible great spirit that loves all of us. I don't care what people think, I know the truth now, and I want everyone to see how beautiful it really is. 



The drug 5-meo-dmt is a very powerful spirit. I would be very careful with it. There are dangers. I should have prepared myself to enter into the lions den. I had to respect and accept death or I would be overcome with fear. I had to get over my own internal fear of losing control. And not only should I have brought knowledge, but I should also have brought power to overcome being drawn from my own power. You dont want to go into a poker game and bid all of your money without knowing how to play. Learn the ways of life, feel your power, and use your power to remember the end-and not the means. It's very easy to forget, especially around other people. As you may be\ldots
