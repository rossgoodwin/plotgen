I've had a little 100mg bag of 2C-B-Fly sitting in my stash for a while now, and until last night, I had no real desire to try it.



About half way through a lazy Friday afternoon, I decided I wanted to give something new a try. I wasn't really in the mood for going out, so I figured I'd either go for some mushrooms or the Fly. I can't remember how I concluded that the 2C-B-Fly would be the better choice, but I'm glad I did.



Quick rundown of my previous drug use and experience - lots of weed, 2C-I, 2C-T-7, 2CB and mushrooms. I'd had a very nasty experience with 2C-I at 25mg about 5 weeks ago, although I had tried a low dose of 2C-B since then and had no problems at all. 



This was a solo trip, although I spent the latter part of it downstairs watching TV with one of my housemates.



At 7.30pm I carefully measured 15mg of 2C-B-Fly out and mixed it with water. I had eaten a fairly big meal 2 and half hours ago, although was feeling surprisingly hungry.

Felt a bit of nausea after drinking it\ldots  the chemically bitter taste made me shudder, although I get that with all RCs.



+0.10 - Slight tingling sensation down my spine. Probably a placebo. 



+0.15 - Head feels strange - sensation of pressure on my forehead and neck. Goosebumps on arms despite it being very warm in the room.



+0.20 - Smoked a tiny bit of weed to relax.



+0.30 - First visuals spotted\ldots  only had a tiny bit of weed but it really accelerated this. CEVs colorful. Slight bending / warping and `flickering' OEVs. Hard to look at the monitor - looks like it's flickering (like when you film a PC monitor) and is a lot brighter than normal. Watching simpsons and the sound is crystal clear. Marked pupil dilation. 



+0.45 - man this is really nice, screen is waving as I type, raining colorful snowflakes. feels like my head is warping round in a circle. Tracers linger beautifully. Soft psychedelic blur over everything\ldots  everything has rounded rainbow edges. Marked time dilation\ldots  this song has been going on for as long as I can remember. 



+1.00 - lava lamp shadow is dancing\ldots  really wavy screen, typing is very hard. Fingers feel strange pushing the keys - as if they aren't mine. Lovely bright, colorful visuals. Beautiful CEVs\ldots  like star rockets on a night sky, exploding with puffs of glitter. 



+1.30 - Real time dilation. Past 5 minutes seemed like at least half an hour. 



15mg is a real mind bender, couldn't go out anywhere like this. Walking is hard, but possible [Venturing downstairs to get a drink was harder than I thought it would be - I staggered there with a sort of drunken lethargy, almost fell against the wall a couple times].  

+3.00 - Have been watching Simpsons the whole time. Haven't felt like typing anything. 



Really amazing visuals still. Seems to come in very quick waves of effects - really intense to quite manageable. 



[I read another 2C-B-Fly trip report and the author described it as constantly going from a ++ to +++ experience. I don't think I ever dropped lower than a +++, but there were times when I was really losing touch with reality, and 5 minutes later, I could be sitting there quite easily watching and understanding a simpsons episode.]



-------



My log ended there - I think I just couldn't be bothered to write any more, plus typing was still damn near impossible at +3 hours. There were a few times when I was really panicking because I started to feel like I did on the bad 2C-I trip I had a while ago. There was nothing in my room to put me on my guard or make me feel like that - I brought it on myself by thinking about my ex-girlfriend. I jumped on the bed to try and calm myself down and realized my heart was really racing - I've never felt it beat so quickly. Not sure if that was down to me panicking, or the Fly\ldots  probably a combination. 



Overall, a very enjoyable experience, although at times a little overwhelming. I had planned for the trip to be an experiment with 2C-B-Fly so I could document the effects, although typing was so hard and the visuals were a little too intense to allow for much of that. 



I'd certainly try it again, although at a lower dose - probably 10mg. I'm not sure if I have a naturally low tolerance to phenethylamines or what, but they seem to effect me much more strongly than anyone I've ever tripped with. 



There was, however, one main negative side effects that I'd like to mention. I dosed at 7.30pm on Friday with what I thought was a pretty `standard' 2C-B-Fly dosage. It's now 2pm on Saturday and I haven't slept, plus I'm still unable to sleep. Pupils are still dilated, although not to the extent they were last night.



I was up until about 5am because I just didn't feel like sleeping. Mentally I was really drained (I still am) and was developing a mild headache, but my body wasn't in the mood for rest. Any sensation of movement or pressure on my skin (particularly arms) 

made my nerves tingle and instantly snapped me out of the process of falling asleep. 



I lay in bed all night (from 5am until 11am the next day) unable to sleep. When I closed my eyes, I could still see colorful fractals. 



I'd say in total the experience lasted a good 10 hours, with a plateau of about 3 and a half. The comedown was very gentle, with OEVs lingering until the 8 or 9 hour mark. 



I'd recommend having some sort of sedative close at hand, because the whole not being able to sleep thing is not cool. I wanted to reflect on the trip but I can't because I'm so tired. I finally got to sleep at 1am on Saturday night, woke up on the Sunday morning feeling refreshed and pretty much back to normal.



If I had to compare the Fly to another chemical, I'd say it's like a strong 2C-B trip (15mg of the Fly gave me visuals I'd have to take at least 30mg of 2C-B to achieve), although very colorful like 2C-T-7. 



The body load was very pleasant -- a sort of warming pressure around the side of my head and neck and a slight tingling in the stomach area. I'd compare it to a low(ish) dose of mushrooms but without the cramps and nausea.
