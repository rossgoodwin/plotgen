Last july I was going to get my tonsils out, an experience which I was fully prepared for until I got into the operating room.



I had used nitrous oxide before this event on my own recreationally and under the supervision of health professionals. As soon as they wheeled me in there I began to feel tense and nervous. The fact that I was strapped to a table and I couldn't see what was going on didn't help make me any more comfortable. They began to administer the nitrous oxide and because I didn't know what was going on things really started to bother me. I closed my eyes and everything began to get fuzzy like usual, it all looked like colorful tv-snow. Even though my body seemed to have no response, my mind seemed crystal clear. I could hear the doctors talking, their voices sounded metallic and far away. The doctor told me that people used to have parties with nitrous and I was thinking `people still do.' 



I began to get really upset because I felt so helpless. I started to cry and I thought I was sobbing and then I heard the resident say `look at her laugh! Have you ever seen anyone laugh so much?'\ldots  I didn't even realize I was laughing until she said that, I thought I was crying. I started to calm down again. My conscious mind felt really dead, but my unconscious mind seemed sharper than ever. My mind kept saying `how trippy this is and how I probably won't even remember it and how that will be so weird.' then the doctor put the IV needle in and that kinda hurt, but kind didn't. I felt like I could `see' the pain but the pain wasn't that bad. My mind said `it doesn't matter if it hurts, cause you won't remember it later.' I was just kind of floating along, slowly drifting into unconsciousness. 

Then the doctors started to say there was something wrong with my breathing. They were saying things like `what's wrong?' and `what's going on?' which are not comforting things to hear from health professionals. 



All the machines started beeping, and the head doctor said something like `she has Reactive Airway Disease, I think that might be it\ldots  Change this, change that.. Fix this' the machines started beeping even more. I started to really freak out. I realized that I actually couldn't breath very well. Then it was weird because I knew what the people were going to say before they said it\ldots  I was so scared and my mind kept telling me that I was gonna die. I got really freaked out and said out loud, `I'm scared!' and one of the ladies said, `you're gonna be ok.' my mind became convinced that I was dreaming and that if I didn't wake up RIGHT AWAY I was going to die. And it kept saying `you're dying!' `you're dying' `wake up or you'll die!!' Suddenly I just totally snapped and I sat up on the operating table as fast as I could, I didn't understand why, if it was a dream, the people didn't go away and I was still on the table. I started sobbing and realized it wasn't a dream and I really thought that I had been about to die. 



I grabbed onto whoever was standing there and hugged them as tight as a could while sobbing uncontrollably. Then everybody was telling me that I was ok, and that everything was ok, and they put the mask back on me and that's all I remembered until the surgery was over. Later I found out that I wouldn't lay back down until everyone had hugged me. 



I woke up in the recovery room still crying and happy to be getting morphine. I can honestly say that that was definitely one of the most traumatic experiences of my life. Thinking that you're going to die is not a pleasant feeling and it left me quite unnerved even after I woke back up.

I guess that proves that even under a doctor's supervision you can have a bad experience\ldots  I definitely think that the environment I was in did not help any. When inhaling nitrous on my own I don't feel tense beforehand and I don't feel trapped or helpless. So being strapped to a table doesn't help any. Nitrous can be quite dangerous if you're not getting enough oxygen at the same time, I would have been fucked in that situation if the doctors hadn't been there. So I guess they're both good and bad. 



But it gave me a nice little story to tell and they sent me home with some nice parting gifts: two stuffed animals and a bottle of vicodin (but that's another story!).
