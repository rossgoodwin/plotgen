During the time I was having a horrible benzodiazepine withdrawal (from Klonopin or clonazepam, to be exact) I was looking for any way to calm the tremors/shakes/insomnia without having to spend any money.  At the time, I was taking 40mg of Celexa twice a day, 50mg of Trazodone twice a day, and .5mg Klonopin twice a day.  Here's the beginning, where the benzodiazepine withdrawal started:



I went to see my psychiatrist one day for a check-up and to get my prescriptions refilled.  He decided to take me off of Klonopin cold-turkey (I had been taking the three medications for sixteen months), and three days after that I started noticing that `something' wasn't the same.  I couldn't eat, sleep, or do any regular daily activities.  I had several annoying and/or painful abdominal pains and cramps, my head felt like it was on fire, and at time it felt like I was being pricked with thousands of needles on certain parts of my body.  This is when I decided to try to do something about it, or at least to be able to eat and sleep.



After two weeks of going through the withdrawal, I had lost nine pounds and I was getting three to five hours of sleep per night.  I was still taking my Celexa and Trazodone regularly, but it wasn't helping.  I got some diphenhydramine and it didn't help.  I also got some melatonin.  It helped to an extent, but every day would be the same `hell' I'd go through every day of the withdrawal.  Something had to be done, or else I would have to go to the emergency room.



I had read somewhere online that Trazodone not only induces sleep and helps depression, but can also help tremors and shakes.  I was thinking this is just what I needed, just at a larger dose.  I woke up one morning and took 200mg of Trazodone.  I became very hungry, I ate a lot (but became a little nauseous), and then fell asleep for four hours.  I didn't notice the Trazodone actually helping the withdrawal symptoms from the Klonopin, but at least I was eating and sleeping again.  



That same night at around 10:00 CST, I took eight of my 50mg Trazodone pills.  A total of 400mg.  I didn't get hungry or tired, at first..  I was just real `zonked' out.  I started getting tired about two hours after ingesting the pills, so I went to bed.  When the lights are off in my room, it's very dark.  Pretty much pitch-black until my eyes adjust to the lighting situation.  This time, my eyes never adjusted.  And after about five minutes of looking around into the darkness, I started seeing things.  Not really `hallucinations', but things in my peripheral vision and especially `under my eyelids'.  



I saw shapes (mainly triangles), blobs of color, and lines that seemed to `come at me'.  I stayed awake for four hours dealing with this; it would not go away if I closed my eyes.  The only other drug I've experiences something like this on before is DXM, but it was a still a little different.  I eventually fell asleep (I can't remember how), and I woke up feeling really weird and that lasted pretty much all day.  That's when I realized it wasn't a good idea to abuse the Trazodone.



I eventually ended up at the emergency room anyway because I couldn't stand the benzodiazapine withdrawal anymore (about two weeks into it).  I was prescribed a LOT (not only larger sizes, but more than I needed for the next three months) of Klonopin and started taking them immediately.  I cut the 1mg pills in half so I'd still take my dosage, .5mg twice a day.  Since then, everything's been real good.  I even joined a different mental health service which is a lot more understanding and comfortable than my last one.  Anyway, that's another story.
