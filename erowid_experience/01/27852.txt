The night started out with the acquisition of several Panadeine Forte prescription pills, each containing 30mg of codeine and 500mg of paracetamol (acetaminophen); having taken four I went downstairs, downed all four with a glass of water and went into my bedroom with the lights off to wait for the effects. It should be mentioned a week ago I took a similar dose and had an incredible time; this was only my second time trying codeine, which I thought to be a fairly safe opiate to experiment with.



15 minutes into the trip (for the lack of a better word) I received that now familiar tingling of the extremities, and brief, very small, rushes of pleasure up and down my spine. I didn't have any nausea or the `opiate itch' which I read so much about; so I thought I was having a good time. About 40 minutes in I was still feeling the same effects, with a gentle warmth across the chest and a very slight numbness, but the trip had increased very little in intensity since it began, which I thought at the time might have had something to do with taking a similar dose only a week ago, although I didn't think tolerance could build up that quickly.



After an hour I was feeling little euphoria, and generally feeling annoyed that I wasn't getting out of this what I expected, for a while I contemplated taking a couple more but remembered that a faq online said that re-dosages were pointless. After waiting another half hour, I got up and remembered that I had a small joint my friend had rolled some time ago in my cupboard, so I went to fetch it. I grabbed some rolling papers and some tobacco, my swiss army knife and some paper, and cut open the previous joint (which was snapped in half) and cut up the greens a bit, rolled myself a roach, burnt it a bit, and mixed the remaining greens with some rolling tobacco and rolled it up. Feeling fairly satisfied with my coordination even under the influence of codeine (which was having little noticeable effect) I went outside to spark up the joint (or spliff.)



I started feeling stoned halfway through the joint; it was about 12:30 local time here and my backyard was alive with insects, which normally would have freaked me out but I felt calm and generally happy as I normally do when stoned. After finishing the joint, which lasted a lot longer than I expected, I walked inside to watch some tv, pleasantly buzzing; I found comedy channel to be extremely funny. I decided to go listen to some music. I put on some cypress hill and talked to some friends on the internet before deciding to switch to pink floyd, with visuals on - the visual I was using was `battery - lotus' in windows media player, if anyone is interested.



As soon as the visuals came on, I started staring at the centre of it, and found that after several minutes of sitting there, with my head to one side and jaw fully open, that I could hardly move. My head was buzzing literally as I stared at the visual, which seemed to grow and distinguish itself from everything else; the visual suddenly filled my entire vision, a colour shifting whirlpool. As it circled around and around I followed it in my peripheral vision, my head now buzzing very strongly; then a pressure started coming down on my head, as if it were crushing my forehead downwards. I felt as though I was slightly outside my body, just in front of my face, with this incredible pressure; I was afraid to even blink because I thought it would ruin the moment, but soon found that I could do anything without ruining it. I blinked and walked around, to the mirror, noticing my eyes were fairly red. The same thing started happening to my pupil; if I stared at it for several seconds, it appeared to grow, and I would lean towards it (or it would seem to grow out at me, as if the mirror was shoving itself in my face) and the eye would rotate slowly, and my face became a sort of faceless mush, its hard to describe; it would slowly blur and then all I could see was my eye.



Enjoying this strange sensation I went back to look at the visuals again. Now the music started dictating certain things; the intensity of my headbuzz, and also my muscle twitching. My legs had started to twitch in time with pink floyd. I tried moving my jaw, and every time I did it was as if I could feel each individual muscle fibre, this incredible synergy I felt with my body; if I moved a muscle for a second my entire brain was focused just on that one point, I could feel the sinews twisting and my skin shifting and contorting when I made a smile or a frown or even flared my nostrils; moving each individual face muscle was very enjoyable, and almost an out of body experience. I tried moving the muscles on my back, and soon it felt that my chair was made up of individual sliding blocks that molded themselves to my back. For about ten minutes or so I was making faces and moving my back around, it felt so good.



Then I tried to talk. When I did, I was talking in an Irish accent, for no apparent reason other than I had subconsciously decided to; I still have no idea why I was talking like that, but soon I realized that when I spoke it was as if someone was talking to me; and I suddenly became a giant stone statue, moving slowly from side to side trying to find this voice that was almost taunting me; but all I could do was move my temple, or at least my jaw, which I could feel creaking just above my ear. At this point I started cleaning up my rolling tobacco etc. and found that I could walk, but walking straight wasn't always easy. I wasn't bumping into things and I knew what I was doing but I was definitely impaired.



When I came back to stare at the visuals once more I found it was now about 1:30, which was about 2 and half hours or so after ingesting the codeine, and about an hour having smoked the spliff; I could definitely feel I was coming down, as that incredible head buzz and the pressure weren't as strong, they were slowly waning; I was still staring at the visuals but now I could move my muscles and they would no longer intensify that feeling; just feel strange, as if to move anything I had to twitch. I realized then that I was shivering; putting two fingers to my neck I also had a fairly fast heart beet, which I couldn't measure in my state but guessed that it might have been somewhere between 100-120 beats per minute, because it was going about 1.5 to 2 times per second. I was fairly worried about this, because I only had a singlet and some shorts on; putting a hand to my head I also felt hot. I decided that I wasn't quite comfortable any more and went to bed. I then realized I had hit my forehead on something, which was now throbbing, and every time it throbbed it reverberated throughout my entire body, although it wasn't very painful. 



I finally went to bed and drank some water (as my mouth was still quite dry) and my heartbeat started going down again. Even staring at my ceiling in the darkness would have similar effects as before; it would begin swirling and would grow, but eventually I decided I didn't want any more of that and went to sleep.



I drifted off into a deep, 12 hour sleep punctuated by small breaks where I woke up, drank some water to battle the cottonmouth and went back to bed. Having just woken up I'm still feeling very heavy as I walk, and I've got a fairly large bruise on my forehead from something, but I don't know how it happened. Overall, an interesting experience with one of the most incredible absolute mindfucks ever, but something I might not be too anxious to try again
