A BRIEF BACKGROUND:)



Well to start I am 20 years old. At the age of 13 I experimented with marijuana and became a pot head. By the time I was 14 I did ecstasy about a dozen times and 1.7 grams of mushrooms. (Over a spread out time of course)  When I was 15 I was sent to a rehab for a year. After completion I stayed clean till I was about 18. I began drinking after 3 years of completely being clean of drugs and alcohol. I never became addicted to alcohol like I did marijuana. Anyway I wanted to do mushrooms once again, finally at the age of twenty I got my hands on them and decided to take them with a friend. 



MY PRESENT LIFE ON THE NIGHT OF MUSHROOMS:



A couple months ago (from the night I took mushrooms) I broke up with my girlfriend because of my personal reasons. I stopped hanging out with most of my friends because of my differences with them. I was upset by this. I tried to talk to my  

x-girlfriend in person. My girlfriend said she would meet me in person to talk. We spoke and it didnât go well for me. I drove home from her house SLIGHTY upset. Not to mention that I was reunited with my old friends and I was having a tough time with all this.



(THIS WAS THE SAME DAY THAT I TOOK MUSHROOMS, THOUGH I DIDNâT KNOW I WAS GONNA BE TRIPPING THAT NIGHT BECAUSE I GOT THE SHROOMZ LAST MINUTE//sry for caps)



THE GOOD STUFF:) ///the trip on January 3rd 2007



Now the reason you heard my sappy personal life is to see HOW THE PRESENT SITUATIONS IN YOUR LIFE CAN AFFECT YOUR MUSHROOM TRIP. About 5 days before I took the mushrooms I called my friend up and told him to find me some shrooms. He was unsuccessfulâ¦.until he calls me up on the night of 1/3/07 and says he has some caps and stems for me.  I buy a quarter ounce and split it with a friend who is a first-timer. I only knew I was gonna be eating mushrooms about an hour before I ate them. I didnât have a day to mentally prepare myself. The first time I did shrooms which was 5 years ago, I ate a half 1/8 and had a nice pleasant mild trip. Anywayâ¦ We decided to eat a whole 1/8 each. I had a sore throat and didnât eat anything but a PB and J at 3:00 pm that day.. I ate the shrooms straight at 9:00pm, on a very empty stomach. I was not gonna let a sore throat stop me from tripping. We walked out to the woods by my friendâs backyard and sat around a fire. My other friend who was straight edge was there to see the trip we were about to have. At 9:15  my legs were tingling up. My eyes were dilated and the porch lights began to look very bright and had trails. I honestly wondered if they were always that bright or if it was the shroomz. I was loving it. I had a huge smirk on my face and I couldnât  wipe it off. THEY HIT QUICKâ¦ 



Eventually my friends mom walked to our wooded area behind the house (a mother Ok with son and sonâs friends on shroomz, isnât she great!). She asked me âhow was your visit with your ex-girlfriendâ , suddenly my friend asked me âyou saw your ex-girlfriend todayâ He was very surprised because he knew of our troubles. I felt as if they were analyzing me and they all knew of the rejection I faced from my ex-girlfriend. âTHEY WERE ALL JUDGING ME I THOUGHTâ âTHIS IS ALL MY FAULTâ. I knew I was feeling it now. They went back in the house and I felt better. At 9:40 my friends and I proceeded to grab some soda and water from the house and grab some logs for the fire. By this point I really felt the shroomz. I felt great, I walked in the house grabbed some water and the lights in the house were extremely bright. Then at like 9:50 we all walked back outside and I was looking at the full moon. I thought it was beautiful, I was trying to walk around and look at the moon from a different angle. . 



After a couple of minutes of doing this I realized it was impossible. I then laughed at myself and realized how much fun I was having. (My friend who was tripping with me ate his at the same exact time but he seemed to have a nice mild trip) We eventually grabbed some logs and we got lost for about a minute in the small woods we were oh-so familiar with. I thought it was hilarious. By now Iâm feeling euphoria and everything looks so vibrant with all lights looking bright. 10:00 , now Iâm getting a little restless and the shroomz start really kicking in. I insist that we go back in the house. We did so and as I went in side, I looked at a hardwood floor and the grains in the wooden floor seemed to be rising up from it. I was like âholy shitâ. While looking in the mirror I saw a beauty mark on my face and it began to move around on my face. My face also looked very âlizard likeâ almost like it had scales. My friend noticed this too. I was laughing hysterically and panicking all with in minutes. My clean friend said that it looked like I was having fun, but was feeling something completely different on the inside. He was completely right. 



I kept pacing around the house like a lost puppy. 10:40, I am sitting in my friends living room with my two friends (one-tripping and one not) and his mother and sister. They had fun bugging us out by saying completely random things. They brought up the subject of  my ex-girlfriend. That made me uncomfortable and I almost called her up ready to completely breakdown to her on the phone. I stopped myself, we were listening to the song âlittle red riding hoodâ by the rolling stones. I found it very scary. 11:00. I am now bugging out of my mind at this point and everyone can see. Races of thoughts were running through my mind and I donât even remember what I was thinking. I remember that it seemed like 45 minutes where I was very panicked and I donât know what about. I know this was my peak because I remember feeling fucked up and then the next thing I know I came down A LOT. 12:30, my face again looks normal and the grains in the wooden floor were not coming up out of the floor. My other friend still maintained a nice mild mellow LONGER trip than mine. I guess he ate a normal amount of food that day. My guess is the mushrooms burned right up in my stomach and thatâs why my trip ended after 3.5 hours.



I laid down and just rested only to throw up at like 2:00 in the morning. The next day I just took it easy. Mushrooms are fun but really shouldnât be taken when something significant is going on in your life. Death of a family member, illness in the family, break up. You get the idea. Mushrooms arenât like most drugs that will numb your emotions. Mushrooms will make you stare your emotions right in the face. 

So enjoy
