My girlfriend and I had a great trip in the heart of Amsterdam last summer. We each consumed eight fresh mushrooms, Stropharia Cubensis, purchased at a `Smart Shop' in Amsterdam. We ate them as the sun set, at about 7PM. I absolutely *love* the taste of Magic Mushrooms, so we ate them as Nature intended them, raw. We washed them down with a few swigs of RC Cola.



We started feeling the effects at about 7:45. Our extremities were tingling, and everything took on a sharpness. Since we were in a hotel room without a radio, we started to wish we had music. `We want music, We want music' we began chanting. Little did we know, soon our request would be granted.



We had purchased some cannabis joints earlier, and I had read about the synergistic effect of cannabis \& `shrooms, so we shared a joint. That seemed to make the effects kick in much stronger. We started to trip pretty heavily by about 8:15.



It's hard to explain our trip. I only remember bits and pieces, and many parts of it are hard to put into English, or any language for that matter. I'll try to relate it as best as possible. To solve our music problem we started singing The Beatles' `Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'. When we got to `Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds', my girlfriend started freaking out. She later told me that the chorus made her afraid she would go crazy \& jump out the window. She started telling me that she didn't feel well. She thought she might need to go to the hospital.



Now I've tripped many times, and recognized this as mere panic. I tried to explain to her that these feelings would pass, but it didn't work. She went into the bathroom and tried vomiting. She kept saying `I'm dying, I'm dying' over and over. I was tripping pretty hard on the bed and didn't feel like moving. I told her that she'd be alright. I asked her to come over to the bed to lie with me. She kept telling me she was dying. She then told me that she was going to get help. She ran out of our hotel room. I laid on the bed, digesting what had just happened. It didn't take long for me to realize that my girlfriend had just run out of our hotel room in a foreign city tripping balls dressed in nothing but her *bra \& panties*!!! Not a good situation! I jumped up, threw on some pants, and opened our hotel room door, ready to track down my tripping girlfriend in the narrow streets of Amsterdam.



As soon as I opened the door, I almost stumbled on my girlfriend laying on the floor of the hotel hallway, seemingly unconscious. I dragged her back in the hotel room. She opened her eyes and had the most peaceful look on her face. `You saved me! I love you so much!'. I asked her what happened. She told me that she opened the door \& that's all she remembered. She kept telling me how much she loved me. We got back into bed \& and she had a great trip the rest of the night.



We had some pretty intense hallucinations. And the weird part is that we both hallucinated the same things. At one point, I remember seeing a vibrant Mayan city, in what must have been the high point of their civilization. The Mayan Temple looked new and radient and it looked like the Mayans were all engaged in some sort of religious ritual. I felt as if the `spirit' of the mushroom was trying to tell me something. `What do you know about the Mayans?' I felt it ask me. `Ah\ldots .', I struggled to remember. It was something I had recently learned, and it was important. `Oh yeah\ldots .the Mayans used psychedelic Mushrooms!!!' I felt this good feeling wash over me. My girlfriend looked at me warmly, and said, `You! Those are *your* people!' she said referring to the Mayans. A magical feeling filled me as I remembered that my mother was born in Guatemala, and I probably descend from the ancient Mayans who once ruled that land. This was probably the peak of my trip.



But it didn't end there. There was a point in our trip where I definitely feel that we were `contacted' by another intelligence. I can't describe this period, I barely remember it. But I recall *something* was talking to us. At first the voice was only in our heads, but I remember something weird: it was telling us something, and midway through its speech it stopped, and then started talking again, but the voice came out of my girlfriend's mouth. I mean, it was her voice, but what she was saying was a continuation of that `entity''s speech. And then she stopped, and *I* continued the instructions! It was very strange to say the least! It felt like some kind of wisdom was being relayed to us. Unfortunately, I don't recall what was said; and my girlfriend doesn't remember *any* of this at all! I believe that when strange things like this happen, it somehow erases your conscious memory of it afterwards. Don't ask me how or why.



Also, another freaky part of our trip: I got horny and wanted to have sex. We started to mess around, but then we got this weird `religious' feeling. I got all these images of crosses, and priests, and nuns and churches! I was not raised in any religious way whatsoever, and neither was my girlfriend. But we both felt it. It was telling us that what we were about to do was sacred, and we should be committed to each other in front of God. That freaked us out, needless to say. My girlfriend had some of my pre-cum on her hands. She said that she could feel the `life' in it. She then said it was Holy. Holy Water! AH! So that's what is meant by `Holy Water', we realized, and then we broke up into fits of hysterical laughter. That became a major `in joke' between us from that point on. `Holy Water', indeed!



As our trip began to die down, we laid in bed with our arms wrapped around each other. And we both realized that we felt like a tree. Hard to explain, not only our bodies, but our entire *souls* were wrapped around each other. And the roots of the `tree' we made was our past. And like a tree, we needed light and water to grow. But, for us, light=love and water=our friends and family. That realization made me understand that I wasn't growing correctly, because I wasn't properly `nourishing' my roots. I had been neglecting my friends a lot lately. That trip made me resolve to `water' myself more often!



Our trip died down about 5 hours after we first ate the 'shrooms. We smoked another joint, mellowed out and fell asleep. The next day we woke up totally refreshed and revitalized. I felt like I had an enema for my soul! It was one of the best trips I had ever had. I really recommend taking mushrooms with a loved one!
