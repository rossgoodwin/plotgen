 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:CORICIDIN\#\#  





So I finally decided to try and add my experience. I have tried the following: marajuana, which I only use to enhance my experiences now, alcohol, nicotine, percocets, various oxys, xanax, other pills. Well, I don't like to think of myself as a `druggie' but I have tried a lot of pills. Unfortunately `skittles' was one of the many. My friend James told me that he was doign these pills often. He said that he tripped on them all the time and they were great, so I thought hey, I'll try them. Well I got some from him a few days later in school (I'm a senior in high school). I decided that since I had never tried them before I would wait until I had some time where my mom wasn't home and I could try them without her bothering me. 



Monday: MLK day. We had the day off from school adn my mom was at work; the perfect time to try my skittles. Well James had given me 8 of them and he was about 5'2 and probably 115-120 lbs, while I am approx 5'3 and 110-115 lbs, so I figured we could handle about the same dosage. Now I am always very careful with drugs that I take for the first time. I had read about Coridicin and the like and figured I could handle it. I got up about 11AM and about noon I decided to take 4 of them.  Five minutes later I said to hell with that and took two more, making my total six. I waited for the effects to take place.



Abotu 45 mintues later I started to feel a little lightheaded and dizzy.  I stood up from my desk and immediately felt unfathomably dizzy and almost fell over. I went to the bathroom, about five feet from my room and looked in the mirror; my pupils were huge. I went back to my room and my boyfriend IMed me. I told him I felt sick and couldn't talk, he did not know I was taking drugs at that time. I stumbled to my bed and layed down and turned on the tv. My vision began to blur a little. It felt more like I was really really drunk than anything.



After about an hour I began to feel nauseated and sick. I made my way back to the bathroom and sat on the floor next to the toilet, hoping to throw up the pills. No such luck; there was nothing in my stomach to throw up. I went back to my bed after about 5-10 minutes and lay there attempting to watch tv. Soon my vision became doubled, then it was so bad that I could see better when I took my glasses off. I went back to my computer where I talked to James. He said he wanted to call me becsue I said I felt very very dizzy. I refused to let him do so. Then I proceeded to try and eat some food to try and dilute the medication becasue I had not eaten anything that day yet. I took one bite of a pretzel and spit it out. It flew across the room. I couldnt swallow it.



By this time I was having trouble breathing, my throat felt tight and I was breathing heavily from what I can remember. I went back over to my bed and lay there hallucinating. Everytime I closed my eyes I had vivid hallucinations. Its difficult to explain what I saw becasue I cannot really remember. If you have ever seen that picture of God's hand and another persons hand about to touch that is what I saw at one point. I think I saw God, but as I said, its hazy at this point. I remember hearing things. I swear that I hear someone running up and down the steps outside my room. I kept telling myself `Its not real, you are imagining it, calm down' but it didnt help. I slammed my eyes shut and tried not to think: impossble. I continued to hallucinate. Then I heard my door creak open a little bit. Suddenly, my cat jumped at my door and burst into my room. My heart raced, I think I almost had a heart attack. It was the worst feeling ever.



I just wanted it to go away. I wanted to Throw up, and sober up. But that was not possible. I tried to get some sleep. By the time my mom got home, which was abotu 6-7:00 I was feeling considerably better. My mind had cleared, I was no longer hallucinating but I had a bad hangover. I felt a little nauseated and sick. I had a headache. My mom didn't notice anything out of the ordinary thankfully becasue I am pretty good at hiding these things. I told her I needed to go back to my fathers hosue and do some homework so she took me to his house. By the time I got there I was feeling even better, but very tired. All I wanted to do was sleep. I changed into my pajamas and jumped into bed. Unfortunately I had school the next day. The hangover was similar to that of the ones you get after drinking a lot: headche, fatigue, nausea, etc.



Not to be preachy, but seeing as you are reading this I assume you are trying to find references to diffrent people's reactions to CCC. Thats a very goo dthing to do, BUT I also did that, and STILL tried these pills. In fact, I was reading about everyones bad trips after I had taken the pills, which ufortunately made it too late for me to change my mind, although I most likely would not have changed my mind anyway. There was very little, if anything, that was positive about my trip. I learned the hard way, and I hope that you don't learn in the same way I did.
