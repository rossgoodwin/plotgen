This report is to give people looking for information on Adderall as a recreational drug something to read. I'm a 16 year old teenager, and I'm at that point in my life where I feel a desire to alter my consciousness, not to relieve my problems, but to expand my horizons. My illicit drug history as of now includes marijuana, DXM, mushrooms, hydrocodone, oxycodone, hydromorphone, diazepam (Valium), and, of course, Adderall. 



Adderall is my weak spot when it comes to drugs. I don't do any drug, save alcohol, as often as Adderall, and it is by far my favorite high. Since I am in high school, it is readily available to me for extremely cheap, if not free, from one of the many many people diagnosed with ADD or ADHD. I first tried it when I was 15, looking for a new way to get high after being put on random urinalysis tests. Since then, I have done Adderall countless times, including today. I'm not a daily user, but still every week or so I'll take a dose of 3 pills (30mg). 



Now for the effects. About 20 minutes after I eat the pills, I get an uneasy feeling in my stomach. It's not a bad feeling, but rather good like an adrenaline rush. Soon, the feeling spreads to throughout my torso, and I get euphoric. I'm usually around people, or in school, and I get extremely talkative. If in class, I concentrate on my work much more than regular, and EVERYTHING is infinitely interesting. If I'm outside, drinking coffee with friends (as I usually am), I can't stop smoking cigarettes. Any subject I talk or write about I become very passionate about. If discussing politics, I will argue with emotion my opinion.



As the effects wear on, about 45 minutes after taking the pills, I become very friendly and all social inhibitions are lowered. I'm usually a shy person, but on Adderall I can and will talk to any girl I want, flirt even. But by far the best part is the body high. Much like a full body sneeze (same feeling as an orgasm, just to a lesser degree!), but just long lasting. Creative thoughts are stimulated, and sitting and just writing or drawing is incredibly fulfilling, even for a person who is neither artistic, nor a good writer like me. Also, my memory is sharper, and I can do crossword puzzles with ease (as I learned today). These effects continue for several hours, and after the peak effects wear off, I'm left with a wonderful, warm body buzz. Tranquility is the word for the latter hours of an Adderall high. All in all, the whole thing lasts a whopping 7 to 9 hours.



While peaking on Adderall, the only thing I don't like is the fact I have to come down at some point. I feel like Jesus when I'm at the apex of the high, and I never want to change that feeling. I have never experienced such euphoria off any other drug as I have off the blue pills, and I love the person I am when I'm on an Addy peak. There is where my problem lies. Because I have a seemingly neverending supply of these miraculous blue pills, I can easily see myself becoming very addicted. Already I have a huge caffeine addiction, so I see myself as very vulnerable to stimulant addiction as it is. As I write this, I have 6 pills looking me in the face, and I'm sure that come morning time I will take three with my morning coffee. My main source has been instructed to cut me off if it gets bad, but I have at least 5 other people who would supply me if I got desperate. Luckily I'm not to that point, and have never had withdrawl or cravings for my favorite drug. 



For anyone considering taking Adderall, I recommend it. As long as you don't get carried away, it is an amazing drug. It can be used to your benefit in several ways, but it also just plain makes you feel really good. And what's wrong with that?
