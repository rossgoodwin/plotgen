Here is a report on the experience of eight people.



12-14 mgs of 5-MeO-DiPT (Foxy) were put into gelcaps.  These were given to people ranging in age from 26 to 45 and 140-190\#.  It was suggested the people take 1/2 of the powder to begin with and after 90 minutes to 120 minutes supplement if they thought they might like to have a heavier trip.



Subjects are as follows:



A - 36, 170\#

B - 45, 145\#

C - 34, 170\#

D - 39, 190\#

E - 43, 140\#

F - 40, 165\#

G - 26, 150\#

H - 43, 145\#



Subject A is writing this and the responses below are gathered from observations during the trips and conversations afterwards.  Clearly the views of Subjects B-H will be different.



Around 11:00 people took either the entire amount or half depending on how adventerous they felt.  

This was taken just before or at a dance club.  

Most people had not eaten for 8-12 hours prior to taking foxy.



Common observations:



T +0:00, Taste is amazingly bad, it staying in your mouth a very long time.



T +0:15 - +0:30, Slight nausea, ignoring it seemed the best policy.



T +0:45 - +1:15, Stoning effect, visuals - mostly of intense colors, being touched is a sensual feeling, music seems flat and distant.



T +1:00 - 1:30, people that had taken half supplement.



T +2:00 - 2:30, Very strong visuals, colors highly enhanced, subtle patterns are vivd, flashing lights are captivating, being touched is extremely distracting, difficult to focus for long periods of time.  Drinks with sugar were a good thing.



T +3:00 - 4:00, Peak has gone, however it tends to return for short periods.  Again, sugar containing drinks such as Gatorade or Red Bull seemed to stabalize the roller coaster ride.



T +4:00 - 8:00, Slow comedown, very easy, still hard to focus for long periods.



T +8:00 - 12:00, Most people supplement with GHB or Execdrine PM.



T +24:00 - 48:00, Nearly back to baseline, however residual effects of delayed decission making common.



So that's what the common experiences were.  Each individual had different experiences.  The trips will be described for each.  The time lines will follow the general experiences and in general won't be called out.



Subject A:  Good trip, except for occasional worry about people not having a good trip.  Noticed complete lack of ego support.  If you have issues, a public place is a bad place for this.  Loved the visuals, much stronger than 2CT7 at 25-40 mg.  T +1:00 supplmenet with second half.  Amazing body feel, much better than E.  Rain felt like tiny orgasams.  Occasionally stationary objects appeared to be moving. Possible to drive at T +4:00.  At T +5:00 at an after hours party, the music was much better, full of energy and had to dance, however not nearly as hard as with E.  Absolutely amazing body feel.  Orgasams were far more intense than ever experienced.  Will defintely do this again, however probably not more than two or three times a year.  Probably best on a Friday with just one other person.  Probablby keep dosage to less than 10mg.  Used Excedrine PM to sleep.



Subect B:  Good trip, except for worring about people not having a good trip.  T + 1:00 supplemented with second half.  Fantastic visuals, great body feel.  Music was flat and distant.  Sex was great.  Probably won't do again unless with one other person.  Would probably stick with 5-8mg.



Subject C:  Bad trip.  Danced for a while, but just couldn't find the groove.  T +1:30 supplemented with second half.  Sat on a couch with friends and needed to be held.  Finally at T +3:00 took 1/2 tablet E.  This mellowed the mood and made it possible to remain in the club.  However dancing was impossible.  Just sat and enjoyed the closeness of people, being touched, the lights and the colors.  Some halucinations of stationary objects moving just out of the field of vision.  Absolutely remarkable sensual experience, not for a club however.  T +6:00 took a bump of K, extremely nice, sex was amazing, after sex, ended up in K-hole.  T +10:00 finally able to sleep.  Probably won't try again unless with one other person at a low dosage.  Used Excedrine PM to sleep.



Subject D:  Good trip.  Took entire dose.  Danced well, loved the visuals and body feel.  Was very pleased that foxy didn't interfer with sexual arrousal.  Worried about people that weren't have a good trip.  T +4:00 was possible to drive.  T +5:00 supplemented with second 14mg dose of foxy.  Incredible sex.  T +5:00 supplemented with GHB, MA (Tina), MDMA, K (trail mix).  Will repeat, probably not in public.



Subject E:  BAD trip.  Took entire dose.  Couldn't find groove, dancing difficult.  The visuals were too intense.  Could feel all the tension in body.  Coudln't speak to friends, couldn't find the right words to say.  Sat on couch and watched the world go by.  T +5:00, at after hours party felt much better, supplemented with Trail Mix.  Great body feel, sex was fantastic.  Won't do it again.



Subject F:  Bad trip.  Took entire dose.  Couldn't find groove, dancing was impossible - never happened before.  Definite anestheic quality on left side, tightness in one arm.  T + 3:00 supplemented with a bump of Tina.  Strange body feel.  Rain felt amazing.  T +5:00 felt better at afterhours party, supplemented with Trail Mix.  Finally back to normal at T +7:00.  Won't do it again.



Subject G:  Neutral trip.  Took entire dose.  Very slow couldn't find groove, difficult to dance.  T +2:00, supplemented with two bumps of Tina.  Could dance now.  T +5:00, supplemented with Trail Mix.  Excellent body feel, nice come down, great orgasams.  Back to normal at T +6:00.  Won't do it again in all likelihood.



Subject H:  BAD trip.  Took entire dose.  Good find groove - almost impossible to comprehend this, dancer by training.  T +2:00, supplemented with 1/2 E.  Still extremely agitated and nervous.  T +4:00, still can't dance, having a very bad time.  T +7:00, took sleeping pills, couldn't sleep for more that three hours.  T +18:00 still feeling the effects, still having a bad trip.



Conclusions:  If you LOVE to trip, you'll like this, if you don't you should not take it.  Best taken at home, not in a public place.  Leave your issues at the door, they will find you here if you don't.  NOT a good drug to dance too.  Great body feel and visuals.  Do it with someone you want to have sex with.



Prediction:  Won't ever be a popular club drug.
