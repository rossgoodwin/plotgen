First of all I would like to point out that the experimentation with these chemical compounds were done knowing all the risks it involved, including what happened later. It's also going to be a very long read since the experimentation took place over a seven day period total with a seven days resting period in between the first experience and the second.



Earlier experiences involve: MDMA, 2-CB, Psilocybe Cubensis, LSD, Marijuana, Mescaline, 4-ho-met, DMT, DPT, 4-ho-dpt, a long list of opiates and benzodiazepines, Amphetamine, MDA, MDAI, MXE, Ketamine, Different syntethic cannabinoids, Pregabalin, GHB, GBL and alcohol. 



The preparations were made over a period of two weeks, a large amount of 6-APB had arrived at my source and we were to sample this chemical more so than the last time any of us had tried it. The dosages are unknown after a period of time since this drug does affect judgement in a very dangerous way when coupled with a good mood and too much of the chemical in the body.



Day 1



T- 2:00 Had a decently sized dinner with vitamins as a supplement.



T+ 0:00 Everyone had arrived to my house on the countryside, there were now a total of 5 people that bombed 100mg each.



T+ 1:00 The first effects were felt and everybody got somewhat chattier and learned to know one another in a very deep and fascinating way. Some tingling sensations were felt all over the body.



T+ 2:00 Everybody was glowing with energy and the conversations really hit off and we got separated into smaller groups since we found it very hard to focus on what people on the other side of the room were talking about.



T+ 3:00 Now the effects were in full swing but no one of us was satisfied with the effects, so we bombed another 100mg each, we were still talking as if we'd taken amphetamine and one of the friends got a guitar out and started playing which really put us all into a state of trance and pure bliss.



T+ 4:00 Already now things start getting iffy with my memory, some confusion was present but I didn't really reflect over this matter, it was not a big deal since we were so enchanted by each other, the effects were now coming on like if I was under the influence of MDMA, in fact the feeling was so much similar that we started referring to the feeling as being ``E'd''.



T+ 6:00 Another round of bombs were shared, at this point my guess would be this time that we got between 50 - 150mg each, at this point we weren't really aware of the dosage given because of our state of wellbeing. A few joints were also rolled at this point and smoked in a strangely fast pace for all of us, the marijuana definitely gave the energized rush more energy. And it started becoming very trippy at this point, walls were moving around and colours seemed brighter, the curtains seemed to have a very funny spider web pattern bursting with energy waves.



This continued for about 6 hours more and nothing really notable happened during this time, other than men hugging each other on the floor with almost no clothes on, wet towels were shared and a lot of cigarettes, even those of us who did not smoke cigarettes usually smoked what I would call a large amount of nicotine.



T+ 12:00 At this point my judgement was gone and somehow I was talked into snorting a tiny line of MXE, this proved to be both a bad and a great idea. Instantly I turned into a robot, went into an M-hole while sitting on the toilet and was sat there for an hour while my friends were trying to get me to move so that other people could use the toilet, the tiny fragments I remember are so extremely hard to explain, it's about as unexplainable as a DMT trip is in itself.



I remained tripping through the rest of the day while most of the people headed home, one friend stayed and we dropped a bomb sometime in the middle of the day, I can't exactly remember when. At 22:00 I was knocked out cold and slept through the entire night like a baby.



When I woke up the next morning I didn't feel bad at all, neither did my friend, we smoked a couple of J's and had a pasta dish each and drank some energy drinks and tried to regain as much energy as possible since we knew that there was more coming the same night. We also hydrated with regular H20 and ate 2 multivitamin pills each, thinking this would help us recover a bit more.



Night came and here is where I lost track of pretty much everything, I know it was a great great night, and the following 3 days and nights too. However during this time I have no idea of how much 6-apb we took, nor do I know who came and who left, I remember we had visitors come from other cities to see how we felt and they were impressed at how ``fresh'' we were when they heard how long we had been going, I know I got a few hours of sleep in here and there but I was in no way sober during any of this time. I'd say that approximately a gram or a gram and a half was consumed per day with no bad things happening at all at this point.



The general feeling through it all was euphoria, however this subdued at I believe the end of the third night when it only went to being a very trippy, unrealistic world to live in, by day 4 I called quits and crashed hard on the couch after a joint and slept for about 6 hours. 



I was surprised to find two of my friends still going, however the energy was very very low and none of them seemed to enjoy it, all that was left of our happy party of friends was Jaw-clenching tired people who needed rest, we decided it was time to call quits. 



What ensued was a week of the worst ever come down I've felt, I was happy, I cried, I was happy, I cried. 5 days straight. I didn't feel any loss of appetite but this was reported by the other users. The anxiety was killing me so I decided I was going to take a few sobril during this week, to help mend my problems with the anxiety, this helped a lot as we all know it does.



Here comes the trainwreck part of the story.



Exactly 1 week after the last ``race'' I decided I should take some more, my body felt fit, my brain was in order and I decided I could probably take it. 



T+ 0:00 100mg was bombed



T+ 0:30, I decided I needed some social stimulation so I hit up a chat room with a bunch of cool people.



T+ 2:30 The effects kicked in, but knowing from the last week the effect of 100mg wasn't enough for me to feel in the right mood I bombed another 50mg.



T+ 3:00 at this time I'm in a much better mood than I was the time before, even though I was alone everything felt just right, I was chatty, everyone was friendly and I was totally engulfed by the computer and could do nothing else than chat. Wellness was felt through the entire body and I decided I needed no more for a few hours



T+ 7:00 I was still chatting away at the computer and the effects were starting to wear off somewhat so I bombed another 100mg and awaited the effects while chatting with people from all over the world about everything and nothing, I was in love, in love with the world, the people and all my friends I had met online and also tried communicating through the phone with little success, here things became trippy once more but in another way, I'm guessing this would be the first sign of what was to come, I got more twitchy, my jaws were really starting to hurt. And my eyes were feeling the pain of being overstimulated for too many hours. Brainwise I still felt okay!



T+ 14:00 I dropped another 50mg bomb and got a friend to come over, which as it turns out was what saved my life this night.



T+ 18:00 I dropped a 100mg bomb with my friend and we started chilling in my bed, getting to know each other better and talked about what had happened since the last time we met, this was his first time on any sort of stimulant, turns out he loved this stuff, but we decided to take it easy, the 6-APB hit him hard, he was in love, with everything. As expected of course.



T+ 23:00 The rolling had been going on for a very long time now and I was feeling somewhat tired and the effects were wearing off, so we decided we would drop another small bomb each, this time around 50mg, said and done we dropped it and within an hour I felt some very strong warning symptoms, my legs started twitching, the sweating increased from what I am normally used to with high dosages of amphetamine and other stimulants including 6-APB, within 10 minutes I was in such a bad shape that I had to be helped to the bed, another 10 or so minutes passed until I realized what could have happened to me, and had happened to me, serotonin toxicity set in and in a desperate attempt to get help I got my rolling friend to call 911.



He tried contacting a mutual friend of ours over skype, this did not work out too well since he was unable to communicate properly with a keyboard, he was actually incapable of communicating with regular speech as well. By the time he had managed to call 911 my body went into a state of shock. My heart was racing at 200 bpm, my blood pressure was up by 200/?(I will check these numbers once I get my hands on the medical report from the hospital) it took the ambulance roughly 40 minutes to get to my house and by the time they got here 3 patrol cars were already on the scene. 



For any law enforcement officers reading this, please do not try to communicate in a way that you normally would with a suspect, the way the police was talking to me, walking around in my house and observing me with flashlights made me fall into a state of pure fear. 



Never in my life have I been so scared, disoriented and confused as when the officers were pointing their flashlights in my face, around my room and reading my personal documents.

 

I'm not exactly sure how long it took the ambulance to get here after the patrol cars did, but it felt like an eternity, I couldn't control a single muscle, I was burning up and the pain in my chest and abdominal area was very intense. My entire body moved around in cramps that seemed like they would never stop, but they did, once the ambulance got to my home they gave me a couple of injections of diazepam and by the time I was in the ambulance I was out cold, and I stayed out cold for 6 hours only to wake up at the hospital with involuntary leg movements, pain in the muscles and a few more injections of diazepam were given to keep me asleep for another 6 or 7 hours.  Shortly thereafter I was released from the hospital after having a dinner and another 2 injections of diazepam and they had made sure we had a ride home.



The reason to why I can and do write this report as it is my first ever written is to warn people who are stupid enough like me and go over the border even though we all know what can and will happen if you do this. And also the last event lead to me being charged with several felonies, therefor I have no trouble posting this at all.



I will be taking 6-apb again, but no more than 100-200mg at a few months intervals, because this is something to be respected just as much as any other stimulant that affect the serotonin receptors in our brain.



I would also like to thank my friend who saved my life and didn't leave me during the entire hospital visit.
