The following is a detailed but insightful account of my experiments with Focalin, my relationship with cannabis, and what it all means to me. In case you don't know, Focalin is a stimulant prescribed for ADD. It is dexmethylphenidate, a chemical with the same effects as methylphenidate, the chemical in Ritalin, but it is twice as potent.



I was recently prescribed the drug for my ADD. My substance resume includes alcohol, tobacco, nitrous, morning glory, dxm, benadryl, nutmeg, kava, benzos, various ADD meds, and regular use of cannabis.



I will recount how my recent experiments with Focalin went down and summarize my overall conclusions.



9:30 PM: I get home from work tired as hell. I am drained and already half asleep. Unfortunately I have to write an art analysis for class at my county college, worth 25\% of my grade. It is late and my professor wants it emailed that night.



9:45 PM: Desperate, I swallow 2 10 mg pills. Remember this is DEX-Methylphenidate which is twice as potent as the non-dex version in regular Ritalin. I snack and chill, still exhausted.



10:15 PM: I start to feel much more alert like I had a cup of coffee. I feel euphoria coming on and my level of motivation goes from 0 to overdrive. I sit down at the computer and get started in 5 minutes. Usually it takes much longer if I start at all.



10:30 PM: My sole focus is the paper and I start hammering it out with full concentration. I feel euphoric but the euphoria takes the form of genuine passion towards my analysis. I'm no longer tired at all. My heart is pounding and I am super awake and alert. 



11:30 PM: I continue my analysis with highly unusual passion and motivation. I write detailed and beautiful sentences describing the painting I'm analyzing. It pours out of my mind and onto the screen as easily as my most treasured spontaneous poems. I ENJOY writing this once daunting paper! My mind is agile and able. My entire consciousness is engulfed in a fire passion toward creating an outstanding, deep and lively analysis.



12:30 AM: The contents of my paper continue to pour out and food or sleep is the last thing on my mind. A rush of euphoria rushes through my mind with each meaningful connection I make between the painting and its overall meaning. My analysis is filled with a surprising level of understanding, and sophisticated sentences pour out endlessly and with ease. My mind is working at full capacity but I don't feel strained.



1:30 AM: My heart rate and euphoria start to decline but the substance's effects are still quite strong as I edit the paper. I am just as motivated and inspired as I rearrange paragraphs and make minor changes.



2:15 AM: I read and reread my four single spaced pages and feel satisfied. I begin to feel burnt out but still alert. I go up to my room with a copy of the paper and take a break for a much deserved bowl of some dank herb.



2:30 AM: The weed sedates my overstimulated mind and refreshes me. Mildly stoned, the effects of the Focalin have mostly left me but the crash is medicated enough from the weed. My only negative symptoms are fatigue and brain drain. Refreshed from the bowl, I read my printed copy of the paper as I lay back on my bed. It is very long and complex, but it flows well and the quality is amazing. I realize as I finish reading it that this is one of my best pieces of writing and I am filled with a deep sense of satisfaction. I email the paper to my professor and feel relieved. I didn't just write a paper, I enthusiastically composed something interesting and unique.



3:00 AM: Finally in bed and still mellowed out from the weed I realize that I'd probably miss class if I slept. I decide to stay up so I can make it to my 8:30 class. With nothing else to occupy me till morning, I smoke another couple bowls



4:30 AM: Thoroughly stoned, the music from my radio lets my consciousness into its every stirring note. To kill my drowsiness for the night, I pop another half a 10 mg Focalin. Awake, but calm, I lay back and swim through the music, mellow and relaxed. I am quite high from the weed and I'm enjoying doing nothing after all that writing.



5:15 AM: I pop another 2 Focalin (20 mg) to kill my increasing drowsiness and stay up until morning. My stoned mind starts moving again and in 20 minutes my heart is pounding as I lay back and enjoy my music in an oblivious and comfortable daze.



7:00 AM: Awake and alert again from my last dose of Focalin, my alarm goes off but I'm already anxious to get my day started. I shower and get dressed with a euphoric exuberance.



7:30 AM: I have some cereal as I ramble on about various topics of interest to my mom. I am very talkative but my speech is not impaired by the pills as it would be if I was stoned. I've fully come down from the pot without any of the usual fatigue. I just have the need to verbalize my every thought. My mom doesn't seem to think anything of it thanks to my clear articulation. I then drive to class, awake and alert. I am sober and awake and therefore ok to drive. The only thing I'm on now is my maximum prescribed dose of Focalin.



8:30 AM: My ecology class starts. Unfortunately I'm now having my Focalin crash. My mind can't focus on the lecture and I battle nervousness and inevitable fatigue from my all-nighter.



12:00 PM: I go to work after a half hour power nap in the car. I'm tired but awake.



1:00 PM: I pop half a focalyn to get me through work and the rest of my day. The effects are unnoticeable but I'm not too drowsy to work and drive home.



4:20 PM: Now home, I can finally relax. The next day, I have no school and late work for which I am quite thankful! I toke up and keep on toking till the music carries me away to that sensual paradise of contemplative understanding and comfortable and euphoric satisfaction. You know, that state of mind where life makes sense and you can just lay back and enjoy the music and rest.



6:00 PM: 30 minutes late for dinner, sleep takes priority over food. With little desire to move, I bask in my stoned semi-awake oblivion and drift off into a deep sleep.



NEXT DAY



8:30 AM: After 14 hours of solid sleep, I somehow end up staring at my clock. Half asleep, I force myself up and have some cereal and espresso.



2:00 PM: Finally I feel awake and normal for the first time in 40 hours. I go to work and have a pretty normal day. My experiments, however, do not end here. In my summary I describe how it goes later on.



Summary: My long escapade all started with my amazing discovery of the beneficial power of Focalin. Interestingly, it ends with this experience report.  



Today is the day after my 14 hour sleep. At 9:30, earlier tonight, I got back from work and realized the dark side of the drug: the euphoria and speedy motivation is hard to resist!



Basically, I snorted a shitty alcohol extraction I prepared, then crushed 3 fresh pills and snorted them. It is the resulting high that lead to the this report. This very report is the result of my exuberant intake 2 nights after writing that art analysis. I'm coming down now, but I still feel the drug's powerful effects as I type.



I now understand how helpful this medication can be, but I also understand its risks. Looking at the past 2 days, I marvel at the way Focalin helped me write my art paper and this analysis, which I write with the same impassioned motivation that the substance gave me two nights ago.



This new medication has the potential to do anything from saving my academic career to destroying my body, mind and soul!



My excess use has left me with only one pill left, but I learned an important lesson. Weed is natural and mild. It can be enjoyed quite freely without a problem. Focalin, on the other hand, is a powerful drug that must be used properly in order to benefit and avoid addiction.



I see myself abusing it in the future, but only as a monthly pleasure. This way I will be making the most of its unique high without sacrificing the powerful potential it has, in moderation and as a medicine, to help me.



Cannabis too must be used with care, but once again, as it has done with each new substance I experience, the God-Given herb has proven to be the only psychoactive substance worthy of my full trust and respect. Focalin now holds a small place in my life, but it is cannabis, and cannabis alone, that I can rely on to brighten many a day of my life.  



After many adventures with many different substances, only cannabis maintains its place as the one I can always count on to alter my perspective so that I can see things in a different light. Cannabis, that sacred and ancient companion of Humankind, will always be there to light the dark and help me to see the way as I make my way through that ultimate journey that is life, and at the end of the day, what more could one truly ask for in a substance?
