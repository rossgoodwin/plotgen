I read once about Nutmeg containing a chemical similar to MDA and instantly, my curiousity was piqued.  I read that it was used in prison by those who could not obtain other highs.  The article I read expressed that there was a fairly high amount of toxicity in the raw material and that it could cause extreme nausea and discomfort.  So I put my basic chemistry and alchemical knowledge to use to perform a crude extraction that goes something like this. 



I took about 6-8 whole nutmegs and pulverized them in a rag until they were small enough not to chew my coffee grinder up, then ground them to a fine powder with the grinder.  This material was boiled in a shallow amount of water (about 2:1 water to nutmeg) After having boiled for fifteen or so minutes, I added somewhere between 1/4 and 1/3 a cup of vinegar, my theory being that I would cause the alkaloids to drop their salts, which apparently worked, as we shall see.  I then took all of the liquid and poured it through a coffee filter, being careful not to spill any of the solid material into the filter (which was attached to a jar with a rubber band around the rim).  This was a mistake.  As the liquid cooled and filtered, small particles of solids blocked the holes that the liquid was passing through.  However, a little light scraping of the filter with a butter knife seemed to temporarily relieve this issue.  After some time the liquid had all filtered through the filter completely.  



on the inside of the filter there was an off-white crystaline crust and floating on the surface of the liquid in the jar was a similar substance.  I took time and rescued the floaties from off of the surface of the liquid and rested them on a mirror.  I then blotted the edges of the floaties to aid them in drying out, which took a few days.  I also scraped the filter to free it of any of the crystalized stuff.  The floaties, once dried, were whiter than the scrapings from the filter, and were assumed to be more pure form.  Though, the darker color of the filter scape-stuff was probably due to some small particles of the powdered nutmeg getting into the filter when straining occurred.  I kept these two seperate none the less.



I had processed about 2.5oz's of nutmeg and had read that a dose was about one ounce.  So, I divided my resulting powder into two piles and called them each a dose.  Then came the testing grounds\ldots 



I stayed up one night and at about 11:00pm I snorted this stuff up into my nose (another mistake).  It was all that I could think of as a means of ingestion (I didn't think to re-dissolve it in water which is what I would recommed at this point)  after about a half an hour to an hour, alteration became apparent.  While the effects were mildly psychedelic, they were mostly uninteresting and seemed crude in comparison to other substances.  However, the powder did have a lethargic quality to it.  My mind was awake and I was thinking about myriad events and possibilities but my body was rendered limp.  I could not muster the energy to do anything.  I was also very dissapointed with the extremely nasty drips that accompanied my snorting of this powder.  I do however think that I entered a trance of some kind because I do not remember it ending, I just remember getting up the next morning\ldots with a pretty heavy hang-over.  Headache and mild nausea (the nausea was present somewhat the night before) were with me for the first half of the next day.  I decided that it was not worth trying again.



It was not very profound and it left more or less worse off then I had been before the experience.  There were about two to three hours of being altered before my memory failed, mild visual instability in surfaces, and that `argh\ldots I don't want to get up' feeling\ldots .not much else is worth nothing.
