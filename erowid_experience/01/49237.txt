A few nights ago one of my best friends told me about this new substance in town. We are both experienced trippers, and have quite a bit of experience with almost every traditional psychedelic drug. The name of the substance was 2C-I, but the person we were getting from was selling it as Molly. An Example of the fucked up underground drug market. Anyways we get the two pills with this cream colored powder in it. At about 8:30 PM we ingest the pills together at his house and wait it out. Both of us have read about it before, but we decided that night we would not refresh ourselves because we have done so before with other drugs, and completely ruined the trip due to the expectation of what other minds experienced.



The first effects I felt were about an hour later and it was a sense of tension, and a bit of a stomach cramp. With a bit of water though the cramps soon subside. About 10 minutes after the cramps subside. I start noticing that colors are very bright, and as we were watching T.V I recall that the colors of Family Guy have never been this bright before. I start getting the familiar sweaty palms and mucus in my throat. A similarity of coming up on LSD. I also at this point have a multicolored stress ball in my hand to help pass the time, and I remember looking at it, and it seemed as if the different marbled colors were translucent, and I could look through one color to see another. This was my first real hallucination along with the walls breathing. 



At this point about an hour and thirty minutes has passed, and we decide it is time for some pot. We walk outside to his back porch, and light up a joint. We smoke half of it deciding since that's all the pot we have we should save it for later. Now I am fairly high, and this intensifies hallucinations. We venture into his computer room, and we listen to a collection of Shpongle, Beastie Boys, and Chemical Brothers. At this point I am pumping hard, and for me it feels like eating three hits of LSD with the body sensation of eating a really good roll of Ecstasy. This is the point in which things get tricky.



My girlfriend calls me on my cell phone, and I try to talk to her. She knows what I have eaten, and is calling to check in on us. At this point I am not overwhelmed, but not in the state to talk on the phone. This is when I really get my ass kicked by the psychedelic effects. Everything starts speeding up, and I wonder why I was even talking to her in this state. In my head all I sounded like was a dumbass and that in combination with the feelings of empathy and love towards her I hand the phone to my friend and say that I cannot talk to her right now. He talks to her about 15 minutes, and right about when he hangs up with her I realize that I had just peaked, and I was starting to mellow out.



About two hours and fifteen minutes have passed since I ate this little pill, and we decide that since we have leveled out it is time to smoke the rest of that pot. We go outside, and this time walk down the road finishing the joint, and smoking a ciggy or two. Everything looks very similar to LSD in the sense that it is all crystal clear, and perfect. It was raining and cold yet I didn't want the world any other way. When we get back inside I notice that the feeling of Ecstasy has subsided, and all I am left with is a feeling very similar to the plateau of two hits of acid.



We decide its time to mix something else in with this so we grab a bottle of Jack Daniels, and take a few shots each. This makes the hallucinations much more real as I notice fragmenting patterns popping out, and melting back into the carpet. I have had these all along, but at this point they really distract me from reality. Now it has been about six hours since ingestion and I am still going, but not the intensity of before. My brain feels like a dried out sponge with a slight headache coming on, and I am ready to attempt sleep at this point. Needless to say we don't fall asleep till much later, about 4:00 AM, but it is a rough road to sleep however not near as rough as the road is after an LSD trip. I wake up the next morning feeling a little tired, but happy from the beautiful night I had before.



If I were to repeat the 2C-I experience I would take it by itself just to get the feeling of what it is really about. I think it is a wonderful drug, and I am defiantly going to trip on it the next time I can get some.
