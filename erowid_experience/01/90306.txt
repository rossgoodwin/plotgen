At the time of this trip I wasn't very experienced with psychedelics, I've done mushrooms and LSD each once a couple of years ago but since then I haven't touched any drug whatsoever. Recently I read online about PiHKAL and, as a chemist, I became very interested in the whole RC-scene and wanted to look into some of the compounds, especially the psychedelic Phenethylamines. 



So there I was with about a gram of 2C-D: My first trial was at 10mg to test allergy and/or if it was another chemical like 2C-P or 2C-E (which would have been devastating at these high doses). At 10mg for me, 2C-D was inactive.



I decided to take 60mg's while on vacation in the Alps in Austria. I figured the view; the beauty of the nature would be an amazing set for the trip. We were four guys, all between 19 and 21, none of them knew I was going to trip and I didn't want to say it until I really knew I was going to do it (they aren't really against drugs but they wouldn't welcome it either). So at the fourth day I said I would make a pause from skiing the next day to read and relax at the apartment; what I didn't know was that two of my friends (I'll just call them D and L) wanted to stay at home too. 



The next day at about 11:00 AM I stood up and told them what I was going to do, I weighed out 100mg of 2C-D dissolved it in water and drank two thirds. 



T+0:30: I am uncomfortable no matter if I sit on the couch and watch TV or stand up walking through the room. Another strange thing is that my teeth seem to hurt from the inside: It's like a very small but constant pain at the nerves. 



T+0:45: The body load increases and the first visual distortions are perceivable. I am sitting on the couch, watching an episode of Futurama and I notice that the colors are intense and look better than usually.



T+1:00: I decide to drink the last third of the solution I made since I don't want to throw it away. I have ingested now the full 100mg's. I continue sitting on the couch and at my left there's a blank white wall. Slowly an image starts to form on the wall: It's a big group of fans in a football stadium, judging by the colors and the flags (they were moving around in a circle, it was difficult to exactly make out which flag it is) they're Brazilian fans. I only thought to myself: Wow, this stuff is really fun.

Unfortunately I decided to tell my sober friends about this, from this moment on they made fun of me from time to time which is NOT in any way enjoyable while tripping. 



T+1:30-2:15: Effects are getting stronger every minute, the body load is the same but the strange pain in the teeth wore off a couple of minutes ago. Visuals are very present now, but besides the white wall, there are no vivid hallucinations. Everything I look at starts to morph, the colors red and  green appear everywhere, it's like the real color is in the middle and the upper edge is red and the lower edge is green. 

Since I am tripping quite hard now (2C-D is, for me anyways, a very emotional drug) I start calling a girl who knew that I was going to take the 2C-D and who was familiar with the effects and thus wouldn't make fun of me like D and L. I am constantly walking through the apartment, looking at stuff: everything I look at starts to move, to twist and to ``breathe''. The grain on the wooden doors and cabinets looks sharper and has more depth than usually. 



T+1:50: Here came the bad part of the trip: Cleaning ladies knocked and wanted to clean the room. I was in no condition to behave normally around them so I waited in the bedroom for them to clean the living room. You could hear them talk in a strange dialect and giggling all the time, this was barely tolerable since the auditory hallucinations on 2C-D are rather disturbing (I heard knocking, voices of people who were around when they weren't even talking etc.). 



Then they wanted to clean the bedroom where D, L and I were staying, too. All this time I was talking on the phone and I started to get really desperate at the time because of the strange laughter of the cleaning ladies. I escaped to the balcony and was now looking at the mountains and the clouds. Wow, this time it was really an astounding view: The cloud looked like a rastafari woman smoking a joint. The mountains swayed back and forth and the trees looked like little lights which were constantly turned off and on in some form of pattern but I never figured it out. 



One of the cleaning ladies even entered the balcony and began to clean the windowsill, for a second or so I thought it was a goblin. Thank god I could resist screaming but it was frightening nevertheless.



T+2:30: About this time I think I was at the peak, I was tripping very hard running from wall to wall looking at everything and laughing about things no one sober would find remotely funny. 50\% of the time approximately I was talking on the phone (with the girl I mentioned). 



T+3:30: Still peaking, the fourth friend comes home from skiing. Apparently the other two called him and told him how I freaked out about the cleaning ladies etc. He was the one who I knew would be against me taking the trip, not because he is against drugs but because it's a ski vacation and it's not fair for the others. 



He sat on the table and started cutting salami and cheese and eating and I was just sitting there looking at his arm muscles when he looked at me, something in that look didn't feel right and I said something like: ``Wow, T, your arm muscles frighten me.'' As soon as I said that I realized I just talked about fear and I thought about how that would effect my trip and a very strong cold feeling took my whole body. It wasn't necessarily unpleasant but very intense and I knew this was not good so I distracted myself looked the other way and tried to concentrate on the visuals. Thank god this worked; I never had a bad trip bad I can now imagine that a few hours with such a feeling wouldn't be enjoyable at all. 



Another peculiar thing happened, at the time I looked at his muscles: the body parts became numerical values; his upper arm 45, his lower arm 33; my mobile phone also 33. I can't really describe why but the things just felt like the numbers. I had the impression that I was in a computer program that really just is my brain and that in this consciousness I can analyze how my brain thinks about certain items. This was a very interesting thought but I couldn't force to analyze the things and find out their ``values'', I just looked at some items and it struck me. Also when I looked at my phone and saw that my phone had 70\% battery I was happy, and liked that number and it somehow made sense to me. This was by far the most interesting thing of this trip, the importance of numbers in my brain.



T+4:30: Effects are now slowly wearing off, I enjoy watching scrubs and looking at the morphing faces of the well-known actors. 



T+5:30: Still a strange body buzz going on, slight visual distortions. I want to be sober now this light effects aren't fun anymore. 



T+7.00-9:00: A very light body load. Nothing else.
