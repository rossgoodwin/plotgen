Ritalin is a stimulant, prescribed to those with ADD or ADHD which for some reason slows them down.  I decided to experiment with it as an upper, since I am not afflicted with either condition and like the stimulant affect.



My first dose, 2 10mg tablets, had almost no affect, but then I'm an old speed freak from way back used to 1/2 gram at a time. I hadn't done anything except ephedra and coffee/tea for 10 years.    



Next dose, I tried 4 (40mgs) and I got quite a buzz, just like a good clean strong cup of tea buzz at first, but after about 3 hours of working around the house and coming up with neat ideas for projects, I realized I was stimulated to quite some degree. It was noticeable to my husband.



I attend college, so I tried waking up and popping just 20 mgs. (don't want to get too talkative or blow it) and I felt nice and peppy driving to school, but the drive is 45 minutes and by the time I got to class I was alert but that could have just been me.



I've just started snorting it after reading a post of someone who did - I tried just 10mg. (one pill) at first.  It tasted way horrid (as stuff usually does going into your mucous membranes).  Nothing happened!  So I tried two, and the affect was nice, uppy but not too much.  There is a tolerance factor, though, and if I have had more than 50-60 mg. in one day, 10mg or 20 more won't do anything.



To date, taking into account tolerance factors, and stupidity to do this in the first place, my daily routine is as follows:



5 or 6 a.m. - pop 20mg (on workout days I perform my resistance training no better, but it is less painful and more fun)



10:00 p.m. on campus - one or sometimes 2 more 10mg to get me through to the end of classes at 2 p.m. - Not enough to make me seem high but I don't get the mid-afternoon crash affect even in boring classes.



3 p.m. - either during the drive home (again, it's 45 minutes) or just when I walk in the front door, I pop 30 mgs - then it's study time and I do mean study time - no problem focusing like with speed except one time, and that was when I took 40 mgs just to see what would happen. I started following every strand of my (now brilliant) thoughts until I had blown hours on worthless net surfing, with barely anything to show for my classwork.  



I did research on this drug, as I didn't want to die of a heart attack or have a stroke.  I'm 20 years older now than when I used to shoot speed, and my body is therefore probably 40 or more years older than that! What I found out about dosage is that doctors prescribe UP TO 80 mgs. per day, of course spaced during a 12-hour period, for adults. 



I also checked out OVERDOSE information, and if I get the pinpointed eyeballs and accelerated heart rate with sweating and muscle tics or seizures, well then obviously I've overdone it.  



To sum up:  For an occasional study session when you don't want the coffee grumpies, but need that extra concentration to pull a good paper or assignment, it's okay. Just be careful.
