It was around 8:00pm when my friend `Paul' called me to say that his connection had finally recopped - we had been waiting two days to buy some crystal meth and now the time had finally come. I was excited due more to the anticipation that had grown over the past two days than anything else, and ran to grab my car keys and drive as fast as I could to Paul's house. The plan was to buy a \$50 bag of meth, and then Paul and myself would head over to my other friend `Adam's' house just a few blocks away to smoke. The problem was, our dealer only had a \$30 bag for sale and promised to deliver the other dub to Adam's house once he went back to recop. I agreed, and Paul was handed a dime bag full of some of the freshest crystals we both had ever seen - definitely worth the wait. 



Instead of usual powder and some small shards, the bag contained completely shards, and pretty big ones at that. I smiled and raced to Adam's house to start this session off with a bang. Paul and I arrived at Adam's and the three of us all went into Adam's room where we seperated the \$30 into three huge bowls. Paul then proceeded to pack one of the bowls, melted it, and let the good times roll. The first thing I noticed was how much quality this meth was - just one good hit of this smoke to the neck had me spinning; in all eight times before this that I had smoked the crystal had usually taken a few tokes to take full effect. While I won't go into specific details about the lone meth high - you can easily find many other experience stories on solely meth - I will say that it was intense and I was wide awake and feeling fantastic. 



After the first bowl, we waited and packed a second one, and then for about an hour or so my friends and I all chilled - they messed around on their guitar and bass instruments while I decided to write some ideas down and tag on this clipboard I had found. I waited for what seemed like an eternity for that dub sack of meth to arrive, and yet it never came. My friends and I smoked the remaining bowl of crystal that we had and waited until around 1:00am before Paul and myself finally started to head back to his house; giving up on buying that extra \$20 of ice. I dropped off Paul and he tried one more time to get that dub, but when I realized I would have to wait a few more hours into the early morning for it I decided to just go home instead, I had other means of getting high that night as well. On the way home I stopped off at AM/PM and bought a Swisher and a Black \& Mild, then drove back to the house.



I got home around 1:30am to discover my parents both sound asleep. I went into my room and did a check of what substances I had left - about 5 grams of some chronic weed I had bought earlier in the week which easily matched anything available from the cannabis club (I'm a pothead so if anything I know my marijuana) as well as five pills of 10mg Ambien that I had pinched from my dad who was being treated for insomnia. I had never taken Ambien before, but from what I read online and from asking people the pill was supposed to be a strong sedative that made you `really stoned' and worked almost instantly. Curious, I decided I would try some that night.



I dropped a 10mg Ambien and then proceeded to roll a blunt (a gram or so) with the Swisher. After ten minutes or so, the blunt was rolled and I was still kinda spun from the session hours before but the Ambien hadn't kicked in. So I broke another pill in half and dropped 5mg more. After grabbing the blunt, the Black \& Mild, a lighter and a towel, I headed outside to my hot-tub to enjoy myself, and it is out in the hot-tub where things started to get weird. I got into the hot-tub and the soothing warm water instantly relaxed me; the Ambien also was beginning to kick in and I was calm and collective, care-free and actually, kind of tired. I lit the blunt and began to smoke the buds - continuing to do so as I sat back and relaxed. 



I don't know the exact time it occured, but shit really hit the fan when I was about half-way finished smoking the blunt. All I remember is closing my eyes for a second, and when I opened them I was no longer apart of reality as we know it. It was so intense that I put out the blunt for later and lit the Black \& Mild to calm down. At first I was shocked and scared - I had expected to just feel stoned and instead, I was having a more intense psychedelic high than ever I had when I ate shrooms a few times in the past. I was having strong hallucinations of solid images and figures such as human beings and cartoon-like characters, as well as any object I looked at began to warp and wiggle in front of my very eyes.



It was 2:00am and still dark outside, yet everything I looked at had a colored hue to it and my vision went from everything looking like a negative camera film roll to purple and light yellow colors, hues of light green and bright red. Also, the ground was sinking like sand, and globs of what looked like slime were dripping everywhere. I was also hearing things - strong auditory hallucinations of my parents talking about me, as well as just other sounds. Never on shrooms had I tripped like this - it was a fucking Simpsons episode in front of my very eyes. 



I was still able to control my high (well, kind of) and realized this was getting a little too intense - I thought I might start screaming and running around the backyard so I grabbed my towel and went inside the house to my bedroom. I was still hallucinating hard and got into my bed; where for a few hours I just watched my walls warp before my eyes, shadows would turn into characters and run around the ceiling, and objects such as my room lamp and television would turn into cartoon-like objects. I opened the blinds in my room's window so I could glance outside and trip at looking at the trees and such as well. It is at this point that I forget what happened, but I eventually fell asleep I guess and didn't wake up until around 11:00am - sleeping through my alarm and missing all my college classes for the day.



I will definitely be trying this mix of narcotics again in the near-future, it was too amazing not to. But I will not be taking any more than one 10mg Ambien - this shit is strong and could be easily underestimated. I am still deciding if I should tell my friends about my `discovery' - but then again I question myself everyday on what this shit would be like with other people there. If you try this mix then by all means enjoy yourself but remember, it's probably going to be different for different people and I have no idea who anyone else would act on this amazing, amazing psychedelic trip.
