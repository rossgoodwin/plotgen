Before I start, I'd just like to point out that I am not a regular user of Methylphenidate by any means, having only taken one Concerta pill (72mg) before this experience.



It was about 11:00am, right after eating a small breakfast, when I decided to take two pills (orally) out of three that a friend had given me, the reason being I had not had much sleep in the past week and had not slept at all the previous night. Anyways, it took almost an hour before I started to feel the effects starting to kick in. I to started getting a bit of a head rush, feeling warm, and a bit tingly all over my body. It was overall pretty pleasant.



It certainly helped me focus but didn't really help with my tendency to procrastinate. Over the next few hours the feelings got a bit more intense. Seeing as I had only one pill left, and wanting to push the experience as far as I could, I decided to take the last pill at around 3:00pm. I continued doing much of nothing until about another hour later when the effects hit me like a brick wall. It increased the feelings I had before dramatically. I had an incredible head high, feeling extremely warm. Usually I don't like being too warm but somehow it felt good. My whole body felt almost like I was being tickled, with this feeling increased ten-fold right below my ribs.



As the feelings got even a bit more intense, it just made me want to talk to people, even to the point that I was rambling on to people about things they obviously weren't interested in. The problem was, as soon as I stopped doing something, the tickling feeling got so intense, especially right below my ribs, that it felt like somebody tickling you but you can't push them off, it just felt so good that in a weird way it was unbearable. As soon I got my mind focused on something else though it subsided a bit. As the hours went by, the effects would slowly start to wear off and the head high would disappear, and then suddenly the head high would resurface and the whole experience would become more intense again, presumably because of the sustained-release mechanism in Concerta. It did this a few times in waves.



At about midnight I realized that I wasn't fatigued at all. This was especially strange for me because I even feel fatigued on normal days, let alone the horrible sleep routine I had been on. I also realized that even though I had not eaten since breakfast, I wasn't the least bit hungry. By about this time the first two pills should have worn off but it didn't feel much less intense than it had previously.



It carried me till about 5:30 where I started yawning and noted the effects were wearing off. Due to not having much sleep, not to mention the Concerta making my body work a lot harder without any real energy, I crashed hard about a half hour later. It was the most intense feeling of tiredness I have ever felt in my life. I'm surprised I managed to drag myself to bed. The only effect I still noticed was that of being warm. On normal nights I don't sleep with my heavy comforter, because I like being cool while I sleep, but even feeling extremely warm it just felt so much more comfortable to pull the comforter right up to my face. I immediately fell asleep.



Overall, I really liked the experience. It does wonders for focusing, fatigue, and as an appetite supressant, and I love the tingly feeling it gives. I wouldn't do this again any time soon simply for the reason that even when you find it uncomfortable, you know it's going to last all day. I may experiment with even higher doses of shorter-acting Methylphenidate to see how far I can push the experience. At least this way any discomfort I might run into ends relatively quick.
