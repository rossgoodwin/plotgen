Trip 1: 13 Pills



I took most of them around 6:50, and then had to clean my room. by 7:10 I was feeling it and had only taken 13 at this point, with all the intentions of finishing the two packs (but I ate them until I began to feel the effects). A lightness and dizziness overcame me first, I remember smiling at the fact. We were at Keith's house only moments later, and I assumed that I couldn't possibly be tripping yet (onset in only 10 minutes? unheard of). The first step I took outside the truck was plunged into the ground like I weighed at least twice what I do, and all of it was in my foot. `My feet are magneticking to the ground!' I discovered the slurriness of my speech. `Baby.. there's no way I can play this off in front of your parents.'



Keith guided me into his room. Breathing was weird, walking was extremely difficult, along with maintaining unaided balance. I fell into the bed like a boulder off a cliff. My body was numb and being washed over with what can only be described as elation. I remember trying to make a fist for some reason and discovered I could not clench my fingers into my hand. I suppose right then was where it hit me the hardest and everything afterwards is fuzzy, much like my vision was; everything I tried to look at close to my face not only became unintelligably blurry, but also caused my eyes to cross. Keith brought food, which excited me, but I found myself no longer hungry and completely turned off by the thought of food; thusly I ate nothing. Keith encouraged me to take the remaining 11 tabs, but I giggle-coughed that I was plenty fucked up for one evening.



My first visual came to me when I closed my eyes and looked in to the dark: I saw a neon sign, turned on its side, that said `Eat at Joe's' and had some random symbolism on it. It must have been 10:30 when we finally went back out to the truck to smoke, and I realized that my throat hurt; cottonmouth. I tried to open my mouth and felt every tastebud on my tongue peel off the roof of my mouth. The cottonmouth was comical at first;  Keith and I both made random sound effects with it, and then it was time to remedy it with water. 



Confounded cottonmouth was impervious to water! Smoking was actually unenjoyable, as lately I had noticed that our bowls were tasting quite bad when smoked out of but I continued to smoke, bad taste, cottonmouth and all. Two bowls in and two bowls did us, we sat in the truck for some time, laughing and talking about the random things that were happening. I wanted to tell Keith the story about my friend April, but instead of speaking I invisioned April in front of me on the day that I witnessed this and remembered what she had said, and the next thing I knew I was talking to her and she was responding like nothing was out of the ordinary.



My eyes opened, no April, and I could have sworn she was there, I could have told you exactly what she was wearing and how she was standing. Observing insignificant things, like what is going on in the background of the subject of the hallucination, is completely clear and easy to examine. She was only one of the many people that I conversed with throughout the night that were not there. Everytime I tried to think of something that involved other people I knew, my mind would spiral madly in their direction and I would begin unintelligable and random dialogue with them.



I was tired but beating it; no point in sleeping when I was in the middle of a proclaimed 10 hour trip. Heaviness and numbness was all over me, but my breath was short and my lungs were heaving slowly, and I remember checking my pulse: it was beating incredibly fast and rather than recognizing it as a sign of dehydration, I thought I was just imagining it and dismissed it. Keith left the truck to piss and closed the door as it was cold, leaving me alone in the truck. I heard my name being called in the distance and stared around for the source of the voice (a woman's, breathy). I told Keith to turn on the music, but I discovered he wasn't back yet and I could have sworn I felt him get in next to me. I remember staring down at my legs, but I realized my eyes were closed and yet I could see what I was wearing, which I in fact was not wearing. I have no clue what went on afterwards, but it was quite enjoyable. My conclusion the next day was that I couldn't wait to do it again.



Trip 1: 11 Pills



I took them at school before I smoked a cigarette, and by the time I had finished the cigarette I was feeling it in my brain. I sat back at the computer and went about my business as I waited for the eminent trip. My brain felt wet and my feet again magneticked to the floor. I remember having to draw deep breaths to capture the air. My eyes wandered and I found myself staring at my closed black \& white comp book when suddenly I noticed smoke pouring out of the top. I gaped at it for a moment and realized it wasn't smoke, I was SEEING the AIR. It was EVERYWHERE. My heart felt tension and my lungs complied by tightening, so I went to the bathroom to check on myself. As I passed my reflection in the mirror I noticed my skin was orange, and I'm talking fucking ORANGE. I stared into the mirror and wondered if anyone else had noticed (this may or may not have been a hallucination). Class ended and now I had to drive home; god was that difficult.



 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# 



I kept forgetting where I was and not recognizing anything or feeling like I wasn't driving, so I have to say driving on dram is a STUPID FUCKING IDEA. When I got back to Keith's it was only 10 something, which isn't so bad considering my class isn't supposed to end until 10. I saw the light coming from his open bedroom door (odd because its never open, whether he's in it or not) and smiled knowing he was awake. The light coming from the room was different though, and on my entry I discovered the reason for it being he had lit two candles near his bedside in a sad attempt at making his room a little warmer, it's freezing in there. He looked at me really weirdly and I querried him on what was wrong. `I'm so depressed. I've been like this all day' of course I was ready to cry due to my fuckedupness, and I had just read that abuse of dram causes mild to severe depressia, and Keith had already done 4 boxes in the last two days. I don't remember much after that.



Trip 3: 20 Pills



What else can I say besides this was horrible? There was no weed to smoke to calm me and no matter how much water I drank, I couldn't drink enough, nor could I keep drinking and threw up nothing but water twice. I burned all over and couldn't breathe or swallow of my own volition; all I could do was try to ignore it and wait for it to pass. But it didn't pass. In fact, it only became worse, and my cottonmouth was to the point where I couldn't even open it anymore. I felt like crying a few times but I couldn't.



Keith took his 24 again, but this time after several hours, he threw up. I wanted to go into the bathroom to take care of him, but I was unable to move my body more than a few inches at a time, and would get confused and upset when I forgot what I was doing or where I was. I remember opening my eyes several times and wondering frantically where I was, or thinking I was in my room or in the truck when I was actually inside. I prayed for sleep, which I knew would be difficult (it was last time) but somehow, it managed to creep up on me (Keith says the dram makes him really tired).



When I woke up in the morning I felt like complete shit (dram hangover) and there was still no spit being produced by the glands in my mouth. I tried brushing my teeth, drinking, eating and stimulating the area under my tongue but all was to no avail. My stomach hurt, my heard hurt, my body felt hot but I myself felt like I was cold. Keith thought I had a fever, which I did not. I went back to sleep when Keith left for work, still feeling shitty and worried since he'd now left me alone and no one was around to take care of me. At 4:10 I awoke again and I felt perfect, spit in my mouth and all.



Last Trip: 10 Pills



At school again and not being able to withstand the stress, and having no weed, I ask my brother to give me 10, thinking it wouldn't last that long, or at least, not TOOOO long. He laid out in the van while I went back to my class. I awaited the trip eagerly, it took much longer to set on for some reason and it sort of upset me. I took them with chocolate milk, but the combination ended up making me sick to my stomach and I hadn't eaten all day; it was 7:30 at night. Feeling frustrated at the prolonged wait I began to fidget and attempted to pay attention to my instructor. The lights were off, monitors were on and the bright dropscreen projector was eminating. I looked towards my professor who stood in front of the screen, and nearly fell down, save that I was sitting; the light was dizzyingly bright and my vision completely went to shit. The heaviness was absent, and so was the lightness, but the first thing that crept up was the cottonmouth. I immediately began chugging chocolate milk trying to keep from getting dehydrated. No good. I saw nothing but felt a little queasy.



At 9:50 it was time to leave and I had a little trouble with the stairs. I had HOPED that I would be able to drive by the end of class, but I wasn't, though I did anyway. Since I knew what to expect of the driving experience, I handled it far better and didn't get lost or upset, though I did swerve around inside the lines. I took him home and returned to my boyfriend, feeling absolutely miserable. I collapsed into him and was unable to stand for the rest of the night. My mind was blurring and white, and I couldn't think of anything but to tell him what was wrong. I had hoped that I would have a better trip than the last, but this cemented my newfound fear of the drug. The dehydration was overwhelming, and my body felt angrily restless and would twitch and convulse and flip me all over on the bed, and I had absolutely no control over it. I felt hot so I would remove blankets and clothing, and immediately I began to get cold and would ask my boyfriend to help me cover up again.



I tried to sleep but it was nearly impossible, the only thing going through my mind was `When will this be over?'.  He attempted to comfort me and hold me, but I am sad to say that sometimes I didn't even know he was there. This continued for me all night until I finally exhausted myself to sleep. I woke up in the morning absolutely starving and I felt as if I had a cloud over my head, but it was gone after I ate. Overall, it wasn't worth it.
