This is a report documenting my first two experiences smoking Anadenanthera peregrina. The first experiment five seeds were de-shelled, crushed to course sand size then smoked raw in a glass bong. The second time five seeds were de-shelled, crushed then mixed with 1/3 lime (powdered seashells). Water was added to make a thick paste and then allowed to dry out over a period of several days, then reground and smoked in a glass bong.



Experiment 1) My mindset is slightly anxious as I have never had a DMT like experience. I was with my dogs sitting in my living room looking into the backyard through the sliding glass doors. I took large hits using a torch lighter -- the raw seeds did not burn easily at first but by hit 5 they were putting out a lot of smoke. This worked out fine as it seemed the more hits and inebriated I became the longer I could hold in the bigger hits. 



By the 3rd hit I felt strange -- similar to mushroom strange. When I exhaled the 5th hit the smoke was blue and rotating in front of me in a very unique almost flower like way. I definitely knew the seeds were for real. A wave of nausea came on fast so I put the bong down and closed my eyes to meditate. With eyes closed my field of vision was alive with roiling electric bands -- not very 3d but interesting. The nausea came on at about 5 min and left at 8 min. I continued to explore with the eyes closed and experienced rapid flashes and pulses that were very fast and colorful but impossible to tell what I was seeing. This peaked about 12 min into the experience. 



Open eyed visuals after the peak included sharp rich color, unique texture enhancement -- difficult to tell why it seemed unique. The only audio distortion I heard sounded like someone crinkling plastic wrap about a foot above my head that moved from right to left and was over within 2 seconds -- this happed around 4 minutes in. The main portion of the experience lasted about 30 minutes with a relaxed afterglow lasting another 45 min. The nausea with the raw seeds was intense but short lived. The overall experience was very positive.



Experiment 2) My mindset was relaxed and near meditative. I was curious however if the lime would make a difference -- I know lime is important in the snuff prep and I had read that the calcium conversion makes the body load less and the colors brighter. I was sitting outside in the backyard with my wife and dogs --it was a warm sunny day with nice clouds floating by. I took large hits holding for 20 to 40 seconds and again felt strange by the 3rd hit.



After exhaling the 5th hit I looked at the clouds and they were for lack of a better word DREAMY. They really were perfect! Magical. I took two more large hits, the material was spent. When I looked around the backyard all the textures of the plants looked spatially arranged as if a master gardener perfectly pruned everything. These were the same trees shrubs ect\ldotsbut very refined appearing. Even the bugs running around the patio looked arranged. A mild wave of nausea came on -- light compared to raw seed -- so I closed my eyes to breathe and the fireworks began.



There was depth to the roiling geometric shapes and when the flashing started there was depth and texture and every color in the rainbow. I still could not make out what I was seeing but every 7 or so pulses one pulse would last a split second longer and I could almost see ? What I still don't know but something incredible. There was a rush of euphoria during the peak at about 15 min and open eyed visuals were extended with some good green bud. The clouds would go from normal to dreamy and back -- this lasted about 40 min. My body had qi flowing through it, my third eye was bright and pulsing. The entire experience lasted about 1:15 mins I thought I was finished with the visuals but when I looked at my computer screen after coming to the house all the white backdrops were blue. Not light blue --blue blue. I slept like a rock that night --very rare for me.

  

I will not smoke the seed without lime prep --the difference was very noticeable. I look forward to the snuff (I prepared it the same but roasted the yopo to allow for fine grinding). 



Namaste,



Almega
