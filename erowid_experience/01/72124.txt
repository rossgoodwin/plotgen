I had two friends over to partake in some Amanita mushrooms that I ordered from an online vendor. I also ordered a variety of other legal herbs and psychoactives. The amanitas were the main interest since they seemed tame and organic. We prepared ourselves by taking a vitamin C tablet of 100mg and a dramamine tablet of 50mg. None of us had any allergies to any fruits and none of us were taking any sort of medications that would interfere with SSRI's or MAOI's.



All of us ate some Amanita mushrooms. I had 4.1 grams, one friend had 4.5 grams, and the other had 5 grams. We waited a few hours and played Soul Caliber 3. I was very impatient after awhile and just paced the room. We all waited 2 hours before deciding this: the mushrooms were a bust. My quarter pound appeared as wasted.



We were intent on tripping on something. We wanted vivid scenery or any sort of visual. All of us had only experimented with simple drugs.



Recently I had been collecting web pages of experiences of the drugs I was to order. I had a lot of research on the amanitas and was most prepared for that one alone. However, I did have some pages that included experiences with Syrian Rue and Mimosa Hostilis. I had 1/8 of a pound of each.  Therefore I quickly found one that I had saved and mimicked the author's preparations. 



I had ground up 6 grams of Syrian Rue and 16 grams of the Hostilis. I used a coffee grinder I bought for \$14. I then went upstairs (we were chilling out in my basement) and used one of my mother's pots to boil four cups of water, a half cup of lemon juice, and the powder that I had just produced. After 15 minutes of boiling, I was still impatient and decided it was enough. The concoction smelled gross and I had read it was bitter as can be. We put in icecubes and prepared ourselves. Now for the crazy events.

Still having no effects from the amanitas we were prepared to feel some good visuals. No one expected anything extreme. We all sipped at once. I quickly spit out my gulp and stated that it tasted like puke. Everyone agreed. 



My gag reflex was going nuts. I did not throw up while drinking any of it. The one friend managed to choke all of his down. We used some Kava to help. We had mixed some Kava and water and let it sit in our mouths. We had read that it numbed the mouth so we assumed it would help. It didn't help me.



Once my one friend had downed his, he was at the point of no return. I was intent to trip. I used toothpaste to coat my mouth and gulp it down. I had used this trick to gargle with salt water when I had throat irritations as a child. My drink was spilled 3 sips in. Small sips. So I asked the other friend who had taken about 2 small sips of his if I could have it. He stated that it was nasty and he did not care. So I drank his instead. I noticed some nasty solid stuff at the bottom so I would dump the glass into another, and wash out the previous one that had gunk. I had done this about 3 times and soon there wasnt any solid or fiberous gunk. So after numerous coatings of the mouth with toothpaste, I got my drink down.



Now, my friend who also drank it, I won't describe his experiences, lets just say, he got what I wanted, and I had an unhappy trip.  The sitter helped me through the bad parts, but I don't feel like describing it too much.



So, I was laying on the couch after drinking the brew. Within 10-15 minutes, I started feeling out of place. An odd feeling, hard to describe, almost like being light headed non stop. I got the ringing in my head that I get when I stand up too fast and get light headed. I believe it would be the low blood pressure that this stuff does to you.

I was drooling non stop. All over myself. Soon I was very unaware of my own body. I got off the couch and sat on the floor. Felt safer. Sat there for about 10 minutes. Maybe more. I have no clue. I had previously gotten a bucket in the middle of the floor in case I or my friend needed to puke. I felt like I was riding a fast rollercoaster. The floor kept moving towards me. The lights were vibrating. I was afraid. My mindset was all wrong. I knew I would have a bad trip and being pessimistic may have been what had done it. That or I had taken way too much for my body weight.



So, floor moving at me, lights vibrating, I was afraid. I kept speaking in quick spurts. Like, `AwwManIdontFeelsoGood.' I would then stop and think about how weird I felt. Then `IdontQuiteLikeThis.' I was getting to be incoherent. The sitter would ask if I was ok occasionally, but he knew I had to sit through it and endure. I know that if things got horribly bad, he would wake my sleeping parents. I trusted him. 



Then the visuals started. It was like a Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas in my basement. Colors were all over. The ceiling was greenish and breathing. The colors of the couch and the patterns on the floor were melding together and spilling onto themselves. Then I knew what was to come. I had to vomit. I threw up a lot. It was violent and felt horrible. Right before I threw up I had started getting worse. My head was buzzing so hard I felt like I would blackout. I could not think any kind of thought. I saw maggots in my puke. The maggots were moving so fast. I looked away after I knew I was done throwing up. Closing my eyes was terrible, extreme sense of vertigo.



My other tripped out friend and the sitter went outside to smoke. They left me alone. I was pretty afraid alone. I got up to go outside. And I was going to puke again. I got outside managed some indistinguishable words, and threw up in the grass. I looked into the blackness of my backyard. The farm fields and grass were purple. The grass looked as big as tent spikes. I wanted to explore, but I was too sick to walk around. I sat and puked. I kept telling the sitter that I did not want to die. I wanted to come out of this alive and that I hope I get to see my wonderful girlfriend again. We have been together about 1 and 1/2 years. Very serious. I considered calling her but decided against it since I know I would scare her with how I felt and how I gibbered. 



So I kneeled outside and the tripped friend went inside. The sitter was outside with me. I looked at my body and realized I was shaking. I knew I was cold but could not feel a thing. So we went in the house again. I lay on the couch covered in blankets. We had some Aphex Twin playing and I could really feel the music. I believe Buckethead was on at times, and it never sounded good to me until that night. So I lay there and talked to the sitter. I had a very different view on life. I could look at my life and past events in a whole different way. I had read people who had stated what I have stated before and pictured it. I thought I knew. But really, this was something else. I had not a clue to what they were talking about. But this was definitly it. I understood them now. 



So really, I realized how good my life was. I had friends, I had a job, I had a good girlfriend, one that had every single quality I could have ever wanted, my family supported me, scholarships were paying for my college. I had everything in my life going for me. And if I had done some drugs, that I had not researched enough, depending on what it was, I could have nothing. They aren't illegal. But it was intense and dangerous. I was extremely dehydrated from the throwing up.



The TV moved around a lot. I had colors all over. Walls moved. Faces that were hardly there would appear. Then be lost in the swirling textures. The blue screened tv was too intense to look at. Blocks of color popped out straight at me. When I listened to the music I could close my eyes and get visuals from it. All in all, after the puking and fear, it was amazing.



But I cycled through the trips again, 2 more times. They were not as intense as the first one. I did not feel nausea anymore. 4:30 in the morning, 2 and 1/2 hours later from drinking the brew, and I was thinking clearly again with just a few things moving here and there. A few colors where they weren't supposed to be.



I went to bed feeling extremely exhausted.



Well, that was last night. I woke up this morning with a headache. It could be from dehydration. And my mouth was peeling and I have little taste in my mouth. I can't taste much, but throughout the day today I have gotten some of it back. Could be from the Kava. Could be from the puking and stomach acids. Could be from the enormous amounts of whitening toothpaste I had coated my mouth with. Could be from all 3. The other friend who tripped did not use toothpaste and didn't use as much Kava as I did. He also did not throw up. His mouth was fine he stated.



I have a new outlook on life. Bad things aren't worth getting upset about. I treasure my life with new meaning. I really wished that I had researched it more before I did it. It is nothing to play with. I may do it again in the future. But I would only use half the ingredients that I ingested. It was worth it for the new outlook I see things with. I recommend lower dosages than I had taken, for someone at my body weight. My other friend was 180 lbs and he was fine.



But really, it felt like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas at times.
