A little bit of background: I'm a fifteen year old girl, I live in Toronto and I've been smoking pot for a year now. Over the summer I've done ecstasy, ketamine, and DXM numerous times. I'm careful with drugs and although my family disproves of them I'm not going to stop. I enjoy the experiences because I believe they have something to offer. The closest things I've had to hallucinations was when I ate a hash brownie of GREAT quality (was fucked out of my head for ten hours). It was the only time I ever ate a whole one.



It was a normal friday night for me and my friend (we'll call her kron). Find a drug to do, chill at my house and get fucked. Being sick of DXM, we decided to buy some more Gravol. The first time we bought it we fell asleep before anything hit us. We got 500mg for three dollars at Shopper's Drug Mart, and still had some leftover from the last time. It was a perfect night for trying a new drug, as my mom was in Niagra Falls and my dad wouldn't be home until later that evening. Only my brother was home, and all he did was play video games.



At around 8:00 we took the pills. I had 10 (500mg) and kron had 15 (750mg). We made coffee and I had a cup and a half of that instant stuff (I don't drink coffee, but it was really good that night for some reason). We were instant messaging and on $\sim$*Myspace*$\sim$ when my dad came home about an hour later with pizza. We sat down at the table to eat, not feeling anything, and when we finished we both stood up and WHAM. It just hit us. I felt dizzy, but grounded and heavy, unlike a DXM high. I had no trouble communicating and except for the slight awkwardness of walking I made it downstairs to the family room without my dad noticing anyways. We both collapased on the couch and looked at each other and we both knew something was happening. 



We decided to watch an episode from the second season of House, who we both love dearly. I got steadily dizzier and as it was an episode I had already seen I decided to concentrate on the effects of the Gravol instead of the show. I started seeing smoke rising off objects, and unlike the usual `corner of the eye' visuals I get a lot (from the DXM no doubt), the smoke and other visuals kept happening even if I focused on the object. Moving my arms felt really weird, and my mouth WOULDN'T CLOSE. I'd be staring at something, forget what I was doing before and my mouth would hang open. A few seconds later I'd realize how stupid I must look so I'd shut my mouth, and then forget about it, and it would open again. This kept happening. I looked over at kron and her mouth was hanging wide open as well. It was actually pretty funny, or would have been, if I had not been so paranoid.



I looked down at my couch and it had an aura. There were little colours and dots jumping off of it. It was pretty cool. The lines on my couch would also move and sway, even when I focused on them. I also saw white flies everywhere. Just to let you know, I'm probably the worst person in the world to be doing hallucinogenics. I'm terrified of spirits, and objects moving by themselves. But strangely, while on DMH I felt way calmer than I should have--the paranoia seems to have only been there in retrospect. 



About a half hour of this and House was over. For some reason we decided to go down to my basement and watch another episode. As I got up from the couch my dad came down and told us he was going to bed (or something like it) and I saw my mom with him, just her head and chest, just below my dad, like she was peeking out behind the doorframe. She was wearing this pink shirt she always wears. It took me about a minute before I remembered my mom was in Niagra Falls that weekend and it was actually a hallucination. I got more paranoid and questioned whether I had even seen my dad come down.



In the basement, the auras and flies stopped but shadows began to jump out at me. I was facing the furnace as well as the TV, and I kept seeing people behind the furnace, even though I knew they weren't there. At about 1:00 AM we decided to go to bed, as I had to get up for a baseball tournament at seven the next morning. My heart was racing as I lay in bed, and needless to say I couldn't sleep. So I lay there for about two hours and enjoyed the feeling in my stomach. I could have sworn I was on E, it was that good. Kron was also tossing and turning, and would sometimes blurt out words or tell me to `go away' even though I never spoke to her. I was also hearing her talk, but I was in a good state of mind and could tell it wasn't actually her speaking. After a bit she fell asleep and I got up and walked around a lot, going to the washroom for cigarettes and drinking water, and talking to my friend I'll call Bebe about a kid she likes. This was probably the reason for the later `delusions' I had. Occasionally, I'd walk in front of a mirror and examine myself. My eyes were very wide, I looked shocked and my mouth was STILL open. I didn't notice any change in pupil size, although they don't get big anyways.



About half an hour later, I went back into my room and lay down again. I know for a fact I did not sleep until around five, because my eyes were open the entire time and I could see the clock and hear kron breathing. It felt like I was asleep, though, because I kept thinking I was at school and skipping keyboarding. I didn't mean to, I just kept forgetting I had to go to class. Also, me and Bebe were stalking the kid she likes, and Bebe asked him out and he refused. I also kept thinking I was on the subway, and I kept missing my stop and went back and forth between Pape and Kennedy about ten times before finally getting off at Kennedy. I just couldn't shake this feeling of restlessness and forgetfulness. the entire time I was lying in bed I kept thinking I had something I had to go do, but I could never remember what.



I actually did fall asleep then, and at about 7:00 AM my brother walked into my room and woke me up saying my baseball coach was at the door picking me up. I was late by that point, and felt burnt out, so I went to the door and told him I thought I would throw up and was in no mood for baseball. He was pretty mad but I was still feeling the gravol a little and I wasn't about to go out. I went back to bed until noon. When I got up again I was very disoriented. I kept thinking that bebe actually did stalk the kid she likes, and gave him flowers or something. I asked her that morning and she told me she didn't even see him the day before. I also asked my brother if my mom came home during the night, because I remembered her saying she was cold so she came home. Anyways, kron went home and I felt scared and paranoid the whole day, but I went out at about 5:00PM to a concert I had been looking forward to for a while (The Johnstones, very upbeat ska) and got really drunk and had a great time. I probably would have been depressed for a while had I not gone out, though.



All in all, my first actual hallucinations were pretty good, although I could have done without the confusion and depression afterwards. I wouldn't recommend doing this too much, though, because I did it about a week ago and I still have pretty bad visual distortion from it (mild Hallucinogenic Persisting Perceptual Disorder, I guess). Lights are very big and I see lines everywhere. When I get really tired, objects appear to move back and forth, and I have a hard time focusing now.
