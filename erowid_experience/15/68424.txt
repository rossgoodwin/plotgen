I have always been attracted to plants in the Solanaceae family, and daturas in particular.  I've worked at a local nursery for over 10 years where we have sold Angel's Trumpets, and recently datura metels in double purple and double yellows.  Although I'd experimented briefly in the past with some of the seeds, I had always respected the plants too much to mess around with them.



A few months ago I moved out West and purchased a beautiful Brugmansia plant for a steal of a price.  She was huge and fully budded, and I felt so fortunate to have found her!  However, once she bloomed I made the mistake of thinking to experiment.  My brugmansia bore gorgeous apricot-colored flowers that filled our whole apartment with an intoxicating scent.  My roommate even claimed that the scent was keeping her from studying.



One night after she had fallen asleep, I had drank several beers and decided that this was my time to experiment.  I was settling into town quite well, had made some good friends, my roommate included, and was enjoying my job. Things were going quite well, and I was generally feeling quite good about myself.  It had been a long time since I'd last tripped on anything, as I'd been hoping to do so once I attained my present state of mind.  All seemed well!  I had the next few days off, so I ate 2 leaves off my plant after the roommate had gone to bed clueless (bad idea).



I'm one of those odd people who likes the taste of shrooms and so the taste of Brugmansia leaves didn't mean much to me.  Anyways, from here it goes downhill, FAST. After consumption of the two leaves I was playing around on the computer, about half an hour, and strangely could hear the plant calling to me, through the walls of my room.  She wanted me to eat more, a flower this time.  My very last memories of this experience involve wandering around to the living room, and nibbling at least one flower from my plant. Evidence of the next morning would suggest that I'd eaten several.  I remember dancing, spinning in circles around the room, and nibbling at the flowers.



I woke the next day around dinnertime, 6pm.  My roommate's boyfriend was visiting for the weekend.  Strangely, I was feeling quite refreshed and chalked it up to (thankfully) passing out early the nite before. Wandering out into the kitchen, I was suddenly possessed of a lazy hunger and started making instant mac \& cheese.  My roommate surfaced from her bedroom and asked how I felt. 



`Okay,' I laughed, just a bit uneasy. `Makin some Mac \& Cheese. It's all good.' Then, a bit apologetically, `I ate some brugmansia last nite and tripped pretty hard.'



She was silent for a while, very unlike her and then said, `You did, did you?' I caught on to the tension in her expression and asked, as nonchalantly as I could, considering how much I'd begun to shake, so what exactly happened?  Her rather hesitant reply was `Well, a lot.' Keep in mind that we'd known each other not at all before the move, and had since become best friends, we knew all each others secrets, but I hadn't mentioned tripping on the brugmansia.  I recounted the last memory that I'd had.



My roommate filled me in on how I'd woken her in the middle of the nite screaming, various articles of clothing were clogging the toilet, the bathtub was filled with puke, and apparently myself (I know, totally fear \& loathing style). My poor roommate had to coax me out, naked except for a t-shirt, and while I was wandering mostly naked mumbling around the apartment she was on completely uncalled for cleanup duty.  It was about time for her to go to work, you see, and she kind of needed that shower asap, puke free. And the very last thing she needed was a roommate like me.



I wish I could remember more from this trip but it was one big blackout, and I awoke in the middle of a nitemare of my own construction.  I almost lost my home, and more importantly best friend and one of my few confidantes in the world. I still feel immense pain at betraying her trust and hope and pray that it doesn't happen again.  I don't remember much of this nite at all, only a fairly jubulant state of mind that seemed perfect for taking hallucinogens, and the lives of those innocents, my friends and family most of all, who have suffered for my crimes.
