Last night I took a pill that I knew to be `real' ecstacy (i. e. MDMA, MDA, or MDE) at a party.  This experience was noticeably different in many ways from all of my previous ecstacy experiences, and I suspect that this may have actually been my first experience with MDA.



---Setting



I went to the party in a happy, energetic mood and had been doing lots of dancing and eagerly awaiting the D+B that I crave.  Earlier in the day, I had taken 30 mg. of Adderall (Dexedrine and Benzedrine) to do some homework, and it had probably worn off but been replaced by the party energy I was working up.



---12:30 (T+0 hrs.)



I eat my pill.  It is a white, hard, roll, about the size of a double-stack, marked `XTC'.  It is slightly speckled, and has the definite bitter taste of ecstacy.  I had gotten the pill for free by going out and buying some for some girls at my school, who had told me that this was one of the `best pills they had ever taken', so I was awaiting a great roll.



---T+1 hrs.



Normally by this time I am blowing up or rolling balls.  My typical experience with XTC is that from 30 to 45 minutes after taking the pill, I am feeling nothing, and then the entire effect of it descends on me over a 5-minute span (blowing up).  However, at this point I am feeling nothing.



---T+1 1/2 hrs.



I start yawning noticeably and taking deep breaths.  I am expecting to blow up, but instead I feel the effects of the roll creep up on me over the next 30 minutes; there is no rush, but rather a steady increase in effect.  It is at this point that I start to feel `smacky'; i. e. it is hard to keep my eyes open at times, the nystagmus (eye fluttering) is insane, and I want to lie down; I leave for the chill room and almost fall asleep.



---T+2 hrs.



I am definitely `rolling' at this point, but it is different from every other time I have rolled.  First of all, my energy has completely disappeared, and I spend the next one and a half hours with my eyes closed propped up against a wall.  At several times, I try to dance, but usually find that I am not `feeling' it and don't have the energy, and end up sitting down shortly.  The empathogenic/entactogenic feelings that I associate with MDMA are also missing, and I feel more `fucked up' with an intense body buzz and psychedelic head-trip than rolly/lovey, but I am definitely rolling.



It is at this point that I notice the psychedelic effects of this pill; I am getting minor acid-style visuals (flowing surfaces, visual noise in the forms of dots and lines and flashes, slightly `digitized' appearance to surfaces) and also the afterburn effect that I associate with E (i. e. I close my eyes and the image slowly fades over a few seconds).  Also, I start to notice that although I can not dance to the D+B, I am feeling it in almost the identical way that I do while on LSD, i. e. I am breaking the individual beats and basslines down in my head, literally dissecting the music and becoming utterly entranced in it, although all I can do is sit back and bob my head rhythmically.



---T+3 1/2 hrs.



The smacky feelings have disappeared, to be replaced by a sudden rush of amphetamine effect.  The visuals and psychedelic activity are still going strong, and I begin to notice the happy vibes I normally associate with E that had been missing over the last two hours.  I spend the next hour getting back into the vibe of the party and doing some dancing.  When I speak of happy vibes, I mean not the empathogenic qualities (still missing), but that I am feeling vibrant and social, laughing and smiling quite a bit.



---T+4 1/2 hrs.



This is quite interesting.  We leave the party early (against my wishes) because my friend has contracted `raver disease' (runny nose, headache, etc.) and can not stand staying in the venue any longer.  While driving back to the city, I notice that I am feeling much like the giddy come-on to acid.  When I look back on everything, it was all a logical progression, but at this point I am very speedy (talking fast, etc.) and quite giddy, cracking lots of jokes and laughing hysterically, and just generally having a good time.  The minor visuals and a minor body buzz are still here; the general effect = happy + tweaking.



---T+5 1/2 hrs.



Once in the city, we stop for coffee.  My appetite is practically nonexistent, but I am downing coffee and cigarettes like a madman.  I am still cracking lots of jokes, and really getting along with these two people who had accompanied us whom I hadn't known before.  I also have the rolly eyes I sometimes see on ravers, i. e. dilated and wide open, almost like a staring zombie, accompanied by a giddy smile.



---T+6 hrs.



I get home, and I am basically feeling a warm amphetamine effect with the same minor visuals.  I still don't feel `cracked out', but rather that most of the effects have simply gone away.  As a precaution, I take several 5-HTP pills to help cushion the impact of the pill, and take a large amount of kava-kava to get to sleep.



---T+14 hrs.



I wake up, and I spend the rest of the day somewhat drained, but certainly not depressed\ldots  more surreal insomnia-style with mild giddiness, and I can still call up visuals on certain surfaces if I stare for long enough.



---My conclusions:



I inferred that the pill I had taken was MDA.  Several of the things that I had noticed have been identical to things I have read in MDA trip reports and abstracts; initial smackiness and powerful nystagmus, lack of empathogenic qualities, followed by amphetamine effects, and all of this combined with minor acid-like visual and mind effects.  If anyone has ever taken any of these pills or has some input, I would appreciate it.
