This probably looks like a really long report, but if you want to read a thorough, honest, average report on 2C-B, I highly suggest reading it.



I have been interested in research chemicals, especially the 2C-x's for sometime now. About 7 or 8 months ago a friend of mine ordered some 2C-I and he, along with quite a few of my other friends dosed it, having nothing but great things to say about it. At the time it was in circulation, however, I had only one mushroom trip under my belt, and didn't feel ready for it. I had been slightly regretting it recently, now that I am more experienced with psychedelics. 



A few weeks ago, an acquaintance of mine mentioned the possibility of 2C-B. A short time later, my friend who had acquired the 2C-I came into some 2C-B. I was very excited and bought the first doses off of him. He didn't have a scale at the time, so the doses were eyeballed and placed in empty capsules. They were supposed to be approximately 30 mg doses, and the effects seemed to be consistent with that. 



I decided to dose with a few of my closest friends, who I'll refer to as T, A, and B. A's cousin, D, who I haven't known for very long but am beginning to form a strong friendship with was also interested. None of us had dosed 2C-B before, everyone had taken mushrooms at least once (most about 4-8 times,) and everyone except D had dosed LSD before. I was likely the most experienced of the group, having taken mushrooms about 6-8 times before, dosed LSD 3-4 times, Ecstasy once, and many other substances from Salvia to amphetamines. 



The plan had been to go camping in the desert, about 2 hours away. D's father knew of the plan, but we didn't tell any other adults for simplicity's sake. The plan for the desert fell through when a storm arrived, with an 85\% chance of flash flooding. We decided, instead, to spend the night at A's mom's house. A's mom was out of town so we had the house to ourselves. We dosed the 2C-B at around 5:45 PM at A's mom's house. A few minutes after dosing, T, A, and B decided they were going to pick up some fast food and rent movies. D and I stayed home and played guitar while they were gone.



When the others came back from their errands, they put in the movie `Kung Pow: Enter the Fist.' This was a movie none of us had seen in a while, and we were just watching how weird and stupid it was. I had dosed first, maybe 5-10 minutes before the others, and I was the first to notice any effects. I noticed visual field distortions, and then, for some reason lifted myself up out of the chair I was in. I held myself in the air for a minute thinking how bizarre it was and sat back down. I was also laughing hysterically at this point.



A and I decided that the movie was too annoying, so we went out to the garage, where all of the weed and instruments are. Right when we got in there the others followed. We played music for a few minutes, but the rush of the come up became too disorienting for that. I sat down on a chair and hugged my backpack while D plugged in my 48' blacklight and started drawing on us with highlighter. We drew on each other's faces and chests, but I wasn't too into it at that point. I am very susceptible to nausea and very strange feelings on psychedelics, especially mushrooms and especially on the come up. I also often feel like my nose is running, even though it isn't. This is most pronounced with 4-AcO-DMT and mushrooms, however it did occur throughout my experience with 2C-B as well. 



At this point, about 1 hour in, I was very confused and the trip could have gone down a bad path. I had noise canceling headphones and my iPod, but I left my iPod in the car so I just wore the headphones without any music. This seemed to help a lot my reducing stimuli and calming me down. I had very intense Closed Eye Visuals at this time as well, and some mild Open Eye Visuals. There was a television in the garage and I decided to see if we could get any entertainment from it. I pressed a button and a videotape popped out, so I pushed it back in. Previews for movies came on and we talked as they progressed. Eventually, the movie came on, and we realized it was one of the Jurassic Park movies. We noticed right as someone was about to be eaten, and quickly turned it off and left.  I was really feeling the coldness and darkness and isolation of the garage so I was happy for the change of setting.



Once inside, I was definitely `tripping.' We drifted from inside the house to the backyard and the garage, and eventually wound up back in the garage. About 2 hours in, when I hadn't been in the house for at least 30 minutes, D and B were moving back and forth from the garage to the house while T was inside with A. Apparently A was freaking out, but nobody would tell me details because they thought I was tripping too hard. Eventually, I came inside and found I was the only one able to make a connection with A. He was really freaking out and he broke a chair and smashed a croquet mallet to pieces. I found out his problem and that he was having an asthma attack and needed his Albuterol inhaler, which was a 20 minute drive away and none of the licensed drivers of the group were in any state to drive. 



All of us, especially A realized the very real possibility of A dying, however, we were sure we could deal with the situation without involving paramedics, police, or parents. We tried to get a hold of D's father, who understands our situation, but couldn't. We eventually made contact with him and explained our story. He made it out to the house as fast as he could and made it in time. A happily puffed on his inhaler and we were all indescribably relieved. From that point on, we were able to really enjoy our trips.



We spent the next few hours around the house having a great time. We became incredibly interested in small things and physics. We discussed politics and our views on religion in very profound ways. That is one point I have to make about this substance, it is like amphetamines in the thinking processes and profoundness of thought. Every subject we dissected we came up with the most profound descriptions, solutions, and analysis for. During this time, I made my already strong friendship with A much stronger. We were able to really connect on the same level, which made any slightly negative effects of the trip 100\% worth it. We all sat around a table spinning coins and spinning strings of paper clips. We were all also very enamored with the radiator, as this chemical seems to have a chilling property, like a fever. 



We had many incredible sub-'trips' within the trip. Hopefully these can inspire you if you ever find yourself taking this chemical. The three most interesting `trips' within this trip were as follows. 



1. T, D, and myself realized the effects the drug had on our spacial skills, and that if we formed the shape of a box with our hands in the air, the idea of that box remained in the air. If we pulled our fingers apart as if we were holding a piece of string in between them, it was just as good as there being a real piece of string. This evolved into us creating shapes in the air and passing them to one another. As long as we all understood what we wanted them to be and how we wanted them to act, it was just as good as them really doing it, likely better. We played catch with an imaginary ball, which started to grow (by general consensus) until it was bigger than the house and it took all three of us spread out to hold it up. I reduced it to a tiny ball, left it hanging in the air, then touched it and made it disappear.



2. The visuals from this chemical are by far my favorite so far, easily winning over LSD and mushrooms. The entire night I had OEV's of fractal patterns all over the house, as well as fields of geometric patterns and depth distortions, such as breathing walls, shifting fields of vision, etc. Very often, my vision would slip so that everything was viewed as a light, soft fuzzy, slow motion image overlayed transparently onto itself and slightly offset (Sorry if that's a lengthy description, but it is perfectly accurate.) All night, objects and hallucinations were cycling through different pulsating colors. Anyways, to the point. I was slouching in a chair when I noticed the most incredible geometric pattern covering my black jeans. It formed with my legs and crawled up my grey hoodie. The pattern was so solid that I could have drawn it and was able to trace it with my fingers. It reminded me slightly of hieroglyphics or ancient South American patterning. It was a reddish brown orange and it pulsated. This persisted until I tired of it and stopped paying attention.



3. D and myself went into an empty room with a blacklight. We turned all other lights off and proceeded to draw all over each other's faces, chests, arms, and backs with blacklight reactive yellow highlighter. Some of the drawings actually turned out really well, and we danced in front of a mirror. Then we began to play music. We both predominately play guitar, and are forming a band together. There was a song we had been writing the past week that w and everyone who we played it for was blown away. Perhaps you'll hear it somewhere someday. As the trip began to subside and we were after-glowing (possibly my favorite part of any trip,) we were able to play the most beautiful music. D and myself played acoustic guitar, while A joined us on bass. T and B, as well as ourselves, were blown away by our playing. I played an improvised solo which I impressed myself with! I genuinely know that this wasn't just trippers playing guitar and thinking it sounds good. This time it was for real, and we played quite possibly the best music of our lives.



After quite a few hours, the trip trailed off and we just hung out, after-glowing pretty hard. When we were pretty much entirely back to baseline, it was only 10:15, when, on a regular night, we would be going out to party or something. Instead we drove to get food and watched a movie at home. I had some trouble sleeping that night, but I regularly have insomnia and tend to be especially susceptible to the increased insomnia from psychedelics and amphetamines. There were a few negative thought loops, but the ratio of trip intensity to negative thoughts and ego death was awesome. The mushroom trips I've taken that have taken me that far have always been accompanied by severe ego damage, which is something I can do without. This chemical still provided incredibly profound insight.



Thanks for reading this report, I hope it helps you. Overall, I really liked this chemical and prefer it to most substances I've taken except for LSD. For me, it 100\% beats mushrooms. Also, I'm able to get it for \$10 a dose, which is great. I am stocking up and buying at least 4 more doses this week, and my friend who orders it is ordering more next month :).



Peace
