I have a prescription of adderall, and I have been taking it for 2 years now to help my ADD, but I just recently (about 1 month ago) started getting high from it. My doctor told me that I would grow out of ADD after I finished puberty, and I think I have. Instead of aderall making me feel only more attentive like it did when I was young, it just recently started making me feel really trippy. And what's best about it is that my dad makes me take it in the morning, so I dont have to skeak around to do it. Llittle does he know he's helping me get the greatest high in the world, the `perfect drug', well almost perfect. The proceding illustrates my experience with Adderall during one of the first days of my new found pleasure, the good and the bad.



The day started at around 7:30 am. I took a 20mg in the morning, and caught a ride to school with a friend. After about 15-20 minutes after I took it, I was feeling very relaxed, kind of `comfortably numb.' Millions of thoughts were racing through my head, but all of them were good, and I was in control of them all. I smoked a couple of cigs, and then I was set. I got a big head rush, keeping in mind that I don't smoke ciggarettes addictively, maybe once or twice a week. But boy I tell you, I REALLY wanted a ciggarette. I dont know why, but there's something about Adderall that makes you hard-feeming for a ciggarett. When I got to school around 8:30, I found that as I walked to class that things just started to feel wierd with every step. Like I wasn't supposed to be walking at that point in time, but I had no choice. I was zoning out in class really bad, but at the same time I was aware of all the things around me, more aware than usual. The best way I can describe it is it was like my body was asleep, but my mind was well awake.



It's really easy to zone out and pay really good attention when you're on this stuff. It felt great. I felt like an emperor, a god even. I was on top of the world. I got out of first block around 10 after 10, and headed to `the tree,' where me and all my other hippie friends hang out. I had some Adderall with me, so I asked my friends if they wanted to try one. They each had a 20mg, and we parted ways to our second block classes. When I met up with them at lunch (around 12:20), they were all f*cked up, and we were having a real good time. It was like we all had this heavenly connection, and we embraced our high while we were under our tree, not givng a f*ck about anything. Then me and my good friend decided to pop another one, so we both took another 20mg. Well, after lunch, at about 1 pm, I went to my last block, and it was unreal! Half the time I didn't know where I was, and the other half I was the best student in the world. I took insainly detailed notes, and I understood everything before the teacher even said it. I had already drank 4 bottles of Dasani, and taken a piss numerous times. My body was yet again a relaxing numb sort-of feeling, and every now and then I would feel this very intense tingling sensation that started at my scalp and moved very slowly down to my legs.



When I got out of school, I walked, or stumbled, to the parking lot to get a ride home. In the car I popped yet another 20mg, and smoked a cig. I had a head rush from heaven! Everything was moving fast, but at the same time very slow. It is kinda hard to describe the way you feel mentally while on Adderall, I can say one thing though. I didn't have a care in the world. Someone could have shot me in the arm with a crossbow and I would have laughed at them for not using a gun. When I got home my parents were there, but I had total control. I just breezed past them like all was normal, except I still felt `comfortably numb.' Around 2 hours after I got home, the numbness went away, but I was zoning out really f*cking bad. I was like a vegitable, just sitting there staring blankley at my hendrix/morrison/lennon poster, thinking about everything in the world. 



Later that night around 7, my parents went out to eat, so I did a bongload with my bro, and puffed on a cigar. Doing this brought back the comfortable numbness and the sudden intense tinglings from head to toe until about 9:30. Then it was all down hill from there. In light off all the good things that happen to you when your on Adderall, coming down is a nightmare. That night my heart was beating like a racehorse, and it was beating so hard that I could see my Bob Marley shirt rising abrubtly with my heart beat. I was having anxiety attacks like hell, and I felt like I was going to die. I finally calmed myself down enough to fall asleep. I finally dozed off around 3 in the morning. I didn't eat a damn thing all day long. I did drink about 6 bottles of Dasani, though\ldots 

When I woke up, my heart was still going, and I was still really panicing. But after a long hot shower and about 3 hours of pure relaxation, I felt normal again. Well, almost normal. I was really fatigued all day long, and walking was a bitch. But after a day or so, I finally caught up on all my missed sleep, and I was feeling OK.



So, in conclusion, I would say that it is a REALLY fun drug to be on, but coming down is a really big hassel. It is insainly addictive, and I strongly reccommend that you do not do it 2 days in a row. I learned that the hard way. If you do, then coming down from the second day is twice as bad as the first day. Do it for a day, and then give your body a day to come down. Maybe even a couple of days. If you feel like you need the Adderall to function, stop taking it and any other drugs for a while, about 3 days, and then do it in moderation. Like I said, it would be the greatest drug in the world, it makes you feel better than any other feeling known to man. It would be the perfect drug, if it wasn't for the hellish-coming-down, the hunger and sleep loss, and the very high risk of adiction. 



ps. I would like to apologize for the numerous spelling and punctuation errors in this document, for I am curently peaking on adderall, and I am fucked up beyond all imagination right now, and I really don't care how it looks or how gramatically correct it is, as long as it tells my story clearly and understandably.
