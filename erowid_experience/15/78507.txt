After weeks of careful research and experimentation I discovered a method of ingestion that I find to be potent, simple, conservative, and tolerable to the stomach. I should stress that I have an EXTREMELY `weak' stomach that is made nauseous very easily, so it is with great sensitivity and care that I have come to recommend this method.



While many folks suggested cold water extraction, I eventually decided that this method reduces nausea just as much as it reduces potency. In other words, it's just a way to waste a little bit more material. That's why my method employs a more direct form of ingestion with an anti-emetic buffer for comfort.



The three key ingredients required for one experience were:



- Heavenly Blue Morning Glory seeds (from the Lawn \& Garden section) (between 14-21 grams on average, which is around 9-14 packets at 1.5g each);

- Dramamine Less Drowsy Formula (from the pain relief aisle of the pharmacy) or any other anti-emetic with the active ingredient Meclizine Hydrochloride, or `HCL' for short, at 25mg each). Only 4 pills at most are required. Most come in packs of 8.

- Unsweetened applesauce, enough for a good sized bowlful.



To begin with, I swallowed 3 to 4 of the Dramamine Less Drowsy pills with water. (I would've chewed and swallowed without water if they specifically said `chewable'). I took four of them at once with a meal to ease ingestion. I didn't eat for the next 2 hours. I began further preparation during this time.



Next, I washed the seeds in a bowl of cool water that had a few drops of dish soap in it. I did this for two minutes. I rubbed them between my fingers and against each other gently to remove any fungicides, dirt, or pesticides. I discarded the soapy water and put the seeds in a strainer so that they could be rinsed clean of any dish soap for a few seconds. I dried the seeds in paper towels and pat-dried them until they were air-dry. I did NOT blow dry them.



Once dry, I placed the seeds in a clean coffee grinder (pepper grinder is also usable) and ground them up as finely as possible. I didn't allow the coffee grinder's electric blade to get too hot by using it for too long, as excessive heat can break down LSA molecules. And I didn't take forever, either, as prolonged exposure to light can degrade the active alkaloids in the seeds.



Once pulverized, I stirred the seedy dust into a good sized bowl of nice, chilled applesauce. THIS TIME, I DID NOT BEGIN EATING THE APPLESAUCE UNTIL 2 HOURS AFTER DRAMAMINE INGESTION, AND I TOOK ANOTHER 30-45 MINUTES TO EAT THE SAUCE SLOWLY. Otherwise I'd barf up everything including the Dramamine, just like I did when I started munching the seeds too soon or too quickly. The seeds made the applesauce look dark and unappealing, but they really just added a hint of `nuttiness' to the mix, and the taste is actually pretty pleasant, especially when compared to direct seed chewing.



A half hour after I finished eating the applesauce I smoked some cannabis and went for a bright and sunny walk, feeling nothing aside from the usual marijuana enlightenment and an ever-so-slight, body-based threshold vibe from the applesauce. After walking around the neighborhood for what felt like 45 minutes, I began questioning the potency of the seeds I bought. My body began to take on a sluggish pace, and the body trip was coming on strong, but I felt upset that I wasn't seeing too much in the way of visual hallucinations.



When I got home, I saw that only 15 minutes had passed, not the 45 minutes I thought had passed. Within this small span of time my visuals had begun to escalate noticeably, and they were GREATLY amplified when I came inside from the sun and stood in my dimly lit apartment. I discovered that this is the type of trip that was begging for music and very low lighting, if not darkness altogether. So that's what I gave myself for a while.



At a total of two hours after the last bite I knew that I was at the peak of my trip, although I found it odd that my system took so long to digest things. Just like with LSD, I felt sensitive to loops and patterns of sound, sight, cognition, and tactile sensations (strange and intense `body trip' feeling). The main differences between its effects and those of LSD were that the seeds act as a much more potent sedative, while LSD provides more colorful daytime hallucinations.



During these next few hours I ate, smoked cannabis, listened to music, stared at art, and soaked in the goodness of the experience. It was surprisingly pleasant, as opposed to the many negative reports I have read. I noticed that both psychedelic music and visual art had a magnetic appeal to them, and enjoying these things instantly made the experience feel, look, and sound far more intense. At around 10 hours after ingestion I went to bed still feeling the effects, and slept nice and deeply for 10 or 11 hours. Very different from LSD!



The only negative effects were felt in my legs in the form of a cramp for about one minute once. It wasn't very discomforting and was easily walked off. Also, I felt a little gassy at one point, probably due to applesauce being full of fiber, but after a quick poop I was on my merry way again.



The next day entailed some sluggishness on my part, and I even felt a little shaky for the first half of the day. Not sure whether this was due to vascular constriction or low blood sugar. Overall, though, I still felt great the next day. Also, smoking cannabis the day after yielded a mild resurgence of the previous day's trip. Nice!



Everyone's body chemistry is different, but this method of ingestion seemed like the best way to settle a gentle stomach while still giving this trip veteran an experience powerful enough to satisfy my hungry soul.
