I just wanted to give you a heads up on this `new' drug, (new is a weird word in this business these days - new chemicals popping up almost every week!) 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone, or in short MDPV.



FYI - This can be seen as a retrospective look on this drug, or at least its effects on me



There isn't much to be found about this on the net, only a few reports, using very small dosages, and a forum - where most of them are either doing 100mg, and staying up, while wanking, for 90+ hours, or calling it a mild stimulant, a tad bit stronger than modafinil. What most of the few sources agree on is: This is a stimulant drug, with dosage levels ranging from as low as 2 to above 50mg in extreme cases.



So, being the curious personality I am, I had already ordered 30 x 200mg of Modafinil - a tryout, perhaps for making those long days at school less rough, I decided also to order 500mg's of MDPV.



When I got the little baggie of MDPV, I realised how hard this stuff would be to dose -- the zipbag was plastered all on the inside, with sticky parts of the brilliant white substance. Well - I tried to weigh it off on my cheap 0.001 eBay weight, and it turned out ok, but was quite a hassle. Started off low. I have learned that overdosing is NOT a game before, and starting low is a definite routine of mine. 2mg was on the table, and I was rolling the note. I am not used to snort drugs, but the taste of even 2 miligrams was in-your-face nasty. It had a earth-like taste to it, and the backdrip was disgusting. After a few minutes, I felt a clearheadedness, but no real rush. Can be descriped as a subtle, but more effective caffeine dose.



This was the beginning of my MDPV career. After a week, I tried 5mg. This turned out to be ALOT better. The first time, I almost felt the euphoria of MDMA. Reading on some of the information on the net, this was called the `2 hr coke rush', and ppl said that the effects was gone after approx. 3 hrs.



Not!



There was no sleep at all that night. During the following week, I caught myself doing MDPV around 10 times, some only for the clearheaded-feeling, but 3-4 of them doing ammount up to 10mg, to get even higher. I found that I could not get the high as euphoric as the first time, so I just did more! One day I did 3 x 10mg over an afternoon - again, no sleep for me, and a resulting crash that was so horrific, yet subtle, that I did MDPV already next day again. In retrospective, I had become sort-of addicted. Without noticing it, MDPV was messing so much with my mood, that I just did it again \& again to feel better. Result = days of feeling down, or beside myself, or craving the white powder so much I did it again.



All this went through over 5 weeks. I sold approx 100mg to some friend that wanted to try it out, and some loved it, some didn't. This short addiction got to me, in the middle of last week. I felt so down, and at the same time wanting to quit MDPV (at least when I was high) that I decided to go do MDPV an afternoon. I wanted to feel the euphoria in a nice setting, out in the sun, with nice music in my ears (have to say that music is really a BIG catalyst for MDPV euphoria).



I lined up 10mg. Snorted, waited for effects. A little physical rush grabbed my body, and I felt that clearheaded freshness once again. No euphoria though. So, lined up 20mg, snorted. Felt better. A huge euphoric bodyload now took over, and I felt greeeat for around 45 minutes. Then the high shifted, into a amphetamine-like state, euphoria coming off. This was actually common for a 5mg dose, in the beginning, what kept me up \& not sleeping! I was NOT satisfied, so I lined up 15mg more, snorted it. Euphoria stroke in 5 minutes later, almost as strong as before, but I could feel that this was not a good idea now.



Fuck that, no turning back. After 50 minutes, a last 15mg redose, and I went home. Turns out I have almost emptied my baggie of MDPV now. Oh god. Here comes the amphetamine rollercoaster. I felt like speaking to everyone, which was odd. My cousin \& his parents were in my house, having dinner, while I was mega-anxious. Felt like I had done a abnormous amount of caffeine, and was coming down. There was only a few hours till bedtime, and I knew there would be absolutely no chance of sleep.



Family went home, I had to do some homework, and around 1 am I decided that I had to go to sleep. While turning in bed, struggling to get some sleep, I was mindlooping to a point where I would call it either a psychosis, or a psychedelic flashback of some kind. I was talking to myself, while talking english. My mind was bound to define what I had done through my day, spoken in science-form. You know, reading wikipedia-style about something, very odd language, and very `square'. I could not get out of it, it kept returning to talking these terms `What did I do, what was scientific suggestionable in this situation etc'. Made no sense at all.



So, I got no sleep. I was very close to staying away from school the next day, but I only had 2 hrs that day, so I got up, and went there. Looked VERY pissed that day, looked like shit as well. Told everyone I had no sleep because I did homework all day. Talked all the time that day, about everything. There was NO filter on my mind, just had my mouth going all the time, about everything \& nothing (aka - it made NO sense). After I got myself some sleep, this confused state, which I can descripe as the feeling LSD leaves you with - confusion and too many thoughts to handle, was finally over.



Today I am DONE with MDPV for good. Never doing this shit again. I know I was doing stupid shit while on it, and was too addicted to see. Glad I didn't have several grams of this lying around! Normally I'm the harm reduction-guy, but this time it just got the better of me. This can be a wonderful drug at times, but the euphoria is fake as thin plastic. Not at all like MDMA, which is very spiritual and profound IMO.
