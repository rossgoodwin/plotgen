7:30am 150mg of Wellbutrin

10:40am 150mg of Wellbutrin

7:30pm 360mg of DXM

10:00pm 3 bowls of marijuana



It was a Friday, I had just taken a big exam in my ACCY 207 class at 5pm and was totally worn out mentally from it. At around 7pm I got really pissed because I was bored and my hookup for marijuana fell through so I was going to be out of luck for the night. I decided that since I wasn't going to get my bud for the night I was gonna get messed up somehow. So in all my wisdom I go out to the local convenient store and bought a bottle of robitussin maximum strength (360 mg of DXM). Just as I was getting closer to taking it I got this really bad feeling in my body and head and something was telling me that I shouldn't take this bottle of robo. I decided to go against these signs and take it down anyways and just sat around and waited for the DXM to kick in.



At around 8:30pm I began to feel the DXM kicking in and at the time I was in my room and it felt pretty good so far. I went into my friend Br.'s room who I usually always smoke bud with to chill for a while. He told me he had a bunch of bud for the weekend so I was happy because bud usually always goes well with DXM. I've had some really cool experiences (minus going to the hospital for a bad DXM trip) before so I figured that I'd chill in there for a while. All my friends on my floor in my dorm knew I went to the hospital for DXM before, unfortunately many of them were there to see my stretchered away. Br. could tell I was already fairly messed up so I told him I took 2 hits of acid because I knew he'd kill me if I knew I had done DXM again. So we sat back and started to watch ``Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas''. Up until we smoked the 3 bowls the trip was fairly uneventful, I just felt out of it and my emotions were not really effected too bad except for the fact that I was worried about people finding out about me being on DXM and not acid.



At around 10:30pm I realized that I needed to drink some water because I've noticed through experience that if you don't keep yourself hydrated while on DXM the trip can go real bad real fast and it can have hellish effect on your body (such as the DXM breaking down your water-based fat in order to gain water which has happened to me before). Since there was no water around I glugged 3 cans of Pepsi and for a little while was relieved because I had drank something. 30 minutes later my body had processed the Pepsi and so I had to go urinate, the only problem is that while on DXM I can't urinate unless my body is well-hydrated and when I went to the bathroom and sat down on the toilet I couldn't go as expected. I was sober enough to feel that my bladder was totally full though and so I decided to try the old put your hand in water trick that makes you piss involuntarily (I've seen it done to people where they pass out from drinking and someone puts their hand in warm water and they end up pissing in their pants). Unfortunately I forgot that it has to be warm water and I put cold water instead and it didn't work.



When I finally felt that I could go nothing happened and it felt like I had no bladder at all. Since my bladder was full it couldn't take anymore fluids so it got backed up into my stomach was in my body in general so the excess fluids in my body made me feel that my bladder had indeed burst and I started freaking out big time. Periodically I tried to reassure myself that it was just the DXM messing with me but in fact there really was excess fluids in my body. My bladder was just fine, a little full but it was just fine. It was then that I started running around asking people if my bladder had burst and if I appeared bloated. At that time the people on my floor knew something was up and my friend B. asked me if I should go to the hospital to which I quickly said no because I was there a month ago and I really had no desire to return. Then he asked me what I had taken and I said LSD because I didn't want to admit to anyone that I had screwed up and done DXM again.



After a while it started to feel worse and I was feeling the fluid buildup all over my body. It seriously felt that there was bile and other waste that gets sent to the bladder all over the inside of my body. What sucked was that it really was the truth, maybe not the bile but there was definitely an excess amount of fluid in my body. When I started to sweat the sweat smelled like urine which freaked the hell out of me, it was at this time that I decided to suck it up, admit I screwed up and admit the truth to a buddy of mine T. who knows more about these drugs than anyone I've ever met that I had downed a bottle of Robo. He reassured me it was the drug giving me the illusions of my bladder bursting. At the same time B., Br. Were there when I told T. what I had done and I could tell they were angry. What sucked about this trip and made it different from the hospital trip was that I was sober enough that I was aware of how angry everyone was and then my emotions were that of total guilt and anger towards myself. Unfortunately the DXM mixed with those emotions made the trip 10 times worse and the negative emotions and memories of the hospital incident came back to me as well. At this time I seriously was beginning to wish that I had in fact died the night I went to the hospital.



After going through this for a while my friends left me to deal with this myself and told me to wait it out until the DXM wore off and then they would have a serious talk with me about what I had done. When I was in the bathroom I tried unsuccessfully to urinate again. All of a sudden it happened I began to feel that relief (you know, that relief you feel in your bladder when you've had to piss for a long time but you had to hold it for some time and you finally have a chance to piss) but instead of urinating regularly it came out through the other end. It turns out that there was so much fluid that my stomach, intestines, and rest of my body had been filled up with fluid since I couldn't release it through my bladder. I must say that freaked the hell out of me again but at around 12:30am I began to notice the DXM beginning to wear off so I went to take a shower to speed up the process. I was beginning to feel more hopeful about my condition but I felt absolutely horrible about letting everyone down.



I took my shower and for me there's a transitional phase I go through when the trip starts and starts to end where I begin to tremble and my eyes blink rapidly for a minute or 2. After about 5 minutes the phase started and just as it ended I felt like I was puffing up like a balloon and all of a sudden my pores opened up and my body expelled all the fluid that was built up inside. I could tell this was for real because my pores looked strange for a few days afterwards. I turned off the shower and began to feel the urge to piss again. I ran straight to the stall, sat down and finally was able to urinate. I pissed for a few minutes and I could feel all the fluids draining from my bladder and organs and I began to sober up completely and I came to the realization of what I had done that night, had a nervous breakdown and cried for a while. I have since sworn to never ever do DXM again because that could have been a very bad situation and I lucked out again. 



It has been over a month since I've done DXM and I feel much better but one of the drawbacks to combining buproprion and DXM is that unlike a lot of people who trip from DXM I remember everything very clearly, especially the bad parts. I don't ever plan on doing DXM again unless for some reason I stop taking Buproprion but that is extremely unlikely.



I really don't think antidepressants and DXM mix very well.  For me the risks are not worth it (and I nearly lost my friends to it). Tripping is fun but it's not worth losing something truly important just for the sake of tripping.
