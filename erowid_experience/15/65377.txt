This is an account of my 6th Ayahuasca experience, it was a breakthrough experience and definitely report worthy. To start I'm 6'1', 160lbs and I'm 19 years old. I'm a fairly experienced psychonaut, having used a nice amount of Mushrooms, LSD, 2C-B, Ayahuasca, Mescaline, 5-MEO-DMT, Bufotein, Nitrous Oxide, MDMA, Salvia, Cannabis, and different combinations of these and various other substances. I've experienced Ayahuasca several times before but I never felt I had got the full experience. On this particular occasion I decided it was time to finally take a journey through my consciousness, to voyage places foreign and far beyond anything recognizable in this realm of so called ``reality''.



I started by brewing up some Ayahuasca early on in the afternoon around 2. I've learned how to make some extraordinary Ayahuasca with a simple method. I start by weighing out 20 grams of the Mimosa Hostilis root bark on my digital scale and the put it in the blender to powder it so the DMT will be extracted more thoroughly. I put the root bark in a 1-2qt pot with 1000ml of water and 1 tablespoon of 5\% acidity Vinegar. I bring it to a boil and then turn it down to a simmer. I let it simmer until the water is down to about a half cup to a cup and I stir it every 10-15 minutes. Then, once it has cooled I strain it through a cotton t-shirt. I put the used root bark back in the pot and repeat two more times. But on the second boil I use 750ml and on the third I use 500ml.



After that, I put the liquid from the boils back in the pot, let simmer until the water reduces to about a half cup to a cup and let cool. This whole process takes anywhere from 3-5 hours. So I finished this around 6:30, thinking this was to be a solo journey, I get a call from a friend of mine, who I will refer to as J, asking if I wanted to hang out because another friend of ours, who I will refer to as A, was bringing some Cannabis. So of course I said yea and I told J my plans for the evening. He has attempted Ayahuasca on three other occasions to no prevail, purging before feeling the effects so he wanted to try again, and A had never tried it so I was happy he was coming over to finally experience DMT.



They both arrive at my house around 8:30 and we begin by taking 3 grams of Syrian Rue seeds. The seeds are pretty gross so I have a special little method I do to reduce the taste. First, I separate the seeds into 6 piles more or less a half gram each. Then, I take an index card, bend a crease in it, and scoop up one of the piles. I pour some drink (preferably root beer) in my mouth filling it half way, pour the seeds on top of the drink, take another small sip, and swallow them like a pill.  Although, the seeds do have a tendency to float to the back of my throat sometimes. We do this over the next half hour and then after taking the last of the seeds, wait about 30 minutes before taking the brew.



So about 9:30 we take the brew, I had a cup made so I just split it in thirds. All three of us hadn't eaten anything really all day so I figured we'd have a better chance of not purging but yet again J vomits before getting visuals, though this time he did get the body high from it. Both A and I held ours down long enough to smoke a couple bowls of Cannabis to calm our nausea. After smoking I started feeling some light effects of the DMT, seeing this layer over everything that slowly moved and morphed.



I was kind of frustrated knowing I had made a good batch of Ayahuasca and I wasn't feeling strong effects so I decided to boost it by smoking a bowl with some 5-MEO-DMT/Bufotein on top. I own a Bufo Alvarius toad which has blessed me with quit a few crazy moments. I took a huge hit, held it for as long as possible and was tripping before I blew out the smoke. WHOA MAN!!! I must say this was an intense ride. The visuals were real liquid, and flowing. I remember looking at the floor and seeing all these different mandala wheels and hieroglyphics and weird symbols. While the body high is sooo intense, it feels like my body is an empty physical shell for my spirit though void of its energy. Truly amazing and it really does have that near-death feel because the come up is so quick.



Having the MAOI in my system really made the effects of the 5-MEO-DMT a lot stronger. The visuals were much more vivid and lasted much longer. Though I did notice the lack of colors and the multicolor, ever-changing, energy fractals I see on Ayahuasca. I walked to the kitchen and this shock went through the top of my head and ran down my spine sending a warm tingling sensation through my body. Then I felt as though I was a beacon sending and receiving information almost like a central point for energy to go to.



After about 30 minutes to an hour of tripping on the 5-MEO-DMT, we smoke a blunt of Cannabis. I start to notice a slow increase in the effects of the Ayahuasca but still nothing mind blowing like I was expecting. Another hour goes by and it starts to feel as though the DMT is fading. I'm pretty disappointed at this point but I'm still high off the Cannabis and I start to get the munchies. So I eat like four croissant rolls and all I can say is eating must have started my stomachs digestive process and digested all the DMT that was sitting in my stomach at once because it hit me HARD. And before I knew it I was tripping harder than I've ever tripped before.



Everything before my eyes became a manipulation of reality to another degree I had never witnessed before. It became an array of constantly changing, multicolor, energy in the form of shapes and designs in numerous patterns flowing into me as if I was absorbing the energy from everything that was around me. It became so intense to the point I feel my eyes being forced closed so I can witness the true potential of DMT. As my eyes are closing I begin to see this DNA helix spinning toward me, then it bursted into an infinite amount of fireworks and as the fireworks are erupting, a magician, decked out in the full attire top hat and magic wand included, appears above the fireworks, waves his wand and BAM!!! I'm teleported to the DMT room, which to me felt like I was in a cube where the walls had the same constantly changing, multicolor effect the energy I see with open-eyed visuals has.



In the room it was like a circus with all these carnival rides and these beings (almost like the beings I've seen on Salvia), that were so excited that I was there with them. They were just so happy and were more than welcoming, ecstatic to be showing me around this strange yet familiar place. I zoom through all these rides seeing all these ``people'' more like spirits of people laughing and enjoying themselves, and I feel as if everything is energy, pure positive energy. That energy is what's creating everything before me. When instantly, I'm flowing through the universe seeing all these different stars and planets and galaxies.



I stop and begin to hover in this weightless void, then the beings show me this chunk of a planet with this enormous oak tree on it floating in space, then it begins to disintegrate almost as if on fire. The beings tell me with this symbolism that humans are destroying the planet and we need to work together in harmony with the planet for the better good of everything and to keep a peaceful balance. Then I'm off again flowing through the universe. The beings take me to this blue planet that looks just like earth only more like if earth had never been touched by man's cruel hands. We went in for a closer look flying over the planet looking at all the different plants and creatures that inhabited it. The planet was so earth like in design, it was more like a prehistoric earth, full of natures beauty, no buildings or structures of any kind.



I visited this large swamp area with these huge dragonfly things that were more dragon than fly which was inhabited by these big salamander-slug looking things. They had a salamander body and head and slug eyes but no back legs.  As I was looking at one, another one shot it's tongue out and ate one of the dragonfly things. I was awed in amazement at how similar things were on this planet compared with Earth yet utterly unfamiliar. A lot of the creatures I seen on the planet looked more reptilian or amphibious than anything, though there were some other creatures that were kind of similar to some of the creatures on earth but completely different, some just crazy looking.



There were these weird fluffy, flying creatures that reminded me of Atreyu from ``The Never Ending Story'' but they looked more bird-like. They were white and had furry, feathery wings and gigantic paws with sharp claws almost like you might picture a gryphon but not quite.  Then I seen these furry caterpillar-like creatures that were big enough to ride on. They had white and golden fur that parted in the middle, black beady eyes, and black fur covering just their feet. They would waddle around being real playful with one another, almost like puppies. Enormous, fluffy, puppypillars! After I had stayed on the planet awhile I was lifted back through the atmosphere into space, the whole time I felt like I had accomplished so much. While floating there the beings told me that Earth could be peaceful like that planet if we all worked together to stop the destruction we are causing by using the planet, and not abusing it. People need to focus their minds on the positive aspects of everything, we should appreciate everything down to a single breath of air we take because just the fact that we exist is a gift. Life isn't about the things you possess, it's about the experience.



The DMT began to wear off and as it did the universe wrapped itself in a sphere and whirled away. I opened my eyes and felt like I was an entirely new person. I had truly experienced DMT, that was the kind of experience I had been looking forward to from the moment I heard of Ayahuasca. I mean that was definitely a WOW experience, a true mind blowing, consciousness expanding, outer body, otherworldly, psychedelic journey. I have experienced many mind altering substances in my life but nothing and I mean NOTHING even comes close in comparison to a full blow DMT trip. I will definitely be traveling to that place in my mind again.



As for A's trip, he experienced light visuals the entire night but said he had a very religious experience with God, finally understanding the true meaning of love and how love is pure positive energy and that energy is God. I'm really glad he finally got to trip on DMT, he has opened his mind to infinite possibilities and said he will definitely be doing Ayahuasca again.
