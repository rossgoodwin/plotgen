And the trip begins\ldots



Ok so I had order 50 (thought the package I got actually had 60 in it) Hawaiian baby wood rose seeds as well as a 30 bag of weed. The plan was that me and my friend whom I shall call B were going to go over to his house (he lives with his parents) and trip while the rest of his family were up at their cottage. Well because it had been raining all weekend they didn't go. We got the go a head from his mom to chill there and do what ever any ways. So at 9:30 B came over to my house where I had the seeds crushed and ready to be put in some water and drink. We placed our doses into our cups. I told him I was only taking 15 (though I later revealed the truth\ldots  I had taken 19), I had crushed up 10 for him. So we drink the water making sure to get all the crushed seeds as well, I made sure to chew mine up real good before swallowing. 



We head out and decide to stop to a gas station to pick up a Philly so we could roll a blunt. The gas station that we patron is about 15 min away from my house. Well after about 10 min on the road I could feel my stomach tightening up and nausea setting in. I tried my best to think of something else but all I could think of was not puking, which only made the pain worse. We arrive at the gas station, I asked B to go in because if I stood up I knew I would hurl. It felt like forever that he was in the store; every second I could feel the pain growing. He finally arrived back to the car and we started to head over to his house. The roads seemed so bumpy; every bump we hit made me feel worse. As soon as we get half way back to his house B asked if I was feeling any thing because he was starting to feel his stomach tighten up as well. I just nodded. We arrive at his house and his mom was in the drive way. He got out and walked over to her. They talked for a moment. This got me mildly paranoid. B walked into the house to get something and she just walked past the car and said hello. This made me feel better. Not sure why but it made me feel like I was going to be safe here. 



B arrived back to the car and started to roll up a blunt. While he was doing this I had a rushing sensation growing. I was feeling really confined. I got out of the car and took my jacket off. That helped a bit. When I sat back in the car I left the door open, I had to if I shut it I felt like I was going to be stuck in the car. B finished the blunt and I asked if we could smoke in his old van, he said no but we could smoke and walk around his property. B lives out of the city so there is nothing but woods really around us, there is a slight hill that they keep mowed but it's still more of a field than a yard\ldots  we walked over to a spot amongst some trees. It was kind of closed in but I felt like I was in the middle of a giant field. As we stood there smoking I felt the nausea go away and the rushing sensation take over\ldots (I should note that it was now about 10 pm and it was dark out. It was slightly raining and the ground was completely saturated.) 



The world started to glow; every thing seemed to be becoming alive. I started to sense the trees calling me; I started running about from tree to tree greeting each with a hug. B seemed very amused by this. He hadn't started to trip yet, but he would follow me around and keep trying to keep me still. But I was in no way able to stay in the same spot, the world was calling me and I had to answer back. I was laughing uncontrollably at this point, just completely taken over by bliss. I felt as if for the first time in my life I was completely free.



B suggested we head over to a clear spot in some trees on the edge of his property, as we headed over hallucinations really started to take hold. I started to see small animals running through the bushes; the sky turned a greenish color and as we walked up the slight slope to the spot in the trees there was water running down the hill from all the rain and with light from his house at the end of the hill reflecting off the water I became under the impression that the field was a lake. This impression was only intensified by the fact that there is a ditch that runs through a part of this field as a form of run off for the water and for some reason I kept finding my self standing in it knee deep in water; despite B's greatest effort to keep me out of the ditch.



We finally reached the spot. It was amazing surrounded on all sides by trees and I felt each of them reaching out for me. I was just running around touching all the trees and plants I could; it was as if I could feel their life force.  We were still smoking the blunt at this time; I would guess it was maybe 10:25 to 10:30 pm now, though I am not sure I lost all sense of time. I then stated that I needed to cross the lake to the other side. I am not sure if B realized I had mentioned the ``lake'' but he agreed that we should cross the field (note: I will be referring to the field as a lake until the time passes).



We as we headed out of the trees to the edge of the ``lake'' I become very worried of drowning. I took step after step at a very slow pace. Even though there was no real water depth I felt that with each step it was getting deeper. By the middle of the ``lake'' I felt as if just my head was sticking out of the water. B had already reached the other side of the field and turned around and asked why I was going so slow, I replied that the water was too deep. B just looked at me and asked me to hurry up. I continued my slow progress across the field. Upon reaching the other side I noticed an old swing set that seemed to be a boat. We headed over to it.



B climbed up to a platform and I just climbed up the ladder and hung on. It felt as if my body was under water and my head was just popping out. I am not sure how long we hung out here but it wasn't too long I believe. After this we made our way back to his car in the driveway. This is when the trip got really strong for me. As we sat in the car I got the feeling of confinement again and I started to freak out a bit. I kept jerking and shaking. I think I might have even broken some part of his car, not really sure. I finally realized I had to get out of the car, I would get out of the car and head off back into the trees then return to the car. I did this for while.



I do not really remember much of these little adventures, except that I would come to standing alone in the middle of a small wooded area and find my way back to the car. While I was doing this B was trying to roll a blunt with no luck. He finally gave up and we both decided we should sit in the garage. We sat in there talk and shit. I was having a real hard time sitting though, I wanted to walk. After a half hour or so of trying to keep me sitting B gave in and we headed back to the first spot we went to when we smoked.  I do not remember much of what went on while we were out there this second time. 



The next thing I remember is deciding to go inside, which turns out to be a bad idea. As we walked into his basement I felt fine, not confined or anything. But as soon as we got up stairs I started to feel really confined and kind of paranoid. We decided to watch a movie so he put in Ghostbusters. I tired to sit down relax and enjoy the movie but I couldn't sit still. My trip was still at full force. I moved from seat to seat in the living room but I couldn't get comfortable. I started to freak out. I couldn't handle my trip at this point I wanted it to end. I asked B if they had any orange juice because I felt this would help stop the trip (don't know why.. just did) any was he got up and went over to the kitchen. He then walked to see if any one was in the next room (At this point we had thought maybe his sister or some one was up on the computer in this room) and as he went in he stopped looked around and walked in slowly. I started to think maybe his mom was up and was talking to him or something. This made me freak out.



I got really nervous and felt like I was going to threw up. I started to think that we were fucked. Then I started to think of all the bad shit in my life right now and then started to think about having to confront my parents and talking about my use of drugs. B came out of the room and I ask him who was in the room. He told me no one was in the room but this news didn't make me feel any better. The panic had already set in and negative thoughts where now manifesting into physical pain. I told B I had to puke, I ran over to the small bathroom in the other room and shut the door. By this time I had already broke out into a cold sweat and my heart rate had increased ten fold.



I immediately bent over to throw up into the toilet, but nothing came up. I just dry heaved a few times. I leaned my head on a window and rest my self against the wall. I was having all the bad thoughts you can have. I was imagining B panicking and getting his mom or something. Having to go to the hospital getting my stomach pumped (even though I knew they would not do this, it would be of no help). I pictured my self having to talk to my mom at the hospital, how disappointed she would be in me. I started to feel depressed. I felt as if I was dying. I turned around and leaned up on a sink and looked at my self in the mirror. I was white/grey. I looked as if I already was dead. Sweat pouring down my face, my eyes red and all pupil. That's when I realized it.



I was on drugs and freaking my self out. I stood up, looked at my self and I was ashamed that I let my self get carried away. I started to say to my self ``it's just the drugs, dude you are on drugs\ldots  relaxed.'' I took slow deep breaths. I almost immediately felt better. I opened the door and stepped out. I had stopped sweating but I was soaked. As I slowly made my way threw the kitchen back to the living room a feeling of total bliss and euphoria a million times stronger than I have ever felt started to set in. I sit down on the couch, looked at B and said ``dude\ldots . you have no idea\ldots . what I just went through''.  Just then I knew I had just gone through the worst moment of my life. Everything I can think of up to that point seemed so small in turmoil compared to my 5 min in that bathroom. I was alive and for the first time in my life I was happy to be so. 



I was exhausted now but in a state of total relaxation and bliss. I would have to say from this point on the trip took on a feeling of MDMA more than anything else. In the sense that I become very empathetic, I had an extreme mood lift, I felt complete; it was as if every thing in the world was now right. I lost all sense of ego and became very raw and pure emotionally. I really can not explain what I fully felt. The experience was simply beyond my comprehension of reality. It was like I shifted into an entirely different level of existence, a higher plain of spiritual being. For once in life I was living beyond the social BS, I was limited only by my willingness to express my self. I realized all the things in my life that has been keeping me down and I realized that now is the time to change them. It was as if I was supposed to have taken this trip so that I can see how blind I have been in life. It felt as if a weight had been lifted off my soul, a feeling that has stayed with me sense. I learned a lot that night. 



The Aftermath



I got home at about 4:30 am that night. I was totally exhausted yet still tripping quite heavily. I was extremely hot and could not cool my self down; I drank plenty of water and had my a/c on full blast. I tired to sleep but with no luck. I did end up falling asleep for a few hours. How ever upon waking I was still tripping mildly. I spent most of Sunday lying in bed coming down. I still wasn't able to sleep much last night and I feel completely fried today..
