I am a 21-year-old female who is very athletic and in excellent health.  My previous experience with psychedelics includes psilocybin, LSD, ketamine, MDA, DMT, and 5-MeO-DMT, all of which I am moderately to highly experienced with.  Other psychedelics that I have experienced once to a few times are AMT, DPT, 5-MeO-DiPT, and mescaline.  Over the past couple of years I have been for the most part avoiding tryptamines as I have grown tired of the body load and long tail-end effects.  For the past five years I have been fascinated by the psychedelic phenethylamines, but have been cautious about experimenting with them until more information became available.  During this period, I have had the opportunity to try 2C-B on several occasions, but always passed it up as the time did not feel ``right'' for me.  The following account is of my first experience with this compound, which occurred a few days ago.



The 2C-B has been carefully weighed on a scale accurate to 1 mg.  My fiancé Karl and I are each planning on taking one capsule with 15 mg of 2C-B.  This will be my first experience with this compound and Karl's third.



The setting for the evening is a rented cabin on a body of water far from densely populated areas and far from our home.  The scenery is gorgeous, unfortunately the cabin is a little run down, but we both feel very at peace here.  Neither of us has eaten for approximately six hours and even though we do not feel hungry our stomachs are for the most part empty.  Karl is on no medications and I am on only a low-estrogen birth control pill.



[T+0:00] Feeling a little bit anxious, I wash down my capsule with some water.  After swallowing the capsule my anxiety dissipates.  There is no turning back now.

[T+0:30] Karl and I are sitting in the cabin listening to some music and I am beginning to feel slightly mentally ``weird'', but it is so slight it could be a placebo-like effect.



[T+1:00] Karl and I have re-located to a spot outside where we have a nice view of the water.  At this point I can tell that there is definitely a phenethylamine in me.  Physically I feel very warm and relaxed with a slight buzzing in my body.  Mentally I feel very clear-headed and happy with a small amount of euphoria.  The sun is beginning to get low in the sky turning clouds shades of pink, red, and orange.



[T+1:30] I am still feeling mentally and physically excellent, but I have become quite restless.  I feel mentally sober except for the fact that details are standing out at me.  I look down and analyze every single thread of my sweater.  I am hearing undertones that I have never noticed in songs that I listen to often.  



[T+2:00] My restlessness has only increased, so Karl and I walk out to the pier and gaze down into the water.  So far this has been pleasant but I begin to think if things don't pick up soon that I am going to be disappointed.  It starts getting windy and cold so we start walking back to our cabin.  Mentally or visually there is still no indication that I have ingested anything (except for acute awareness to details), but as we are walking back I look at the cabin and see the roof raise up and fold into squares like a sheet of paper.  Unbelievable!  With LSD and psilocybin I get visual distortions and patterning on things before I have any large-scale hallucinations.  But with 2C-B, I got hardly any visual distortions or patterns to accompany large-scale hallucinations!  Throughout the night I went from having hallucinations to feeling sober and vice versa many many times.



[T+2:30] Back in the cabin we put on some slow-tempo electronic music, which sounds amazing.  I am surprised, as music usually annoys me on most psychedelics.  I also find my favorite seat for the night: on the bed in front of the window looking out at the water and the mountains.  What is strange is that when we have the lights on nothing is out of place and I feel sober.  But when we turn the lights off I start to have incredible visuals.  There are some lights across the water that start flashing and turning different colors.  Karl tells me that they are actually white lights and that they are not flashing (and I trust him, because his experience leveled out with the body buzz and the acute awareness to details.  He had no visuals of any kind).  I see the skyline start wavering and watch the mountains rise up higher and higher until the sky is almost not visible.  The mountains then drop down to their original height, allowing me to view the clear night sky.  The stars begin to spin and streak across the sky and begin to connect to each other with red lines to form a web of stars.  These types of visuals progressed for the next 2.5 hours and did not get any more intense than what I have just described.  



I also have access to memories and emotions in my past that I am not comfortable with and I can easily push them out of my mind.  This experience is controllable, which is good, because at several times I am hit with certain thoughts or ideas that could have escalated into something terrible, but I could simply choose not to continue with them.  Time has slowed down immensely.  I can't believe it has only been a few hours as it feels like the whole night has gone by.



[T+4:00] I am beginning to ignore my visuals as I get the urge to talk and think about people and matters in my life.  I begin to dissect and analyze things, which end up confusing me.  I then start taking components in my life and begin to put them together into one big whole.  They start to make a lot more sense to me.  The universe feels very small (or maybe it is me that feels so large?) and I feel like I can access anything.  One thing about this experience that is beginning to get on my nerves is the lack of description and words I can find for the thoughts I am having.  I am making so many connections, but I can't put them into words, a problem I have never encountered with other psychedelics.  Maybe the clear-headedness is causing this difficulty?  Or maybe psilocybin, LSD, and DMT are superior at helping one verbalize thoughts and connections?  



[T+5:00] The prominent visuals have ceased and I begin to realize how distorted the things around me now look.  Karl seems disproportionate: one side of his face looks bigger, as does one of his arms.  I look in a mirror and my pupils are doing the strangest thing.  They constrict and then pulse and get a little bigger and then pulse and get a little bigger until they are dilated and then they constrict and the process starts over.  I am now also very aware of how physically uncomfortable I am.  My skin feels sticky and clammy.  I am getting a headache and some slight nausea.  I try to drink some 7-Up and eat some crackers, but I can barely taste or smell anything.  I bump my elbow and feel nothing.  I can't believe how numb my body and senses have suddenly become!  The cartilage in my neck keeps cracking when I move my head, but the way it resonates makes it feel like the cracking is happening inside my head, which is a little disturbing.  I also did not produce any phlegm or mucus, but I did have a small problem with my sinuses continually popping and creating a rushing air feeling and sound in my ears.  These physical side effects were completely absent until now, and I find I can block them out by talking to Karl and being silly.  I get the giggles pretty badly and say some pretty nonsensical things for a half hour or so.



[T+6:00] I am feeling tired and lie down in the bed next to Karl.  Holy shit it is the most uncomfortable thing I have ever been on.  I have slept on floors that were ten times more comfortable than this bed.  It also doesn't help that the sheets are coarse and scratchy and the pillows are hard and lumpy.  I still see some patterning, and things still look pretty distorted.  



This is when my worst physical side effect began and it was impossible to ignore.  I started to get some muscle spasms and tremors, which were annoying as hell and which also contributed to me having some anxiety.  When I closed my eyes and tried to ignore them I found I could not keep my legs still.  Looking back on this, I am not sure if the cause was physiological or psychological.  It is possible that I may have been deficient in magnesium and potassium.  But it is also possible that as I became more and more bored and uncomfortable with my surroundings, impatient to get to sleep, and frustrated with the uncomfortable bed, this triggered some moderate anxiety, which caused me to spazz out for a couple hours.



[T+7:00] I am still being bothered with some physical discomfort but I am mostly ignoring it now except for some muscle spasms.  At this point, my open-eye visuals consist only of rainbow splotches surrounding things (like water droplets with oil in them).  I lie down and close my eyes and decide to try to ride the rest of this out so I can fall asleep.  This is my first opportunity to explore the CEVs.  They are unlike any I have experienced with any other substance.  They are three-dimensional patterns that are grey, black, dull yellow, dull red, dull blue, and dull green (almost like Lego colors and patterns).  Some random images also pop into my mind of people I know morphed with insects and other strange creatures.



[T+8:00] I am back to baseline but I am anxious and have some aftereffects that keep me awake for a few hours.



[T+10:00] I finally fall asleep!  



I was only able to get 4--5 hours of sleep after the experience, as we had to be out of the cabin by a certain time the next morning.  The day after, I was mentally and physically exhausted, but I also had a very strong positive afterglow, which tapered off over several days after the experience.  



\underline{Afterthoughts}



Some day I would like to try 18 mg and then maybe after that work my way up to 20 mg.  Next time I will also make sure that I have been getting plenty of potassium and magnesium so I can hopefully avoid having muscle spasms.  Because of the restlessness 2C-B caused in me, I would say that it is not necessarily a substance to be taken in nature or solitude.  I really found myself longing to be at home around friends and pets and in an environment I am more familiar with.  I also believe it could be a fun thing to experience at a club or concert (at a low to medium dose).  



2C-B is one of the most unique substances I have ever taken and it definitely had a personality of its own.  Even though I didn't really have any deep insights, it was still enjoyable (except for the discomfort at the end).  At a medium dose it could be a good introductory psychedelic.  However, I would also caution those who really rely on their mind clearing up as a sign of coming down from a substance; because with 2C-B, one's mind can be relatively clear the entire time, which can lead to anxiety near the end from wondering when one is going to finally come down from the trip.
