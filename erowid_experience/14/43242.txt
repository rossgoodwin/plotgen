It was a planned assembly of friends, a gathering of 7 people. I had invited two of them to be introduced to Foxy (5-meo-dipt) by my friend (we'll call him steve). So they dosed as well as me with 20mg each. I had also brought another friend, we'll call her nikki, but there wasnt enough foxy for her so she was the guinea pig for the 2c-c steve had scored. She loved it, my two friends loved the foxy, thanked everyone for the positive experience and went home. 



At the tail end of my foxy trip, steve decided to go to bed and I talked him out of giving me about 60mg of his 5-meo-det to play with while he slept. I gave nikki about 10mg and I snorted the rest. Now here's the experience report. First off I'm going to say, 50mg is ALOT. I'm going to set my personal safety dose chart at 5-10mg for threshold, 10-20 for common, and 20-40 for strong/heavy. I have no clue what the lethal dose is. Another thing I want to say is that unlike alot of psychedelics, if I took more of this stuff than I intended, and I got higher than I intended, it seems a lot less likely for me to have a bad trip, to experience fear, paranoia and all the other bad effects from taking `too much' because I was COMPLETELY out of my mind, even had a mystical experience where I was unaware that I even had a body. Lets start from the beginning\ldots after the burn from the insufflation became tolerable, I started getting high about 2 minutes after. I decided to lay down and throw a cool black and blue knitted blanket with sparkles up in the air, catch and throw it up in the air, over and over again, because underneath, the blanket looked like the sky, the sparkles being the stars, and so it seemed I was grabbing and crumbling the fabric of the night sky and tossing it up and down. 



I got higher and craved music, so I put in stone temple pilots, tiny music. I put it on lady picture show and sang along to the song and almost cried out of the recieved audio beauty/comfort. Then I woke steve up with the loud music and he came and yelled at me to turn it down, so he went back to bed and I said, fuck it, I'm going for a walk.' So I left and nobody knew whether to follow me or wait for me to get back, so they just did nothing. I left and very rapidly lost all memory of who I was with, where I was, who I was and where I was going at the moment. At first it was mildly frightening, for like a second, then I thought, `well, I roam beneath the beauty of this wonderfully warm sun, with no past, and no purpose, no worries, no negative energy even fathomed, no body and no sign of potential bad experience. I waved at all the people I passed by, working on their beautiful yards. I was in such a DEEP state of care, and I appreciated DEEPLY all the beauty around me. I found beauty and appreciation in so much more. It seemed I almost accessed past memories when I studied the contours of a tree. Walking around parks and alleys and trails, all revealed beauty around me was so overwhelming, it seemed I needed to pay an hourly rate to even look at the flowers and trees and beautiful people and homes and the clouds and everything else containing beauty. 



I was told I was gone for about four hours. And when I got back, I was still too high to realize that steve's house was right there. They were just outside looking for me when I came back around. I dont know how I came back around to his house after FOUR HOURS, considering I was too high to even know where I was going or came from. But they yelled to me and it even took a second or two to realize who they were. I was a floating spirit indulging spiritual beauty and divinity for four hours, I came back to my body right as they found me. Much longer of a duration than 5-meo-dmt, I remember snorting that and only being high for 45 minutes or so. 



I just started low the first time I did it and explored safe doses and unstable doses to gain the knowledge to share. Peace, love and safety:)
