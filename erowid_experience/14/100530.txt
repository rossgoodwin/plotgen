As a first-time psychedelic user, I hope that this account will provide a unique and helpful perspective to those considering trying 25i, especially for those unfamiliar with psychedelics. I smoke occasionally and drink fairly often but otherwise am a healthy 21 y/o male with no previous hardcore drug experience.



Two days prior to my trip, I sober-sat for a few friends of mine who each took 1.5 tabs (1500 ug buccal). Most of them enjoyed their experiences but were very affected -- to a point that I wanted to avoid if possible. Some had very dissociative experiences and one friend kept talking to himself. Two days later, two friends and I decided to take one tab each and started at approximately 11:00 in the morning after having a decent breakfast.



T+0:00 - Took the tab (1000ug) sublingually



T+0:30 - First start feeling some very mild effects, similar to a weed high although less light-headed. I felt like I was shaking lightly, but that might have just been from some nerves.



T+1:00 -- Mentally feeling very high, although no visuals yet. Spat out the tab around here. I'm extremely relaxed at this point, feeling good and having typical high thoughts about society, friendship, myself, etc.



T+1:30 -- Visuals start to kick in. For the previous hour I had just been sitting on the porch looking out into the forest and I was able to get some tracers (I think that's what they're called) when I moved my hand quickly. I start to zone out hard core and my entire visual field becomes very active. Things are starting to move and swirl in my peripheries but when I turn to look I can tell that its just a moving leaf or branch. I played around with losing my focus and staring out into the trees and the visualizations would appear, each time a little more profound than the last. This progressed pretty rapidly from here. I would lose focus of my scene and the depth of the forest would become stuck in one plane (as in I could no longer tell depth of field or which trees were in front, behind, etc.). One small cross-section of branches would be the only thing to remain in focus in the plane and suddenly this cross-section would fractal out into my entire visual field, the same cross-section appearing, scattering out like a pane of glass slowly cracking. My whole view would be this one cross-section of branches repeated to my peripheries. If I held my gaze, one of the cross-sections would become colorful, with different bands of color (remember my backdrop was just trees and clouds so this was very different) and then the color would spread to surrounding cross-sections, shooting through my field of view. Then all of the cross-sections would turn blood red and start to melt together and flow down. If I stopped staring at one point and looked at something else, the scene would go away and I could tell that I was still looking at normal trees. It took effort to make the really intense visuals come on and with each turn my visuals got progressively more interesting and intense. 



T+3:30 -- After about two hours of playing with my visuals on the trees, clouds and some other stuff around the porch, I decided to move inside where my two friends had relocated. I really enjoyed being outside and felt very confident with reality and that I was doing a good job keeping myself in check. I spent about 15 min. walking around to get my bearings straight before going inside. It was very interesting to see how normal I felt when I was walking around and constantly shifting my focus.



T+3:45 -- I finally settled downstairs where my friends were listening to Pink Floyd (too stereotypical, I know) and just looking up at the ceiling. I laid down on the carpet with my back to this big stoplight lamp that was about 10 feet behind me and projecting into the otherwise dark room. I was really vibing to Pink Floyd and the lyrics. I was making deep connections with what they were saying and the messages that were coming across about society and life (``What did you dream? It's alright we told you what to dream'' really got to me) Like the previous experience of the trees, it took me a little of time to resettle and get the visuals again. 



T+4:00 -- As I'm laying down and looking up at the ceiling, the lights from the traffic light lamp are creating weird shadows off the small raised bumps on the stucco ceiling. Since each color was separated, the red light, the green light and the yellow light all created slightly different shadows. As I lose focus on the little bumps and their shadows, they start to separate from the ceiling and come towards me. It was like they all joined a plane and began to unstick from the ceiling, revealing the same ones right below it, and ones below that, etc. I would look away and look back and the dots would start to connect themselves in random patterns, creating various geometric shapes against the ceiling. Again, these shapes would detach themselves from the ceiling and would start to move, rotating in unison around a focal point. The best way I can describe it is that it looked like I was looking at Mayan symbols as they all rotated across a lunar landscape. The Pink Floyd in the background was still blowing my mind as I watched the unknown figures float gracefully across the moon's surface. 



At some point, my sober-sitter friend got in front of the traffic light lamp and started to move around a bit to change the shadows cast onto the ceilings. When this happened, the green shadows all moved in unison and appeared to turn thick like a smoke. The smoke moved across the ceiling and the dots formed images of monsters that frightened me. This was the only point where I felt afraid, but still welcomed the experience as it was again something new. My friend stopped and the lunar landscape visuals stopped as well. Now, when I looked up at the ceiling the bumps and shadows appeared to form a never-ending field of glaciers and icebergs. As I zoned out, the icebergs flowed and crashed into each other. I even heard the crushing of ice. I could direct the ice flow whichever way I preferred and moved them this way and that, hearing the crunching sound as they smashed into one another. 



T+6:00 - I became distracted and lost the glacier field visual and decided to move as I felt like I was losing my high. I went back outside and enjoyed the view of the forests and trees, although I was essentially done with visuals, especially to the extent that I had seen them previously. I felt very mentally exhausted, as I had essentially just spent the last several hours making art that my brain had never experienced before. I spent probably an hour where I was still at the level mentally that I was during the visualizations, but without the visualizations. I sat on the porch for a while and contemplated more about myself and my relationships, society, thoughts, and the human being. 



T+7:00 - My friends and I all went in the Jacuzzi after we felt that we had come down for the most part. I was back to normal mental capacity, but very mentally drained. I realized how body high I still was though and just sitting felt absolutely fantastic. We watched a gorgeous sunset over the forest and just chilled. Couldn't have asked for a better ending to the day. 



About four hours later I had little change in my state of being and went to bed. No visuals when I lay in bed. Woke up the next day feeling fine and mentally invigorated, like I had gone through some sort of liminal stage in my life and was moving onto a newer, wiser self. Overall, it was one of the best experiences of my entire life. I would whole-heartedly recommend it to any healthy person who feels that they can guide themselves through it. I feel like I faired so well in part because I had a very pragmatic approach to my thoughts and feelings, always reminding myself that I was still just in a house in the woods and was just looking at trees or a ceiling. That it was just my serotonin receptors going for a bit of a spin and that everything would be back to normal shortly. This kept me very grounded and comfortable for the whole experience. I can't emphasize the need for sober sitters that you know and trust as well. 



I hope this helps and/or incentivizes some people to try this experience. Sorry if it's a little long-winded, I was writing in part just so I could myself remember all of my thoughts and my visuals and so that I don't ever forget them.
