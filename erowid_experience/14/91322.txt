Frame of mind: clear headed and upbeat, no drug use for previous 24 hours.



Material: I have 5-MeO-DALT in freebase (which was the only version I could get) and decided against smoking it due to the putrid taste. Oral doses seem to be more easier to control and is my chosen method.



Subject: (me) 55 kg (121 lb bodyweight) - male



I measured up 21mg of 5-MEO-DALT freebase powder and ingested it in a gelatine capsule with water (at 10:20AM) food was consumed (lasagne) approx 1 hour ago.



+ 00:30 - feeling a slight bodyload which isn't at all uncomfortable also accompanied by a definite discernible head space, that feels somewhat `floaty'. Reminding me of the time I took some philosopher stones once. 



+ 00:40 - Sensations of a tingly energy is radiating from my core spreading through-out my body (the same kind of feeling I get when I'm excited). Random shivers are felt which just feels awesome the only thing that I can compare it to is like when I'm having an orgasm 



+ 01:00 - That floaty headspace feeling is coming on and it's relaxing. The only way to describe it would be spacey. Music does sound a lot better also, I notice that my hearing sense is sharper all of a sudden.



+ 01:30 - Feeling really spacey - my visual awareness feels like it's shifting. No crazy visuals to report although if I relax my focus things feel like they're moving ever so slightly. I also feel the urge to talk with people. This isn't acted upon however. I remain in my own world, content with being as I am. :) 



+ 02:00 - Still feeling pretty good - I decide to have a hit of cannabis. This immediately amplifies the spacey feeling - I put on some music and start dancing in my bedroom. Music sounds amazing! I just get lost in the music. Realizing that my co-ordination is still pretty good and my creativity's also flowing and I feel like one with the music. A feeling of blissful connectedness. I'm listening to some tracks created by phaeleh (you can find him on soundcloud), some very smooth shit man.



+ 02:10 - Random euphoric waves are pulsing through my body emanating from what feels to be my adrenal glands. These waves cause tingles in my body and feels really awesome. I wish I had a side-kick with me experiencing this as well, which I feel would make it much more fun. :) I think this stuff could be pretty fun in a club type setting.



+ 02:20 - Intense hunger feelings noted at this time. And respectfully ignored (LOL) as I'm having far too much fun dancing. I decide to crack open a V energy drink and continue dancing in my bedroom. I'm still feeling really feeling good at this point. I'm also aware of similar confidence effects to alcohol or MDMA for me. I feel like I can do or say anything - and who's gonna stop me? YEOW! :D



+ 02:30 - At this point I give in to the hunger feeling and decide to eat some mini chocolate chip cookies. Nomnomnom. The taste sensation is crazy. I'm not sure if this was from the weed or the 5-MeO-DALT, or even a combination of both but food tastes absolutely amazing right about now. I finish the whole box of cookies without realizing, until I get to the last one. Hmmmm, I didn't even know that I could be such a piglet - haha. 



At this point I'm sitting here relaxing and thinking that I can smell 2 minute noodles being cooked, just outside my bedroom. Which makes me feel hungry \emph{again}! Damn my room mate. (lol)



I quietly sip away at my V energy drink and continue contemplating. Still feeling good. My body seems to not want to sit still and I really have to consciously think about it to make it feel ok to just sit by my computer table. 



I draw my focus on the events of my current life. Where I'm going and where I want to be. Introspecting a little bit. I realize that I was raised up in a relatively negative environment since birth but I tell myself that everything's going to be OK. I'm sure of it. Because I will make it so. 



These thoughts set my mind at ease and I allow myself to be in the moment once again.



+ 03:00 -  the spacey feeling is still here and I continue to feel great (really upbeat, slightly euphoric), still feel like socialising although I'm currently at home alone and all my friends have gone to work. A cute girl texts me and I start thinking about her which puts a smile on my face.



The good feelings stick around until +04:00 and gradually and slowly tapers off - no harsh crashing or any comedown to note. An afterglow persists for a few hours also.



My General Thoughts:



* Very spacey, mellow and slightly euphoric (upbeat without being overbearing).

* Slight bodyload feeling that stays with me throughout the experience

* Easy to control mentally (steering thoughts and being in control of my mental faculties)

* Not more-ish whatsoever

* Makes me want to eat which is unusual for a tryptamine.

* Short lasting which is perfect - other tryptamine's can last a very long time duration wise (which may or may not be a plus depending on what you're doing)



Colours did appear more vibrant though as a psychedelic I feel 5-MeO-DALT is supremely lacking. Otherwise the general energetic stimulation, music enhancing and appetizing effects of this chem are quite important to note. There's no heaviness to the chemical's quality. It doesn't feel even the slightest bit overbearing like say LSD or a hard psilocybin trip can be.



The bodyload on my 21mg dose was manageable and never felt out of control, definitely not to the point of nausea. I really like the synergy between 5-MeO-DALT and a hit of cannabis. Makes me feel like dancing which I do normally love when I'm high and gives me a kick of energy.  The random tingles and shivers that borderline orgasmic were also fun. Gave me a feeling of excitement on the come up. 



Overall a rather pleasant experience that I would do again, next time with friends and probably in a clubbing environment.



Would I recommend it to people who love true psychedelics? No. The reason why is because it's nothing like a traditional psychedelic whatsoever. Visual voyagers will find it unimpressive.



Therefore, I feel 5-MeO-DALT will disappoint many and be loved by only a few.
