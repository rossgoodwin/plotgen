I had always wanted to seek answers via the mushroom.  Sure I had done them many times before, but I always got this nagging feeling that I was not truely expereinceing them. I was just relaxing with friends, and having a good trip with others.  While I'd be on trips, I'd always think `Imagine this by yourself, find your path, and walk it'.  So on my 24th birthday, I decided to do just that.



I told my friends, some of who thought I was nutso for wanting to trip alone in nature, and others who looked at me in a new light, seeing I wanted to grow as a human.  So we drove out to a beach/island.  I smoked a blunt with my friends who liked marijunana.  Then we injested some shrooms.  I took the largest portion about 1/8th maybe.  When I started to feel it come on, I asked my friends to leave me now, and that I would return hom sometime tomarrow.  At this point I was here in reality on a beach with my friends.  



Then they left.  I realized I was -alone- for once.  I was utterly alone, on an island away from everything, though I could get back to the city pretty easily.  Everything vanished, I was transported out of this dimension.  In the nightsky horizon I could no longer see buildings and city off in the distance.  I saw mystical things, castles, and other planets.  It was as though I was on an Island in the universe, and I could see everything around me.  I was no longer physical, I was completely in my spirit realm.  



I climbed a hill, and looked around at everything. I looked down at my watch, to see if time existed here. But mayan/aztec/ancient symbols flashed on it every second, changing. I didnt understand these symbols, but thats when I realize fully, I was completely somewhere else.  I walked down from the hill and went to the one opposite. I looked around here, something didn't feel right.



I was looking for something afterall, I came for the answers, to expereince this, what was I looking for\ldots  THE PATH. I look down the hill and see a path in the dirt.  I walk to the path and it is a fork. I hear a question in myself outside of myself, not really sure where, but the question `Human or Not'.  I say `not' and begin walking down one of the paths almost automatically.  Strange.  I come to various forks in the road, in which I am asked questions, I answer, and begin walking down the path that represents that.



Now for some quick background on me.  I don't consider myself `male' or `female', I also have very androgynous features as a person, and have lived my life part as a male and part as a female.  At the time of this trip, I had begin moving towards my true self, of androgyny.  But this trip set it in stone.  At one path, I am asked the question `male or female'.  I felt as though this would decide the rest of my human life, so I should sit and think about it.  I sat there, and began to laugh at myself `What a silly thing to think about, this is a trick question, the answer is neither'.  



As soon as I had that, I stood up and walked down the third fork which I didn't even see before.  Walking along, I could hear the mushrooms spirits talking to me about life and spirituality.  Things I can't even write here, because I'm not sure how to write them.  Finnaly I say `I want to see you'.  Everything gets quiet, and still.  Nothing is there.  I guess I wanted the spirits to materialize and show themselves to me. At the time I didn't get the fact that THEY WERE SHOWING THEMSELVES TO ME.



They are everything.  Nature is there, everything has a spirit and conscience.  Thats what the quiet was showing me.  I thought to myself `There must be more, show me more'.  So I just started walking, walking, walking.  Oddly I saw people.  Apparently I was not alone on this island.  These people looked at me discontently, and ignored me.  I walked more and more.



Next I was standing at what I call the `trip crossroad'.  I get this everytime I shroom now.  I can choose to go totally insane, and have a nightmare trip, or I can choose the `light path'.  What I was given a choice was this.  I was standing by the water, and I realized the spirits were `water'.  I realized all were spirits, everything nature was true.  To the other side of me was a white trailer.  In which three little identical bald men were typeing away on the computer.  As I walked around this van, I knew they were monitoring me.  I could feel as though everything was as scam computer program. My life, everything.



I realized, this is my paranoid delusional mind.  My dark troubles, my fears, the falsehoods, lies.  And the `water/nature' was the truth.  I could control which universe I lived in.  The dark lies and deception, my darker demonic side.  I admit, I have praticed many forms of  spirituality, and I had spent alot of time focusing on negative-energy.  The point of this mushroom trip was to find positive energy.  A lighter side to myself, because I tend to be a dark person.



Most dark people don't want to come into the light, for some reason I wanted to try both.  I had already had this `darker' trip before long ago.  I decided it was time for truth, to experience nature, to feel light.  I walked away from the white trailer, and I could almost feel my darker side of insanity go `Awwww, please come back.' as though I was letting part of myself die.  However I know what happens following the darker path in life, I've been there, and experienced enough of it.  This trip was to be my step into light.



By the water, I felt at one with everything.  I was water, the water was me.  The spirits of everything were all around.  I decided to keep walking down the shoreline.  I walked and walked and walked, no signs of reality existed anymore, just fog all around me.  I suddenly stopped, and felt beautiful.  I knew this was `my heaven'.



There were some funny strange birds from another reality playing in the water.. These are `my birds' I thought.  They symbolize part of me.  I laid on the sand, and slept.  I awoke several times, each time feeling in peace.  My spirit realm was eternally night time.  The stars in the sky were always beaitufl. All was good and calm.  I knew `I can stay here forever'.  The spirits reassured me, that If I wanted to stay, I would not have to go back to the horridly boring reality everyone faces. I could remain at `one' with everything forever.



This sounded great, but then the spirits asked `but have you done everything you need to do?'.  And I knew the answer was no.  The spirits told me `You can come back and visit anytime you seek answers, or direction, you do not need to stay'.  I knew I should not stay, there were people to influence in my life.  I had `good' to do in the world, that I had yet to do.  So I got up and took `the road to reality'.  Strangly enough it was a dirt road, that stood out from the fog.  Nothing around it.  I walked for what seemed like days, occasionally sleeping along side this road.  In my mind, time did not exist, in this realm, time has no concept.  Finnaly I started seeing bits of reality show up.  A trashcan here, a sign there, etc.



Then I hopped over this fence, which I knew was the fence separating realities.  Suddenly I was back on the island I started on.  I saw my car and walked up to it, it looked like it was speeding down the highway as I walked up to it.  When I touched the door handle, I saw myself inside the car getting into a car wreak! I let go of the handle immediatly and I was standing next to the car still.  I heard `there are things to do before you go, you will be safe if you do them'.  Then I realized I needed to clean up my area where I started.



Surprisingly I found this spot easily, and there was my blanket and various other things.  I picked everything up.  I heard the spirits say `leave us'. and I knew it meant the remaining part of my shrooms.  So I said a prayer and offered them to the earth.  I buried them on what I call `the veil between realilities'.  I knew if someone ever finds them, they were meant to find them, because of where they are hidden. Inbetween worlds, on the line.



I put everything in my car, and sat down in it. I heard `what time do you want to return?'  I thought 4am sounds like a good time.  So I put my fingers on 12 and 4 on my clock.  Suddenly the hands started spinning around and around and around until the clock said 4am.  Then BOOM, everything ended, I was shot back into my body and mind completely.  Everything was as if I had not takin shrooms.  The only thing that existed was an afterglow and a `knowing' feeling very spiritual and happy.



But the spirits left, and I heard `You will be safe driving now'.  I was back to normal, just like that.  It was as though I was out of space/time and I had the ability to choose when to return in.  I chose 4am, and when the clock hit 4am my trip ended, just like that.  I drove home, and was greated by my friends.  I have told this story a few times, and reactions are always differnt.



All I know, is after this `trip' my spiritual life has grown quiet light.  I have found things in spirituality that interest me.  I've had a huge spiritual growth after this trip.  It gave me everything I hoped for.
