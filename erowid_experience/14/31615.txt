Over the past few months I have been reading and trying to obtain Datura. My goal is to find a hallucinogen that has CRAZY hallucinations, and one that is easily obtainable. So I read about 90\% of the trip reports, and how almost all of them are negative but thought that I was above that. MAN WAS I WRONG!! I am going to describe what I thought might be a fun, short trip that turned into a long, loss of control.



10:30 P.M.- Feeling good, anxious, and ready to trip. So I start to make a tea out of 100 Datura seeds. I got a mortar and pestle out which had no effect at all in smashing the seeds. So I emptied out a green tea bag and replaced the tea with 100 halfway smashed seeds. Next I filled a glass almost to the top with water and stuck in microwave for about 2 1/2 minutes. Then my parents got home so I had to pause the process and pretend to be doing something else.



11:30 P.M.- Parents just went to sleep. Very excited. So I had to stick the water back in the microwave till it was starting to boil. Then I went into my room and dropped the tea bag of seeds into the boiling water. I let it set for about 10 mins. and then stirred it for about 20 more until it was cooled down enough to drink. Then I ate the seeds in the tea bag (sucked, chewed, then swallowed) and sat down with the drink.



12:00 P.M.- Ready to drink tea but decide to add some sort of bottled kool-aid drink to help with the taste (I dont really mind it but its not great). After about now I loose total track of time. I forget that there is  such a thing as time. So the rest of the times are just educated guesses really.



1:00 A.M.- Feel extremely disoriented and dizzy ONLY when I stand up. I found that to be odd. I was getting kind of tired and thought that I might not trip so I watched T.V. for a while and then decided to go to bed. Even though the effects were getting stronger and stronger, I was getting sleepy. I set my alarm for 5:30 just in case I made a mess or something like that.



5:30 A.M.- About half of the rest of this report was told to me or realized later, and the other half is ALL really blurry so it might sound wierd Supposedly, I woke up, turned my alarm off, and got into the shower just like I was going to school (it was Saturday). Well, I didn't get in the shower, I just turned it on, and left it on. When my dad woke up at around 6:00 he noticed it was on and that got him confused. Apparently, I fell back to sleep until about 7:00 A.M. Saturday.



7:00 A.M.- I woke up and to my suprise one of my friends was sitting in my leather deak chair and his girlfriend was sleeping on my bed. I kept talking to him and he never spoke back to me. His girlfriend was 1/2 asleep just kinda laying there so I talked to her. She never said anything back either. None of this seemed odd. I also saw my brother in my room playin X-box. So I went to get some water or something and came back and all were gone. Next, I went to my brother's room and he was dead asleep. Upon leaving his room, my stepmom started talking to me. We argued back and forth on what day it was. I would have bet anything on the fact that it was not Saturday, even though it was. So I gave up on that had breakfast and went to my room again. This was the zone for people to talk to me. Probably because I consider that my safe trip zone. Where I am always comfortable.



8:00 A.M.- Upon entering my room the same guy and girlfriend were there but then dissapeared. This seemed normal to me. I played music and X-box for a while and then realized that sitting behind me was my friend who was supposed to come over LATER that day. I hadn't asked my dad yet about him coming over so I went to. My dad seemed taken aback by this so he led me back to my room to show me that nobody was there. I was shocked! So shocked I made excuses of how he could of left my room. Then my dad looked at me and said `Don't you realize, nobody was ever there, you hallucinated him there.' This was kind of a mind-opener to me. I suddenly realized that all the strange crap that happened was not real. WOW! My dad left pissed off I had taken drugs and I sat down unhappy. Then all of a sudden I noticed about 3 random people lounging in my room as if they belonged there somehow.



I tried talking to all of them. I had already forgot that they were not real. Then one disapeared from the leather chair and I was screaming at it to bring that guy back! The chair actually smiled at me but said nothing back. I got over it quick and gave my attention to the X-box. Then I noticed people coming and disintegrating all from the chair. This went on until my dad came in to talk with me about doing this drug. I thought he could see the people in there with me so I was trying to play it all cool. When he left all the people were looking at me and smiling, even the chair. 



3:30 P.M.-If today was Thursday it would be time for me to go to rehab group counseling but it was Sat. I got ready and called my friend to pick me up to go with me. While it was ringing I realized that it was Sat. and I was fucked up out of my mind. Everything gradually went back to normal after that. 



It was a great experience but unfortunate that I couldn't remember a lot of it. I had taken about 15 mg of Adderall Fri. morning\ldots .Effect it or not? I'll never know.
