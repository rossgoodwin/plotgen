I'm 20 years of age and have been experimenting with drugs for about 4 years now. I have experience with a wide range of substances but tend to lean towards psychodelics most of the time. I had tried 2C-B on two occasions before this and DMT 4 times but I have not had a full breakthrough DMT trip. I have lots of experience with Nitrous.



So, anyway, my main objective of the evening was to have a proper 2C-B trip, my previous two had been unsatisfactory, I wasn't sure whether this was down to low doses or because I also took a fair amount of MDMA on both occasions. I had purchased five 15mg wraps with the intention of doing 22.5mg with a 7.5mg top up for later. I gave my friend N one and put the remaining two away for a later date. Me and N had had a very enjoyable day having been to a flashmob water fight in our local park, spirits high, we took our doses around 6pm then went to the park to play frisbee and wait for the first effects. At around 7pm I realised my attention was being drawn to a strangely coloured tree, It's beginning.



T, a friend we played frisbee with but who was not indulging in any 2C-B, had to leave so me and N walked back to my house with him and decided to sit, have a spliff and listen to some tunes while we came up. The two hours was possibly the best come up I have experienced, so intense, the whole room was spinning, morphing and breathing with the music. Sometimes things would seem uneasy but there was a constant feeling of absolute euphoria which totally made up for any paranoid thoughts. During this period we listened to a few CD's, I felt such a connection to the music, one song in particular by Squarepusher, its 15mins long but could of been an hour. During the song it felt less like I was listening to the music more like the music was making love to me. I explained this to N who found it quite funny.



It was at this point we decided to leave the house again to try and find another friend who had also taken 2C-B elsewhere. I steppped out of my front door and for a few seconds could not remember which way I needed to walk. It was at this point that I realised that I was far more under the influence than N was, I exclaimed this and he just laughed and said `I've known that for a while'. I won't go into detail as to what happened on our journey, we ended up sat around a fire while my 2C-B was starting to tail off, I wanted to go home to listen to music and be comfortable, N wanted to stay so I decided that I was ok to walk home on my own.



I got home, this is where it starts to get good. Over the course of the night I had decided that 2C-B is maybe my favourite chemical I've tried so far and I definately wanted to do the remaining 7.5 mg. This was roughly 5 hours after the original dose. I decided to insuflate it, I knew it was going to hurt but it hurt more than anything I have ever snorted before (and this includes around 3/4 gram of yopo seed snuff). My left eye was streaming like a waterfall down my face, my nasal cavity was on fire and I was instantly tripping even harder than I had been at the peak. I decided to try to roll a spliff and just watched in amazment as I put tobacco into a rizla and it just seemed to dissapear into thin air. As I was struggling with the spliff, getting a familiar feeling I get with mushrooms, feeling less like I am in real control of my body, more like I am the man in the cabin at the top of a crane. It was at this point I started to perceive a new dimension, everything in the room was in this dimension and the dimension filled the whole room. It was like a multicoloured cosmic soup that everything was floating in. I would see bits of objects float into this soup the flow back out again. Bright neon lights would start shining from anywhere my attention was not focussed, and I could sense energy rushing everywhere and occasionally presences to my left and right, they seemed to be checking up on me.



DMT started to speak to me. As I mentioned above, I have not had a breakthrough DMT experience yet so I though maybe 2C-B could give me a `leg-up', having read one report of 2C-B + DMT, it sounded quite promising. At first I tried to smoke some, easier said than done when heavily intoxicated, I failed to get a good hit at all. I waited a short amount of time before I decided to insuflate a small amount, roughly 40 - 50mg. Unfortunately, I didn't break through this time either, I did however have some amazing visions and thoughts mainly centered around my lampshade in the front room! I was thinking of it like a living thing, it seemed very fetal to me, glowing red suspended by its life (electricity!) giving cord. Now was the time to do the only nitrous canister left in the house. We bought 1000 about 6 months ago for a party, I had put a couple away for a special occasion, this was the last one and now was the time.



This is where it gets strange, the most strange experience of my life in fact. I cracked the canister, took I couple of steadying breaths, exhaled, then inhaled the balloon 4 or 5 times. I started to think about a story I read about a guy that took salvia then committed suicide because he saw life as pointless afterwords. I soon as I thought about this I'd figured it all out. Everything seemed to have slowed down so much that the universe was revealed to be a series of pendulum hammer style things with  H shaped ends. I coined the term `thunks' for these at time due to the noise they made. With each change of the universe a new unique thunk would swing down and interlock with the other thunks. It seemed to make so much sense at the time I even started to think, `well what about\ldots ' and before I could finish thinking about the question there was another thunk swinging down to explain it right away. 



I start to gel back into the real world slightly, when I do I start the think about the thunks again and I'm transported right back to thunk land. At this point I'm convinced I'm on salvia then I realise I'm clutching a whipped cream dispenser and I think `surely not'. I sit there in awe for about half an hour trying to make some sense of what happened, then the doorbell goes, I reluctantly answer, luckily its only N, he's totally straight now, he rolls a spliff which I appreciate and I babble and try to explain what just happened, not doing very well. We both decided to call it a night after the spliff. 



I had a little trouble sleeping (not suprising!), finally nodded off about 3am. Been up since 9am this morning to cheer my dad on in a half marathon. I feel absolutely fine, slightly spaced out but nothing major. I'm looking forward immensely to taking the remaining 30mg at Glade Festival, see you there all you beautiful people!
