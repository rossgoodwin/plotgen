I began this experiment with little foresight, and I paid the price.  I began the evening with several drinks.  I had A LOT of gin, more than I should've.  I was most drunk.  I said, `Hey, let's test the sacrament again!'  Ok..  Never attempted the nasal route, sounds easy enough.  100 mg DPT HCl salt in two quick shots.  Oh dear.  I can't see.. gotta puke. 



Seems too strong; I lay down on the floor, face down.  Now I'm gone, totally.  I had no concept that I was a person anymore.  I thought that I was some form of insect life, and I only say this after analyzing it later.  It was like I was a fly that was looking for some slime on the floor to eat.  There were other creatures like myself around me, and they kinda showed me what to eat.  I remember thinking `oh yeah, we need this stuff'.  I was like a new born child in a new body, and I had to re-learn everything in this reality.  My mind tried to retrieve my ego and I thought, `no, I'm insane now.  This is Art.'  



I knew that I was not all right, but I also thought that there was no other way to be, and that if I was indeed insane, then that was it.  I had no memory of taking any sacramental supplement, nor any memory of my life up until that point.  I was comfortable being insane (there was no other way), I realized that there was no way I could ever communicate with another being again, except for these other insect creatures. 

 

Suddenly, I was beyond my insect form, and I feared that I were dead.  It was not a scarry feeling, just one of total loss.  This is where it got really intense.  I was in a void of space, where other bodyless beings were swirling around madly.  We all had one purpose, to get `THE THING'.  It was something that always avoided capture, like a point of light just out of reach.  We all screamed and moaned and ripped eachother's forms apart in an insane fit to GET THE THING.  Time seemed to stretch to infinity.  Of course we could NEVER get it, and I realized that this was NEVER going to end, and that I was damned to spend eternity trying to GET THE THING.  I said `Let us make up some GAMES, so we may forget about the thing!'  Everyone else said NO!! WE MUST HAVE IT!!!  and we went back to our PAINful torment which seemed to last FOREVER..    



Then it changed again and I was being spoken to by some oriental master.  He spoke his language which sounded tibetan or something like that.  I understood the meaning, but now that I think about the words he used (I can still hear them perfectly), I can't put it all back together again.  He was telling me there was a great joyous occasion taking place, and I felt what he said.  Many entities were preparing for this `joyous occasion'.  He showed me how to do this strange chant, which I can't really put into words enough to type.  He put all this emotion/energy/compasion into the chant, like he was showing me how to feel.  It was MOST INTENSE.  I think I was crying in the vision ( I don't know WHAT my face down in the floor body was doing, probably slobering everywhere).  



Then it changed AGAIN.. I was a pitiful beggar.  I was crawling around in the dirt chanting AUM MANI PADME HUM.  But it was as if those where the only words I COULD say.  They had to mean EVERYTHING.  Like `DUDE' can mean every word, depending on inflection.  I would change the inflection of the mantra and it would take on new meanings each time.  I said it with the most pitiful, horrible, beggar's LOST HOPE voice one could possibly muster up.  I was at ROCK bottom.  I had NOTHING, not even death!  All I could do was BEG for ANYTHING.  And my begging was the mantra.  

Suddenly, I was wisked away again, this time by benevolent spirits of Spring.  They showed me green parks and flowers and filled my spirit with the joy and desire to `Get out there and give it your ALL!'.  They actually said that to me, with a smile and a laugh.  They made me so happy and like I was one of them, I belonged with these beautiful spirits of spring and youth.  We flew about quickly through the green lands.  I was compelled to open my real eyes.  My friend was face down on the floor next to me, and the room was swirling around like a TOOL video.  We both got up and were able to speak a few minutes later.  He had not seen such visions as I had, but was still most impressed.  We were back to a reasonable baseline within 3h from launch.



I still cannot stop thinking about those visions.  I feel changed, like I died and don't know what to do now.  I feel like this `life' is the `game' I wanted to play to forget about THE THING.  I hear the oriental master's words ALL DAY, but I don't remember what they meant, it's all just `a feeling'.  Overall,  too much, but very intense.  I still feel like my body is out of whack physically and mentally.  The Chiropractor took one look at me and said `What in the world happened to you?'  He said there were several obvious signs of major stress in my system.  



I would NOT recommend alcohol and these drugs.  Alcohol is not an MAO inhibitor, but it also can greatly affect the intensity of most other drugs.  This was a dangerous thing to do, and I would NEVER repeat such an experiment.  The ABSOLUTE safest way to take DPT is ORALLY or RECTALLY.  If combined with syrian rue seeds, the oral route is very nice, but lasts quite a while.



SNORTING DPT IS TOO DANGEROUS!  Don't do it.  Too many people have serious MEDICAL issues.  How would you feel if you dosed your friend and he ended up in the hospital.  It happens A LOT.  100 mg rectally, with a baby medical syringe is by far the best way to do this.   



Peace.



Marz
