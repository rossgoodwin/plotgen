Before I begin to talk about the actual cocaine experience it is important that I go over a few details of my life that have affected the way I view Cocaine. The main fact that I would like to bring up is that both my father and sister have become addicted to this drug.



The second fact that I would like to bring up is that since I was a little kid I have sworn to myself that I would never do Cocaine because of what I have seen it do to people.



The third fact that greatly affects my opinion of this drug is that, I have heard people rant and rave about cocaine being the best thing around and how it is better than sex. The only drug that I have ever had that was better than sex was MDMA and it was hard to imagine something different from MDMA yet better than sex.



Now for some minor background information on the day of the experience. I had just gotten off work with the intent to pick up some money that my ex-girlfriend owed me and then head to a party/BBQ at a friends house. I told the guy that was throwing the party that I would be there around 7 p.m., so I needed to hurry as I had just gotten off work at 6 p.m. I arrived at my ex's house and she proceeded to act apologetic for cheating on me and telling me it was a mistake.



She kept me going until 8:30 p.m. telling me she loved me and other bogus stuff. This made me mad and I arrived at the party not only late, but in foul spirits as well. I drank a bit and talked to my friend and apparently most of everyone was leaving to go to a show. I noticed people where chopping up cocaine on a nearby table and asked them about it, seeing as how it is one of the few drugs I haven't done.



They didn't really have the answers I wanted so I asked my friend what he thought; he said it was nothing spectacular. One of his friends overheard us and asked me if I wanted to try it. I didn't even think before saying yes, I felt if I'm supposed to put up with other peoples lapses in morality then I can at least have one of my own.



The guy cut up a couple large lines of coke and we each did one. I was drunk before doing this and immediately I felt sober. In fact I felt more sober than ever, not high: just really normal. There was a certain energy about it but not the jittery feeling one gets on Crystal Meth or Ephedra. My muscles felt relaxed and I felt more sociable and talkative. This was not the extreme sociability of MDMA, where you can't stop talking, but rather just a feeling that talking is easier. I started up conversations with people I normally wouldn't have but didn't feel like I could open up to them or that they were instantaneously friendly.



Bodily pain disappeared but again it was unlike the MDMA, where pain becomes pleasure, feeling. Instead of pleasure I just felt lack of pain. The bodily feeling were, contrary to what everyone says, not even close to as good as sex. Maybe I just have better sex than everyone but I just felt happy/sober not the wasted with pleasure feeling of sex or MDMA. Unlike other drugs, there was very little effect on my perception of time.

The only real uses I see for this drug is as an anesthetic (which is what it is used for in medicine) or to sober up really quick, maybe as a motivation enhancer too.



As an energy drug, Crystal Meth and Ephedra are stronger but cocaine is less obvious. I would draw a close parallel between cocaine and large amounts of caffeine, a stimulated but not intoxicated state. As far as spiritual/magickal uses go; cocaine may be useful as a tool for grounding but that is debatable.



While on Cocaine I tried a couple other common drugs to check for any synergistic effects. Cocaine flat out blocked the effects of alcohol. I didn't feel drunk no matter what I drank. Marijuana adds an interesting aspect to the experience. With this combination you feel more obviously fucked up with memory impairment and lack of coordination. However you still feel motivated and the talkative aspect of the cocaine is enhanced. This combination is somewhat similar to the Crystal Meth, jittery fucked up stimulation, feeling. It also takes a lot more Pot to effect you when you are on Cocaine and you come down a lot quicker.



Other bad things about Coke include a hangover the next day, insomnia, and it's cost. While the hangover from coke is not horrible it is still obvious and annoying. I feel dizzy, mildly nauseous and I have a headache. Also, if you enjoy being able to fall asleep whenever you want then this is not the drug for you.



Finally, cocaine costs way too much and doesn't last long enough (three hours at the most). 



The basic result of this experience was that I learned that Cocaine is not as good as people say. I don't think I will ever do it again because there are so many better drugs out there and many of them are legal. I also find the fact that it blocks the effects of other drugs to be annoying and highly limiting to its use as a tool for exploration. Even as a `stay awake drug' it is limiting because it costs too much to be useful. One could pay fifty cents for enough Ephedra to cause the same stimulation as fifty dollars worth of cocaine. I really don't think it is worth it.
