Background info: I am 17 and I live and go to school in Canberra, Australia.



I have done a fair bit of marijuana in the past (haven't we all) and I have done Ketamine twice before - the first time was awesome, the second time REALLY SUCKED.



I did DXM for the first time about a week ago. The following is a report of today's experience - my second time on DXM. I hope what I have written may be of some small use or interest to someone out there.



Today (Thursday) was a day off school for me, so I decided to try DXM for the second time. My first DXM trip was a week before on a moderate first plateau dose, and I decided it was great fun\ldots  I was staggering around like a drunken fool and having the time of my life. It was like being drunk and stoned without all the crappy side effects, but with a whole lot of other weird side effects (especially the visual ones\ldots . mmmmm).



So, today I was looking forward to some more fun getting high off cough medicine, but I also wished to explore the mystical nature of DXM further\ldots  and the experience was not disappointing by any measure.



It starts. I slept in until at about 11am, because I had smoked some marijuana the night before. I got up and dressed and did some work around the house, and at about 11:30 I retreated to my room to do the deed (on an empty stomach). I poured out about 55mL of `Robitussin DX' in one of those little plastic `shot glasses' and sucked it down\ldots . then another 55mL, and I washed it all down with some water. (Note: this was 3mg/mL syrup - so I probably had about 330 mg DXM.) The taste wasn't too bad, but drinking half a bottle of it was hard work. Maybe next time some marijuana will help.



I decided to try and finish as much housework as possible before the trip started, so I was sorting out some clothes to wash, and hanging clothes out on the line and I was getting a bit paranoid\ldots  but I got enough stuff done in time.



About 20 minutes after I drank the syrup, it started to hit me.



The first noticeable thing about the high was the visual distortion and loss of bodily co-ordination (this was familiar to me from last week's trip). So I was experiencing the first fun effects of DXM\ldots  I think I just wandered around the house and outside a bit, maybe I was lying down too. Sometimes I felt like I was a bit taller than usual, or things were closer than usual\ldots  like I would be in the bathroom and I reached for a towel and it was right in front of me in my hands. That was a cool thing. Then I decided to have a bowl of cereal, because I hadn't eaten anything since I woke up. BAD IDEA!!! I started eating it, and by now I was moderately high - I couldn't walk properly and I had that `choppy' vision. I had almost finished the cereal, but the taste started to get really disgusting, so I stopped eating it and walked like a zombie to the bathroom. I lifted the toilet seat up and spewed up all the Robitussin I had drunk in the morning. DAMN!!! That was 10 dollars worth of cough syrup (Robitussin is \$20 a bottle in Australia), and I had lost the chance to experience its effects. Or so I thought\ldots .



By the time I threw up in the toilet (about 12:50) I was well and truly tripping. I wandered around for about 15 minutes (I think I went to my room to lie down) and a bit after 1:00 I went out into the garden and spewed up again. DAMN!!! It must have been the fact that I drank the syrup on an empty stomach, I think that is why I threw up. Or maybe I just had too much\ldots . after all, I had only done a small dose of DXM once before. I might just mention this\ldots  the first time I did DXM, I became quite itchy - on my arms and hands especially. This time there was no itching - strange. Anyway I went to lie down on my bed. This is probably where my trip peaked, maybe for about an hour from 1:00 to 2:00.



I had just thrown up in the garden and I was lying on my bed. This is where the weirdest part of the trip occured. I closed my eyes for a while, I think I might have fallen asleep for a little while. I was watching the visual effects, which were not very strong, with my eyes closed. Then I was in a state which is impossible to describe properly\ldots  I was awake, but because I had my eyes closed, I was not using my body to move around and do stuff. It was more like I was just sitting inside a dark container (my body). But the mind is a whole different world, and I was exploring it a little bit. Exploring the mind is like going to a completely different place where nothing seems to make sense, where I see all these random and flowing images that don't seem to fit together (unlike the images of our world, which all seem to fit together perfectly). I was sitting in the dark cave of my mind for a little while, just watching the images flow past, one after another. I am relatively mature in this Earth-world, but if I go into this mind-world, I am like a newborn child who does not understand anything about what he sees everywhere. I wanted to learn a bit more about my mind\ldots  after all, how do people learn to use psychic powers? How did people become magicians and sorcerors in the old days? It is just exploring one's own mind. 



This previous paragraph may seem really weird to you - I think this is one aspect of the `mystical' or `shamanic' side of DXM. People sees different hallucinations on drugs, and you can't understand it just by hearing someone else talk about it\ldots  It is like talking about things I see in dreams - I think it kind of destroys the experience when I tell someone else.



So I was lying on my bed and watching the closed-eye visuals for maybe 45 minutes. I scribbled some points onto a notepad nearby. 



`Boredom relief.' This is true.. I could spend time just sitting or lying down and not get bored at all. `Vivid CEVs.' I had some very nice closed-eye visual effects at this point. There is no real point in trying to describe them, because they were so weird, there were so many different images, and I have forgotten most of them now anyway. There were many nice fluid shapes that I saw and images that I noticed.



`Double vision.' My vision was really strange during the peak of the trip. It was serious double vision, like when I am nicely drunk - no doubt about it. Excellent.



I also wrote the phrase `Tapping into the Mainframe' as a description of the trip's peak, so I have used it as the title of this report too. I am not even going to try to explain what `Tapping into the Mainframe' might mean\ldots  something significant no doubt. The trouble is, I have forgotten much of the really deep parts of the experience. At some point I wrote `you learn secrets that you later forget.' Later on the computer I also wrote `I was lying on my bed not wanting to get up\ldots  you can kind of close your eyes and forget your body\ldots  and just explore the things you see in your mind.'



After my whole `mystical journey' into my mind, I went off to use the computer. I was enjoying the effects at this time\ldots  like my previous DXM trip, I was in a much more euphoric mood than usual. There is only one word I found to properly describe the feeling: FUN!!! Everything is just so much FUN. My friends were online on MSN messenger - I think I scared them a bit with what I was saying! Here are some examples of the stuff I wrote:



`Really trippy and awezome\ldots  it is so much fun man\ldots .'

`I will make some wierd mistzkes\ldots  I am typing real funny hahahahahh'



`Wow this is so awesome\ldots  man u guys gotta see me today'

`My pupils are like massive'

(My pupils were maybe 50\% dilated\ldots . I thought it was so cool hahahah)



`when I was on my bed it was AWESOME!!!!!'

`wow this is so much FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!'

`\ldots and it is a really beautiful trip'



So you can see I was enjoying my time on the computer talking with my friends. Excellent. I was fucked out of my mind at this point\ldots  I couldn't even type properly, but I could hardly complain about the EUPHORIA. I listened to the same mp3, over and over again (the song was `Dumb' by Nirvana). I looked up `astronomy' and saw a picture of a `high-resolution map of microwave light emitted only 380,000 years after the Big Bang,' and I thought it was cool. I laughed a lot. This was what I enjoyed about last week's First Plateau DXM trip. Spirituality, mysticism and self-exploration may all be very worthwhile uses for drugs, but this was just FUN FUN FUN.



This enjoyable escapade lasted about half an hour. Afterwards I went back to my room and read some of `Brave New World' by Huxley, and the DXM wore off. It was a nice smooth ending to the high.



I can't say much to conclude this, really. I guess my report seems like a typical beginner's amazement at how cool DXM can be. But I will say a few words about what I have decided after this experience.



My first trip was so much fun I could hardly believe it. I don't know if I will do DXM anymore\ldots  but my first experience, and this second one, have been so overwhelmingly positive, that I feel like I have to write something. Today was, as I said to a friend, `a really beautiful trip.'
