It is hard for me to believe there are not more experience report entries for Sally D. and nitrous taken in quick succession!!!



My first experience smoking Salvia Divinorum was a little anticlimactic. I had read many earth-shattering experience reports leading up to getting some Sally extracts delivered to me via an internet vendor. The day came that I came home from work, checked the mail, and did a little dance when I saw my Salvia sitting there in my mailbox.



Let's back up a little. Back in the early 1990's, I was a serious head. See, Entheogens turned me from a teenage Atheist into a God-fearing man. I bought, sold, grew, and wildcrafted hallucinogens. At times, if you would have checked my freezer about a decade ago, you would have found the obligatory L.S.D.-25 blotter, along with Cubensis mushrooms, Desmanthus root, a few species of Trichocereus cactus, Peganum, Ipomea, and Rivea seeds, and the odd container of Bufo Alvarius venom. Back then, 500-1000 micrograms of the Eucharist wasn't something to fear.



So I opened the mail and called a good friend. 



I get home from work several hours before Heather, (my sweetie) and I had already talked her into being the sitter for my first experience. Now that I had the Salvia in my sweaty, eager little paws, waiting was not an option. There were samples of 5x, 10x, and 15x Salvia extracts. I called Jeremy and asked him what was going on at his place. Family was there - I didn't want to launch at his place. He said he'd call me back, but I turned off my phone, determined my intentions with this trip, said a little prayer, and began smoking the 5x. 



The Salvia was very obviously active, but I didn't feel like getting up and running away from the effects as many have reported. The doorbell rang: it was Jeremy. He apparently had called back, and was concerned when he repeatedly got sent to voicemail. I answered the door and had no problem communicating with him after smoking several hits of the 5x. He helped himself to a beer and told me to feel free to keep experimenting\ldots ``Smoke some of the stronger stuff. Take a big hit. I can hang out for awhile.'' \ldotsGOOD FRIEND!



I put about a bong load of the 15x into a blown glass pipe, and used a butane torch and held it on the plant material for the duration of the inhalation to light it. I covered my eyes with my palms and watched as darkness segmented into luminescent cells and filaments of color. The interplay of form and color was very psychedelic, but the peak effects lasted only several minutes. I described the effects to my buddy and loaded another hit.



Jeremy noticed a case of nitrous on my coffee table. I told him to knock himself out. After all, the guy came in a hurry when he knew I needed a sitter. So I was smoking and he was gassing. We went up and came down. Then up again and down again. The 15x was definitely stronger, but I still felt comfortable with my buddy there and all. I told him that Salvia was definitely a real hallucinogen, but I didn't understand how people tended to freak out on it. Sure, the transition is quick, but it is not that bad. Jeremy had another beer, we shot the shit for a while, and he took off. I came down some more, and when I was pretty much back to baseline consciousness, I decided to hit the 5x a few times and do a nitrous charger. That's when it got interesting.



Effects of Salvia Divinorum Extract and Nitrous Oxide



Sitting on the floor in front of my couch, I took three solid hits of the 5x in quick succession using high heat, and cracked a nitrous oxide charger. Before I had exhaled the last hit of Salvia, I was reclining on the couch with a nitrous balloon at the ready. I exhaled the Salvia, took a breath, blew it out, and took in the gas. I covered my eyes with a pillow, and was gone.



The visions started with diamonds. Day-Glo diamond shaped segments rolled out of the darkness on my visual screen. The objects quickly formed an orb or dome around me, and it seemed as if I was staring up to a nexus where the diamonds spiraled outward. I was no longer laying on my couch in my front room. Each diamond had an ``s'' shaped double spiral design inscribed inside, and every element of the whole design was quickly changing from color to color. Bolts of energy shot up around me, finding their way between the diamonds, up toward the nexus. There was music that emanated from everywhere, and in the brief intervals between notes, it was if I could tell what notes were to come next. I felt very closely cut off from my own singular selfness, very near ego loss. I felt like a child. I was born into a new truth.



There were implied voices\ldotslike I could hear other entities thinking,\ldotsthe music I heard was real, like I was actually hearing it with my ears, but the voices were more like the thoughts of others that I happened to be privy to. The first thoughts were to the effect that I was ``finally here.'' They were welcoming me. ``He is here!'', they thought, followed by a singular, more authoritative voice. It didn't feel like the voice of God - more like an angel that was in charge of consciousness. It said something that meant both ``This is where your mind came from'' and ``This is where all consciousness comes from'' at the same time. I was filled with awe. It seemed as if my mind was a drop of rain, and I was being shown the ocean from which I originated.



Well, that's it, kids. 



I was disconnected from my body throughout this experience, but as soon as I blew out the nitrous gas and started breathing air, I fell back into myself and regained my bearings. There were very little or no body effects in subsequent experiments\ldotsnothing that felt toxic at all. Since then, I have firmly felt that Salvia is wasted without nitrous, and nitrous is wasted without Salvia. Since then, I have smoked 10x and 15x extracts followed quickly by nitrous, and have done fine.
