 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# 



(Around 5:30pm on Saturday)T+ 0:00- I take 20 pills[1000mg] over the process of 5 minutes.



T+ 1:00- I began to notice the effects, my body is starting to feel hollow. When I stood up I had a huge head rush and was dizzy, I couldn't keep standing. 



T+ 1:30- I'm watching that 70s show in my basement, I start to notice lights flickering all over. The trippy backround from `that 70s show cutscenes' kept flashing all over the walls, it was basicly reflected from the TV, but nothing else was, just the cool colours. 



T+ 1:45- My motor skills were so messed up. I was stumbling all over when I tryed to stand up, I ran into about 5 things just getting to the stairs. I eventually got up to my room without my parents coming by (they were eating dinner on the deck in our backyard). By the time I was up to my room and the body high was really kicking in.



T+ 2:00- I took the other 30 pills[1500mg] from the bottle of 50. That made a total of 2500mg. 



T+ 2:30- I was in my room playing halo on XBL when the distortions started to come in. This was what I was hoping for with taking a big dose, my favourite part of DPH [started from blue diamond E pills] was visual distortions. My TV was cutting out and re-appearing constantly, I had to stop playing, I couldn't keep track.



T+ 3:00- I got back on my computer to read some trip reports while my peak was certainly coming, I kept getting muscle spasms so I couldn't type much. Reading seemed like a good idea. 



*This is about the time I lost sense of time. I still remember exactly the next point but after the movie everything is hazy. I remember the general order of events, though it seems wrong for some reason. I remember the times by basing it the movie and how many times I went downstairs, but its still really weird. I'll do my best to get the times to the general area.*



T+ 3:30- After reading lots of experiences with DPH I realised I had taken alot more then the average dose. I was worried about dieing as much, I knew the ld50 was much higher [though people have had weird overdoses and body damaging things with low doses]. As I was reading my screen words started to morph and melt together. I figured this was a waste of time so I put Dazed and Confused in the drive and layed down on my bd.



T+ 4:00- It was past 9 now because it had been at least 3+ hours since I popped the first 20. So I had known my parents were in bed, I felt I could relax and watch the movie. By now the body high was intense and annoying, I couldn't sit still and felt a bit speedy. So I decided to do sit ups while watching, as I was doing them I suddenly hit my head on a bar. I figured pain was taken away from the DPH so it was fine.



T+ 4:15- Sit ups were boring me, so I decided to do pull ups on the bar. I had realised the bar couldn't be much higher then my bed if I hit my head on it. But, wait a second, there's no bar in my room. I went to turn on the lights so I could see the bar, but ended up in my bathroom by the toilet. I still don't know what happened, it was a weird memory lapse, but the lights were still off so I must not have got that done. I was starting to freak out a little, I hadn't known DPH to do something like this. So I went back to lie in my bed and watch the movie.



T+ 4:30- I was getting a drink of water on the main floor of my house, poored myself a glass and was drinking it there. Suddenly the glass was gone and I was holding two peices of paper, my mom came downstairs and asked what the hell I was doing. I said I had to staple my project together for school tommmorow [it's Saturday night, no I don't have school on Sundays].



T+ 4:35- We just stood there staring at each other for a few minutes. Then she told me to go to bed and that I didn't have school tommorow, so I stumbled my way upstairs. Now I was scared that my mom had caught me being high on something other then weed, I'd been caught for that many times.



T+ 4:45- Being worried about being caught I started to think about hallucinations. As soon as I was thinking if what really happened, had happened. I got a sudden urge to go to school to hand in that project. Every time I thought about hallucinations or the fact that I was high, it came back too those peices of paper for the project. So I got my bag and went downstairs to get some water then go to school.



T+ 5:00- This time I opened my house door and the alarm went off. My parents rushed downstairs asking what I was doing and at this time of night. I was so sure my friend Gabe was standing right outside to go to school, and that my project would be overdue if I didn't go. My parents asked what project and I told them the one I was trying to staple less then an hour ago, my parents said I hadn't left my room all night and that they were in bed reading.



T+ 5:10- After a confusing conversation with my parents, telling them I wasn't `smoking the herb' [I had forgotten I even popped the  50 pills] I appeared in my room. I figured I'd finish the movie then go to sleep. I went to press play on the movie, and my monitor disappeared. Now I remembered I was high, and wondered if all that stuff really happened.



T+ 6:00- The movie was over a few minutes ago, I had enjoyed tripping out to the monitor distorting and colours randomly changing in the corner of my eye. The body high from the DPH was now gone, and I thought it was bassicly over, maybe some after effects. I went downstairs to at least find the stapler for my project. My entire trip seemed to revolve around me stapling these peices of paper, for a project that doesn't exist. All my DPH trips seem to be linked to one thing I must get done. When downstairs I talked to my dad about how good coffee tasted and how he should start selling it on ebay for extra money. 



T+ 6:30- My mom came downstairs yelling at me for being up so late and for making coffee in the middle of the night. Somehow now I was holding a glass of water which she was telling me was coffee. I kept saying how it was water, and poured some on the ground to prove it [doesn't make sense, but at that time it did]. When I had looked up to tell her it was water, she was gone. Remembering now vividly that I was high and had taken a great dose, I was back in my room [these weird memory lapses happened alot].



T+ 7:00- I now could remember my whole night, I was freaked out about being caught and worried about what had happened. I felt sleep would fix everything, So I went to bed. 



*The times above are general times to how I think everything was spaced out. But it would seem that it was at least 2am or so by this time, not 12:30 [5:30+7:00.) The below times are all general for when I woke up while sleeping.*



T+ 7:30- I woke up to see my three friends sitting in my room playing halo and smoking a joint. So I told them to pack a bowl in my pipe, they packed it. They said I could have first hit and put it on the floor for me to grab, as I kept grabbing for it, it would disappear. I really wanted to smoke, so I was anoyed and kept reaching faster and faster. So pissed off, I lied back in my bed.



T+ 7:30+X:XX- Later that night I woke up and my friends were still there. My friend Sam came up to me and handed me my pipe, saying this time it wouldn't disappear. At this time I thought about how he could know that. I asked him how he knew it was disappearing. Then they were all gone, so I decided the must have left and left me a bowl. I thought I'd sleep a bit then have it.



T+ 7:30+Y:YY- I woke up again to smoke this bowl. Again as I reached for my pipe it would disappear, then this time it didn't come back again. I couldn't believe it. I was so sad, my pipe was gone and I couldn't find it. I searched my entire room for along time and couldn't find it, I was so pissed off. Then my mom barged through the door, picked up my pipe and yelled at my for smoking weed again. She told me to go to sleep and we'd talk about it in the morning.



(8am Sunday morning)T+ 14:30- I went downstairs, not remembering the night at all. I told my parents I'd grab some coffee and go to school. They kept telling me I didn't have school and it was Sunday morning. Then my mom talked to me about me being outside in the middle of the night [as soon as she said that my whole trip flashed back into my head, I remembered so much]. She said she figured I was sleepwalking when I was outside, and said if it happens again we'd see a doctor. I asked her about the other times that night I saw her, she didn't know what I was talking about. Now it was Sunday morning, my hallucinations were over, and I wasn't in any trouble. For the rest of that day I had a huge headache and the time of day kept messing me up, I thought it was dinner at 2pm, kept saying I had to go to school, stuff like that.



AFTER NOTES:

Well talking to my parents about `me sleepwalking' helped me find out what hallucinations really happened. Apparently my friends had never come over, my parents only saw me one time [when I opened the door and set the alarm off]. I did make coffee in the middle of the night somehow, I had the empty packet of beans and my mug in my room. DPH was a really scary drug, but scary in a good way. That night was the most intense high ever, not knowing what was happening, the memory lapses, and the body high was pretty enjoyable except for the fact I was restless and felt strained. This wasn't my first time with DPH, but I had only taken 700mg or less before, which caused a ok body high, with distortions and colour changing, those kind of visuals.
