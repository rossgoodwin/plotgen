This weekend, I had an utterly unreal experience while combining ecstasy and cannabis. I first got the idea to combine the drugs a couple of months ago, the last time I took E. I usually smoke a little weed while coming down. Last time, I smoked a small amount of marijuana about a half an hour before the comedown and noticed a very synergistic effect. So this time I decided to smoke a lot while the E was still in full effect. Below is a summary of what I experienced.



11:00 PM - I took the E while driving around with my friend Matt, looking for a place to smoke. I knew the E was legit since my friend Chris, an experienced roller, had taken a pill from the same batch the night before and reported it to be awesome.



11:15 PM - Already feeling the E. I took out my cell phone to see if I could find a place to stay for the night, since my parents can tell in a second when I'm high or hungover. I was almost blinded by the brightness of the screen. I looked up and noticed all the lights were especially brilliant and realized I was already starting to roll.



11:25 PM - We're driving through Matt's neighborhood (it's pretty   much deserted at this time of night, even on a Friday). He sees a couple of his friends walking down the street and stops to talk to them. He stops for maybe five minutes and I'm growing incredibly restless waiting for him to get going again. He asks if they want to smoke with us, but they decline and we continue on our way.



11:35 PM - We stop at a park and Matt breaks out a gram of weed from his personal stash. It's called Sensei Star or something and is supposedly very high quality. He rolls the blunt. It's quite obvious now that I'm rolling as I'm feeling very upbeat and can't seem to shut up.



11:40 PM - We split the blunt between the two of us. Before we're even finished, I realize this is going to be an insanely powerful high. I almost have to pass up the last couple of hits, but I take them anyway. I'm so high, I can barely move.



11:50 PM - We're driving around again. Matt wants to find a party. At this point, we see his two friends we saw earlier and stop to talk to them. They start laughing their asses off. One of them says, `You guys are fuckin' gone! Just go home and go to sleep.' Seems like a good idea to me, so I encourage Matt to do so.



12:00 AM - Matt realizes there's no way I'm faking it if my parents are still awake, so he sneaks me into his house. His brother's there and is very amused by how high we are. Max stays downstairs and talks to his brother and grabs some pizza. All I can do is stumble to his room and collapse on his bed.



12:05 AM - Now that I'm alone and can concentrate on the high, it gets really interesting. I just read another report that says that the combination of E and cannabis felt like shrooming, and this is definitely what I think, too. The body high from the E is gone. I can barely move and have no energy at all, but my mind is still racing at a mile a minute and any paranoia from the weed is quickly fended off by the euphoria of the E. I'm having the kind of divine thoughts I have on shrooms. I feel like the drugs are revealing all of life's secrets to me. I decide that the way to true enlightenment is complete freedom from desire and worry (Buddha, anyone?). I can't even explain the full scope of my thoughts in this report, but I can tell you that they're definitely very religious in nature (strange, because I'm not religious AT ALL). Considering this, and considering that I have these same thoughts when I'm on shrooms, I'm convinced the majority of religion is based off of psychedelic experiences. Anyway, these are definitely `shrooming' thoughts that I'm having.



12:05 AM still - In addition to the incredibly deep mental high, I'm noticing that the music Matt has playing in his room sounds incredible. I love music, and listening to it while I'm high is one of my favorite things to do, but this is different. I can't even tell what genre it is, probably rap, since that's what Matt usually listens to, because I'm listening to each note individually. Every note sounds so full and rich, and I feel like I'm being lifted away to another dimension with each one. I don't remember what the words were saying, but I remember thinking that they spoke directly to me. Considering that this was probably some shallow rap album about guns and sex, I absolutely cannot wait to repeat this experience with some Pink Floyd or Jefferson Airplane to listen to.



1:45 AM - Matt's asleep now. I check the time on my cell phone and I'm still feeling the full effects of the high.



I drifted to sleep shortly after that. I woke up at 9 AM feeling great. Unbelievable since E usually ruins me for a day or two afterward, as I have no energy and nothing but the most negative thoughts. This is nowhere to be found this time. I'm upbeat and energetic. I don't mean wired and jittery, but like I'm actually ready to do stuff. Matt has to go to work, so he drops me off at my house around 9:30 AM. Of course, my mom's waiting for me asking what was wrong with me and what drugs I'd done. She asks this pretty much everytime I walk in the door nowadays. Surprisingly, I'm able to play cool and convince her I'm fine. I check the mirror and notice that my pupils are normal sized. Another surprise, since my eyes usually look hellacious the day after an E high. The happiness and energy lasted pretty much all day. Unbelievable. No hangover whatsoever, and actually, an afterglow. I didn't even nap at all during the day.



This was honestly one of the best highs of my life. I can't wait to repeat this experience, and I highly recommend trying this at least once. Just make sure you have a place to just lay down in peace, as it really wasn't a social high.
