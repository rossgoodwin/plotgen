 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\#    



I finally feel as though I have a report worth really writing up. Not that other trials and experiments where less important or not as good as this one. But last night was a good example of what happens when even the most cautious of researchers gets complacent.



Let me set the stage a little. I had only had 4 hours of sleep the night before because I had a probation meeting the next day. It was possible I would fail as I had been smoking a LOT of medical grade corn (marijuana as its known) everyday for 3 months. I had tested myself days before and was positive. Even though Ive been on probation for over a year now and never failed, I just had a bad feeling. This disturbed my sleep and I was tired the next day. 



I ended up just calling my PO and telling her I had bronchitis. Which isn't a lie, I still have severe bronchitis right this very moment. She lets me reschedule for a week later and two weeks worth of stress floats away. My day goes well and I am in an excellent mood.



I drop my girlfriend off at around 10:30pm and waited until around 11pm to head over to my tripping buddies (alias: C) house. When I get there hes got a 24 pack of Natty Ice and some `herbal incense' (it wasnt JWH-018 I know that much). We toked a doobie of this incense and cracked a few beers and continued this until around 1am. Another freind (alias: A) came over to hang and was feeling down as he had just broken up with his girlfriend. We tried to cheer him up but his mindset is fucking weird and insecure to begin with. At least we tried. At 1:30am C and I(me) decided to indulge a little more. I had 10mg of really pure 2C-B left, as well as 18mg of equally pure 2C-C. I urged C that we needed to snort it as last time he took 35mg orally and I took 20mg orally. (This was after 6 beers each and both our bellies where full to the brim. It was mild but pleasent.) This time we wanted more. So I thoroughly mixed the 2C's together for a total amount of 28mg.



At 1:35am I insulffated 3mg 2C-B and 5mg 2C-C. I then pressed the powder up against my thumb and rubbed it under my tongue into those big beautiful blood vessels. 2mg 2C-B and 4mg 2C-C orally. I forgot to mention that yes the 2C's hurt like hell to snort. But nowhere near the cranium splitting that 4-EMC causes. Nothing can touch that pain. C also took the same doses the same way at the same time. I chewed up 0.5mg of Etilaam (etizolam) immeadiately after.



We continued drinking beers and smoking `spice' until around 2am when I noticed C's eyes where really dilated. A quick glance in the mirror revealed my eyes where saucers. Huge. All of a sudden it hit me. I was tripping! Not too hard but definately imagery with eyes closed and a really light, relaxing body high. My muscles could relax. I stretched for a few minutes which felt great. I also kept picturing tits. Tits on trains, tits on a jungle gym, tits morphing into other tits. It was great.



C being the monster hardhead that he is wanted more! More of what? The only other psychedelic I had was 5-MeO-MiPT. `Fuck it,' I thought. I measured out 20mg with my milligram scale (0.001g +/- 2mg), (same one for the 2C's I should mention) and dumped it into the `non JWH-018 containing leaf' I mixed them around with a knife as this works extremely well with DMT. 



We smoked it and while there where definate effects besides the `spice,' not really anything overpowering. By this time though (3:30am) C and I(me again) where tripping quite hard on the 2C's. Harder than one might expect. I had had 7 beers by this point and should have been real good and drunk. Intoxicated to say the least. However, I felt surprisingly clear headed. I strive to remember every adventure and usually recall everything with excellent precision. This time was no different. I still remember many details that C doesn't. My freinds love my memory as much as do I.

 

A was not doing enjoying himself because he just didn't know how to vibe with us. It wasn't his fault. We where on another plane, a different level. I could just look at C and know what he was thinking, he could do the same with me. Very intune. I could see how this would be a great love making drug. You just know the other person gets what your thinking. They get it! Its so exciting. A continued to pull off being lame. Tripping over a table and dropping the pipe to the concrete(didnt break all 5 times we dropped it, this greatly pleased us every time) A also kept missing the point of my and C's conversations. He could not keep up with our quick, intense thought processes. He mostly just read theology writings on his phone while C and I talked and giggled.



Eventually A couldn't stand our ramblings anymore and demanded we play Super Smash Bros Brawl. This proved to give C and I extreme pleasure on our last 2C trip. His 1987 50' TV is always truly beautiful when under the influence of a psychedelic though. So we played, it was fun but not as amazing as our last plain ole 2C-C trip. The time was 5am by now and all 24 beers where gone. The trip was getting less intense pretty rapidly. The loved up rush was definately gone. C was passing out over and over, like he usually does. 



A and myself went downstairs to smoke a cigarette (I don't smoke but I did that time) I stupidly wanted to reintensify the trip. And heres where things drastically changed. What happened next was really terrifying. The tobacco probably didn't help as I dont tolerate nicotine well. I loaded 30mg of 5-MeO-MiPT in with a large bowl of blunt tobacco, gross. A watched while I smoked the bowl to complete ash in a few deep lunged hits. He left within 2 minutes of me smoking it. The time was 5:35am when I inhaled. I was alone. I started listening to some great Dub and thats when it happened. 



The `moxy' slowly built up over the next 5-10 minutes to an extremely harsh and toxic feeling body high. Nausea was so bad I almost throw up, and I DONT throw up. My vision was blurred bad. It seemed to kill any lingering 2C visuals and felt like it was killing me. I had strong rushes from arm to arm that hurt. It wasn't like electric feeling, it was just plain pain flying around inside me. I stumbled upstairs to find C sleeping. My anxiety was through the roof. I went in and out of what I call `panic land' repeatedly. The `moxy' came in waves but even at the low points was very terrifying. 



The profound confusion was the worst part. My pulse was over 150bpm. -After many panic attacks and freakouts on MDPV I have come up with a quick little way to accurately gauge it- It was definately over 150bpm. I paced and paced and paced for around 40 minutes and it was still strong. Still terrifying. I felt faint as times. Like my mind was just disapeering and I would die. I kept thinking Id bring all of my consciousnesses with me as I left my body behind to die. This was not pleasent. I have intentionally smoked 400mg of DMT and experienced death, or close to it. This was not like that. There was definately no euphoria. I panicked again and called my girlfriend. She tried to calmed me down, and succeeded slightly.



And then C woke up and I instantly felt better! The `moxy' was still so strong, even an hour after inhaling. It was 6:40am and C was trying to persuade me to eat 200mg of MDAI with him. NO fucking way was I doing that and he soon passed out. I began cleaning his entire basement and his living room. This intensely focused me away from the MiPT and it almost felt good.



I finally laid down at 7:30am to sleep. By this time the 2C's had completely worn off and I was just very drunk and still very disturbed by the MiPT. I would close my eyes as I tryed to drift off to sleep and have thoughts that where not my own. What I mean is these thoughts where things I would never worry about or think of. `I have to go take care or my kids,' and `hope Im not late for church,' are a couple examples that I remember. Not exactly scary thoughts, just not my own. It was alien and surreal. No visuals to speak of, although my vision was still blurred. I called my girlfriend again and told her I thought I might die in my sleep. She assured me I was ok, which did little to soothe the tense anxiety I was still experiencing. Somehow I fell asleep and slept until 1pm the next day, today, the day I'm writing this.



At 1pm, when I awoke I was still foggy brained. Unable to really think clearly and emotionally numb. Irritable. My body ached so badly. I believe my muscles had been very tense the entire time the 5-MeO effects where present. Probably in my sleep as well.



It is now 10:20pm and I am almost done writing this report. Since 1pm I have only smoked a stronger herbal incense and taken 0.25mg of etizolam sublingually (at 10pm). I am still not completely back together. The MiPT really fucked with my head. But I asked for it and knew what could happen. However nothing could have prepared me for pure panic. Panic is panic. My mind today has been stupid. Im not exactly myself. Not much confidence or happyness. C agrees and is totally wiped out.



Overall it was a really great experience. The 2C dose was perfect. So low, but the route ingested made it potent and good. The 5-MeO-MiPT dose was too big and very unpleasent. Ill try it again in awhile. Im not scared. Panic always fades eventually.



These chemicals are very intense and not to be taken for granted. I hope that current legislation does not ban all the 2C's as they are mostly benign, wonderful, life afirming guides. As others have said, please respect these chemicals and they will probably treat you just as nicely in return. I guess 5-MeO-MiPT just has a low tolerance for bullshit. As do I. Id like to apologize to the 5-MeO-MiPT for potentially giving it a bad reputation with this report. It does not deserve any negative thoughts you the reader might have spurred reading this. It was my fault.



I will update this tomorrow after I wake up and eat breakfast. I just realized that pretty much all of this experience happened earlier today, so Im not surprised Im still fog brained. The time is 10:58pm and Im about to take a shower, then off to bed. 



LOVE!
