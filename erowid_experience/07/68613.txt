Hello anonymous reader. My first and only Datura experience happened in early November shortly after Halloween. I previously submitted a report to erowid on this experience, but it was sub-par and written with very little time to reflect on what actually went on during this trip. First of all, let me say that I do not consider myself an experienced `tripper'. In fact, my total drug experiences over two years probably amounts to less than 50. This does not include caffeine or Alcohol. Anyway, even if you are incredibly experienced I do not think you could handle this trip, it is literal insanity. How then, would I find such a substance? Well, as fate has it luck just smiled upon me. I had been reading Carlos Castaneda and was very curious about Datura, the next day I went to school and asked a friend if he knew of any `rare' drugs in the area. He said that `Paul' was giving out `Devil's weed'. In the next 10 minutes I had located `Paul' and indeed, he was giving away seeds of the Datura plant. He gave me around 250 seeds, they were very small and brownish/black.



the next day I took 50 seeds to see if anything would happen. Nothing happened, and I was very disappointed, but I thought perhaps a larger dose would highly increase my chances of a good trip. (Is that possible with Datura? xD). Anyway, I went to bed and thought nothing of it. Two days later I had the opportunity to try out Datura and my friends house who was having a birthday party, there would be me and 6 other people and we had the house largely to ourselves. Very good for being babysat. I arrived with my 200 seeds in a plastic baggy about 6 in the evening, we exchanged greetings and I went inside and we basically chilled for a few. Around 8 everyone had showed up and we walked over to a Variety store to pick up some Energy drinks, I have a very high tolerance to caffeine so I was rather unconcerned about one drink having a huge effect on me in combination with the seeds.



We got back to his house, I drank my energy drink and got the seeds. Twas the moment of truth, after reading many experiences I decided the best method was to make tea and then eat the seeds for good measure anyway. I made the tea, and it does take a long time to really get color (about 10-15 minutes) so give it a few. =P. The tea itself just tasted like hot water. The seeds however tasted like utter crap, except they were a bit spicy. It was an interesting taste, but the texture was very, very horrible. At this point it was nine o'clock and I felt nothing. I was disappointed. I should of known that my town didn't have good drugs, alas; I was wrong. I was coming up and just didn't know it. The come up is very, very long. 3-4 hours I would estimate. Coming up is kind of weird too; you `think' you're getting the Datura effect so you won't talk or you might laugh a bit, it feels very genuine. This is nowhere near to the real trip, I'm not sure if everyone laughs and can't talk when coming up, so this might be attributed to the energy drink.



It's about 10:00, and wow. Can you say holy dry mouth? This is the worst dry mouth I have ever experienced. No question about it, you have to keep water in a glass with you almost constantly to bare it. My friends asked me if I wanted to go for a walk, I declined saying that I was going to sleep instead. This is a mistake. DO NOT GO TO SLEEP, it will fuck up your sense of time even more then what will happen anyway. I'm not sure if I slept or not but I woke up at 12:00, and that was the last time I looked at the clock\ldots dear god\ldots the next thing I knew it felt like I was hit with a rocket of some magical substance, because I started getting trails. I wasn't even aware it was an effect of the Datura! I went upstairs while I still could because it was just starting. I remember Daniel asked me how I was doing, I said `It's just starting man! Just starting!' he kind of laughed, but for me it wasn't really funny. I found it incredibly scary that I was in fact going to have this outlandish experience. I got myself another glass of water (or so I thought, I was later informed I was in fact filling up nothing.) and I went to sit down by Andy Anthony and Gage, who were all playing xbox. All I remember was is that they wanted me to play too, so I did. About 5 minutes after I was playing xbox I looked at my hands because they felt funny. I discovered I wasn't holding anything, I was just twiddling my thumbs as if I was actually playing xbox. From this point on I can not accurately say much, except things got really fucked up.



Every time I went to go to the bathroom I was unable, if anything did come out it was very little. I remember being amused by the ducks in the wall. The only rational thought I had the whole night is I should go down the stairs sitting down so I wouldn't fall, I have no clue how I even managed to remember that I had to be careful because I might fall down. I guess I thought I was normal.  At one point I was downstairs and Anthony wanted to go to sleep. He said `I'm shutting the lights now, you won't be able to see'. My first response was `That's fine, just let me finish my cactus'. He kind of looked at me like I had just said something off the wall (which I did), and he told me again. My second response was `Nah dude, I have good night-eyes'. He shut off the lights anyway, and I went upstairs. The next experience I remember is that my friends stepdad came out of the wall and told me to be quiet because he needed to wake up at 5 in the morning to catch an early octopus. This made perfect sense, and the whole night was spent in fear of waking up someone who wasn't there because they had to catch the early morning octopus. Upstairs some of my friends were still awake, so they accounted some of the stuff that I did to me. I would constantly go to the bathroom, and peak my head around the corner, almost guilty of the fact I was in the bathroom.



Another thing that occurred was I ended up stripping down to my boxers. I have no clue why I did, but I did. They told me to put on some clothes- so I donned my leather jacket. Boxers and a leather jacket must be quite the site. I went into the kitchen a few times, I would pick up batteries that were lying around and drop them for no reason. When asked what I was doing I yelled `It's OK! I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 10 YEARS!!!' A few hours later, it was 7 in the morning and I was still going nuts. They tried to convince me to put my clothes back on, they found my pants in the dog cage and gave them to me. I insisted they were dirty so I tried to wash them in the sink, by hand. They stopped me and told me to put them on- so I did, on my head. They tried to get me to do it again, this time I simply asked them `But what's the average?' My friend responded with `seven' and that answer seemed to suffice.



finally out of the house and being walked home by my two friends, I was feeling normal. Apparently this is farthest from the truth. More than once I would walk onto someones porch and go `It's ok! I know these people! We were playing hide and go seek!' Luckily they got me off most porches before anyone noticed I was there. Another notable thing that happened on the way home was I stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, stared at the ground and said in the most reasonable tone ever: `Oh, it's one of those games. I guess I can play it later then'. When I got home, my dad answered the door\ldots I think the conversation we're about to have confused him more then anything ever could.



My father asked me why I was home early. I said `Oh, I was just getting advil for dylan.' (Dylan was hosting the party). My dad asked why, I responded `Oh. well he has a headache you see.' (I don't remember saying this, I'm going by what my parents told me.) Basically I kept stumbling over myself as to who I was getting advil, it switched between three different people and sometimes I would trail off into nonsense about how girls aren't allowed at parties anyway and I don't know why my dad was worried. He finally asked `You seem pretty spacey I'm surprised you made it home ok'. My response was `Yeah me too, it's a long walk'. Apparently I thought it was best to agree with him in the state I was in.



Needless to say my parents still have no explanation for that time I came home spewing gibberish, they don't know how to detect anything besides drunkness or highness. Either way, I went and slept for 8 hours. I can't really sum it up because I hardly remember it. If you do it- be careful. Be very careful.
