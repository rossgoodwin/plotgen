A week back, I was emotionally and physically bored. I was actually thinking about suicide and how `glossy, gaudy, and fun' it could be. I was reluctantly far away from this, but I kept pondering at it. Anyways, I have been reading up on a few substances, most of which were not tickling my fancy. I am a novice when it comes to psychoactives, only experienced in cannabis, dxm, and nutmeg. Then I ran into Nitrous Oxide. The alluring `sweet taste' of this dissociative air was enough to make me want to try it. I bought the necessities; B12 supplements, balloons, notepads, The Apples in Stereo, etc\ldots and went out to Iowa, where a good friend of mine lives. His place is huge, he's got 50 fucking acres of treeless land.



When I got there, he was out in the midst, cackling about something. We chatted about how our lives have been going, problems in society, and so on till the sunset appeared. We went outside and walked for a bit till we came across a bucket, which contained 6 chargers and a cracker. Enticing, these metal containers were, but my friend, we'll call him pickle, warned me about frostbite from these devils. I got out the balloons and CD player and Pickle started filling up the balloons. For some reason, I had this strange feeling that this was going to be an incredible night.



Pickle gave me the green balloon, and I started to inhale until I had my lungs filled. I immediately tasted that mild sweet flavor. It was a virgin, pure taste that was quite pleasing as I blew out. A couple of seconds passed and I really didn't feel anything. I was playing the wonderful bubblegum tune of Strawberryfire by The Apples In Stereo. Suddenly, this warm, melting feeling came over me, like I was turned into butter and I was becoming a piece of toast. The song radiated a flanging effect that cuddled my senses. I was so immersed in the song that I didn't even notice Pickle laughing his ass off. I'm thinking that this is the first experience of true euphoria I had, because I was laughing my ass off too! Not because of a funny joke, but because my heart felt so good!



I also had very pleasant visual stimulation. There seemed to be a blanket of hues moving like a snake alongside the ground, like the northern lights, but so close to the ground and me! The song changed to `Ruby' and the hues started to become soft and energetic like dancing, blurry pixels. I could've sworn that I saw smiling faces but I try to think the opposite as that would sound a bit cliché, wouldn't it? The effects started to wear off, flanging was gone, colors are gone, euphoria is still there, and as were Pickle's. We both went for another whippet. This time I had twice the amount of nitrous (from a bigger charger I presume) and the taste was different this time.



It was like cotton candy and wasn't as pure but still enjoyable. Anyways, the flanging effect came back, though not as strong. ``The Shiney Sea'', one of my favorite songs of all time, was playing and it moved me in some scary, unearthly way. I was almost on the verge to panicking when Pickle said `look at the stars'. I looked up and my breath was taken away. I could see the sky evolving through my eyes, like a supernova consumed the earth and I was seeing the activity inside. The sky quickly changed from the black night to a comprised rainbow cacophony of white diamond stars expelling this radiation into the colors, making them seem like a eloquent, omnipresent being.



The sky pulsated with greens and pinks that overlapped the clouds, which saturated all color and turned into some disgusting brown puke-like substance that I thought was just pleasant. I'm not being sarcastic, it really was great for some reason. The fading of this extravagant nebula disappointed me but I kept thinking that I had one whippet left, so my spirits were raised. I waited till the effects were completely gone, and asked Pickle for the last whippet. He already gave in into his last whippet and was giggling like a schoolgirl (no stereotyping, just the nature of it!). I breathed in the succulent air and once again it was different in taste again. This time it tasted like some liquid majesty and the purest taste yet. I changed the CD from The Apples to ``Space And Time: A Compendium of The Orange Alabaster Mushroom'' (one of the greatest neo-psychedelic albums of all-time). 



There was no flanging effect but more of a wider-range effect as reported with mushrooms.  This made the song ``Ethel Tripped A Mean Gloss'' really echoed and awesome (awesome as in epic, not cool). The peak was more gradual in this try than the others, so I knew that the best was yet to come. I quickly switched the track to Track 9, ``Space in Time'', which is a truly grand song.  The pulsing beats of the bass seemed to make my empty surrounding bounce and vibrate. The totally unexpected happened. My entire perception of sight was warped beyond comprehension, as if a black hole was formed and totally stretched out time into\ldots I can only describe it as `a just'. Everything became spaghetti from that singularity and the song became so distorted that it seemed to mend in with the night's silence.



My mind died for a split second. For a split second, all I ever thought or perceived became nothing, just blank. I wanted to scream, but there was no such thing as screaming. There wasn't even such a thing as sound, or a sense, or a field to put things into. When I regained my understanding of the world around me, I felt relieved and the happiest yet. All I wanted to do is hug Pickle for being the only shred of reality I knew of. In the back of my mind, I couldn't believe how intense that was. I want to call this a Level 2 trip, but I just couldn't believe how screwed up things got, like a glitch in a computer that copies of images on your computer until it seems like a tile. After relaxing on the grass in the dark for a while, we shared each other's experiences. Pickle was skeptical about how intense I got it, as he only experienced what I felt on my second time. 



Reflecting about my night with nitrous, I believed that the second inhalation was my most memorable as the final one was too scary for me. Throughout the night, I did feel Nitrous' amazing painkilling effect. I was too amazed by the other things to tell it to Pickle. I have kept dreaming about how exquisitely incredible the starry night sky was to me. We thought it was incredible that the span of the experience was only 20 minutes, as it felt like days to me. After a great night's rest, I felt totally relaxed and smooth in following day. I took the vitamins and headed out back to Nebraska. I consider this to be my most powerful moment with psychoactives yet. A lot of my friends don't believe that I got the bizarre effects from nitrous oxide, and I believe them. I read other experiences and found them to be somewhat milder than mine. Nitrous is a unique gas that I suggest to any daring psychonaut.
