I use alcohol and marijuana on a regular basis, and every few months I try to experience something `new'. I decided it was time for poppy seed tea when I found a relatively new provider of pods and exchanged a few encrypted emails with her. I ordered my poppy pods from a supplier online after reading, reading, and reading about making the tea and the harrowing accounts of poppy tea addiction. I've tried a few opiates but never had a desire to try them again for quite a long time, so I wasn't worried about addiction so much. Just, you know, the DEA and the correct dosage.



When my box got here with the pods, I knew I had the `real deal'. In fact, the letter the seller sent me practically came with instructions - i.e. recommendations for my `project' saying that basically, 3-6 pods per `project' were definately enough. The pods were varied in shape and color, and I read somewhere that the darker the pod, the higher the alkaloid levels. 





Process of making the tea:



I knew I would be sharing with two people, so I took 11 pods, emptied the seeds and set them aside, and ground up the pods themselves in the coffee grinder. I will say this is MESSY. No matter what, a ton of the powder escaped into the air. It smelled like organic matter, dusty. I boiled 6 cups of water. I was trying to water down the tea without burning out the opiates. I took the pot off of the heat as soon as the water began boiling and added powder from the pods. I let it soak for quite a while, as the pot \& water took a long, long time to cool down. The filtering out of the sludge made everything super nasty. Sludge was green - the tea itself, a dark orangish-brown with a strong herbal scent. I have very little sense of smell myself, but it was relatively pungent. 



The water steamed for actually about 40 minutes. That's what I get for having expensive pots and pans. I switched pots at some point and steam was still coming out! Next time, I decided, I will not bring the water to a full boil because it probably wore down the effectiveness. However, the seller had warned me that these pods were basically strong. When the tea cooled, I poured three even pint glasses, squeezed out half a lemon into each and added a ton of sugar. Still nasty, but more bearable! 





Experience:



I warned everybody not to drink the tea too fast, that they might get sick, of course, no one listened. Do our friends EVER listen? After about 20 minutes my hands got cold and I felt a slight tremor. Nobody else seemed to feel a thing and proceeded to complain that I had been scammed. I went up to the computer to check out how long its supposed to take, decided we probably had to wait 45 minutes, and let it kick in. 



It did. Hard. I felt warm waves all over me, coupled with some unpleasant nausea and a strange gas that had me belching every few minutes. Every muscle in my body felt relaxed. My friend, R, who was experienced in many, many drugs, fell in love with the stuff. He was quite chatty and full of energy. The other, M, complained of feeling nothing except sick and hot. Within two hours of drinking the tea, however, it hit us all like a ton of bricks. M became near-catatonic, then quietly blissfull, a big relaxed smile on his face. R, with his rather larger tolerance for drugs,  was asking me to make more tea. I wanted to lay down on the soft couch. No, I wanted to go outside and lay back and relax and watch the full moon. No, I wanted to talk about anything and everything under the sun. I wanted to prolong the glow.



Under the auspices of really impaired judgement, I decided to prepare the rest of the tea. M was was asking for more now, too. I ground it up, made a horrible mess, and added less water than before. This time I threw the tea in a coffee pot and had the water go through the filter. The resulting tea was much stronger smelling and darker orange. 



By now, M was on the couch, complaining of feeling sick. R was elated. He drank his tea quickly, again. I sipped on mine and put M's in the fridge. I ended up throwing up. It was quick, though, and I immediately felt much better, surprisingly. I decided to put my tea away. R immediately announced he was going home. He lives about 3 blocks away, so I wasn't worried. I laid on the couch and M put on some jazz. I closed my eyes, feeling really out of it, my mind awake, my body totally relaxed. My imagination was really vivid and I fell between half-dream states and sleep. I wasn't very tired, just really relaxed, but I remember saying something like, `It's like my body is in a coma and my mind wants to go on a walk.' M understood completely. We were both still really fucked up, relaxed, having vivd daydreams. We drank the tea originally around 11PM, it was now 4AM. No sign of the effects slowing. We both passed into a trancelike sleep. My dreams were really vivid, I remember waking once or twice and feeling very, very comfortable. I like the tea! 





There's still a bunch of tea leftover, I decided to freeze it and try to extract the goo to add to pot or something. If it doesn't work, though, I still have the crushed pods and I understand that you can `recycle' them and extract more - kind of like coffee, the second pot is weaker. I'm not too worried about it. I know where to get the pods and I am definitely not excited about the prospect of an opiate addiction. So, a special treat might be `tea night' once a month or so. Nothing more. Anyway, it was an overall good experience! I liked it, although I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who hasn't at least had a codeine tablet before. It is a strong sedative-like drug, not for the physically active types.
