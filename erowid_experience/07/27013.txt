Valium first entered my life when I was 21, and hanging out with a recovering heroin addict. He liked the drug in high doses because it reminded him of heroin, I liked it in low doses because it gave me that reassuring feeling of `that's ok.' In the seven years since being introduced to valium, I've found that being able to induce the `that's ok' feeling is VERY USEFUL.



It should be noted that the first time I took valium, I ended up having my first threesome, something that my own sexual anxiety never would have let happen had I been sober. When things started happening between the three of us, I just thought to myself, `that's ok,' and let them happen. I thank valium for that. HOWEVER! It should also be noted that it was an threesome without condoms (me thinking, `no condoms? that's ok\ldots `), which leads me to my first point: VALIUM CAN LEAD TO BAD DECISION-MAKING, sexual and otherwise. When you think 'that's ok' about everything, it can get you into situations both bad and good.



I've used valium dozens of times as a come-down aid, taking low doses (2.5 - 5 mg) after a nights of doing ecstasy, acid, speed, coke, etc. I have reached a point in my life, in fact, where I won't go UP on any drug without having a way back DOWN, ie a `parachute' of valium. It's interesting to note that at these low dosages, valium doesn't necessarily make you fall asleep after a night of partying (takes more like 20 mg for that), but does take the edge off. 



For example, around hour 7 of an acid trip, I typically get cranky and gritty from lack of sleep, food, the come-down, etc. Taking 2.5 mg of valium doesn't really take those bad feelings away, it just makes me think, `Oh. I feel tired and gritty and cracked out\ldots .that's ok!' It's a nice way to quiet a come-down, and at low dosages, you can still enjoy the ends of the trip. 



As I said, at higher dosages, it will cleanly knock you out, which can also be nice. Doing valium to help me sleep after a night of partying has helped me realize that a big chunk of that `cracked out' post-ecstasy, speed, or acid feeling is simply sleep-deprivation and exhaustion. If I sleep solidly on valium after doing an `awake' drug, I find myself waking in much better shape than if I'd had a normal post-drug sleep. It does not, however, take care of that `tuesday bluesday' feeling post-ecstasy.



Valium also has great pragmatic uses such as calming down my boyfriend (deathly afraid of flying) on airplanes. His experiences seem to mirror my own: he still expresses fear while flying, but has this general feeling of, `Hmm, this is scary. That's ok.' We've also used higher dosages of valium (5 - 10 mg) on longer flights (8+ hours) to knock ourselves out for the whole duration of the trip. It's useful to help you reset your clock when dealing with jetlag -- when arriving at your destination, simply take a valium when you `should' go to bed, destination time. It's much easier than fighting with your jetlagged body and trying to make it sleep.



Valium was nicknamed `mother's little helper' for a reason: it makes any stress-inducing situation just fine. HOWEVER: if you overuse it, it seems to lower people's ability to deal with ANY sort of stressful situation, ie, `Oh my god! I need to wash the dishes. Oh shit. I can't deal with this pressure. I NEED A VALIUM.' I'm sort of kidding here, but this drug is definitely habit-forming and very addictive. No joke. Be careful. I prefer to save my valium use for drug come-downs or travel. I start to feel sketchy about it as a general sleeping pill because it is so additive.
