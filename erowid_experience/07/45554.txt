I took the first hit and held it as long as I could, as my brother took his hit. He handed the bowl back and I had another hit. I'm not sure if I held it in as long or not; everything after that was hazy. My brother swears we were talking but I don't remember that; all I know is that in his ten by twelve foot room, things were crazy.



The room divided itself, so to speak. Let me describe the room and my perspective first. Scanning from the top: There was a plain wooden shelf with something-or-other on it, then my brother's navy blue bed up against the wall, then my legs on the chair I was sitting on. The shelf seemed to extend a border, or `divide the room' seems to be the best way to explain. Tripping is nice and irrational like that. Well, the far edge of the bed represented the next division, then the close edge of the bed, and then there was a division behind me that I sensed. When I looked around, I couldn't tell if we were in his room or not, it seemed like the room was a part of our living room behind us. I began to get confused about what was going on, and an uncomfortable wave of energy seemed to crash over my back, centered on my heart chakra (the heart chakra is located very near the heart and is the emotional center).



My brother says that I started to lean forward and get really smiley. Soon after I began to laugh uncontrollably. I tried to hold it back, at first, but to no avail. When I finally cracked up, it was pretty fun. I tried to tell my brother about the status of his room, which he also experienced, but I don't think it came through. Probably just hysterics. However, the confusion feeling was dominating: I felt I couldn't recognize the room and I quickly grew a distaste for it. I decided I had had enough and went to see my mom, leaving my confused virgin-tripper brother to his own devices.



For whatever reason, I was compelled to hold my mom's hand, or to have her hold mine, or some of both. I was twenty-six, by the way, and my brother was eighteen. So I come out of my brother's room and I told my mom that I needed her help and asked her to be nice. She's done her share of plants so I wasn't too worried, but I needed to make sure she would be nice. I raved about things for a while. A visiting neighbor went to take care of my brother. Time flew by far faster than I realized: it only seemed like a couple of minutes with my mom, but she reported it as eight to ten. I focused on the TV, talking about how it was soothing, though I'm interested to see what was really happening, and I gradually returned to normal. The whole event took fifteen to twenty minutes at the most. I wasn't pleased with the confusion feeling.



After a while, my curiosity overrode my displeasure and my brother and I decided to have another try. We went outside and had ourselves another hit. It was dusk, and we were sitting on black iron patio furniture. I didn't hold this hit so long and seemingly nothing happened. I was timing it, too. Something I had meant to do the time before but totally forgot. My brother started to get silly, leaning forward with a strange facial expression, and then asked, `Why do we even have these?' referring to our fence with a vine of some kind on it. It took him about seventy-five seconds. He came down pretty quickly with not so much else to say, though he explained later that he was compelled to explain himself.



I had another hit, one that I proudly held for a good, long time. My dog wanted to go back inside, so I went to let him in, and that's when it hit me. It took forty-five seconds, maybe. Probably more like forty, though who knows how well my mental math skills worked then. A strange wave washed over me, which is how I knew: a wave of excitement, a fun wave. I sat down as fast as I could and fell into hysterics again. I started to get ideas about something about people in the neighborhood or something, and had another strange bout of spacial distortion. Then, the same wave washed over my heart chakra.



One instant, I was laughing my ass off, and the next, my face was stern and serious. I had decided that I definitely didn't like this trip, and told my brother so: `I know I was just laughing, but I hate this.' I sat thinking that now I had to wait until this crap ended, and decided that if that was the case, I was going to go sit with my mom again. She, my other brother and our neighbor friend were watching a movie so I kept quiet. However, as I went to sit down, our neighbor cried in disgusted surprise in reaction to the movie, and I felt she was crying in reaction to me. I cleared my head about that, held my mom's hand, and came back down.



I went back to my brother's room and we discussed how things went. I had little waves where I thought I might trip again and it made me angry. I didn't want to feel this again and I knew I would have no choice once it started. I'm not sure if my resolve prevented any further episodes, as the episodes never lasted that long anyway, but the trips had already ended for the evening. He said he liked it. He didn't react to the heart chakra wave the same way I did.



For the rest of the evening, I felt angry with the experience. This is strange for me as I don't get angry about things easily. My brother's friend said he tried the same stuff and had a similarly bad reaction, but had some of another type and it was alright. So I thought I'd try it again sometime, though that time hasn't come yet.
