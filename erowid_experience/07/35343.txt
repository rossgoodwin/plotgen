I hadn't had much time off work lately, so scheduling this trip wasn't easy. I had a Tuesday off, and decided to do it Monday night after work. However, work exhausted me, so Tuesday it was. I spent the day reading the end of `The Servants of Twilight' by Dean Koontz (I didn't want to keep wondering about it while tripping!), playing guitar, and checking some cds out from the library. I went to a friend's house at 7:30 P.M., watched them play video games; and then played guitar. They were smoking marijuana, but I did not. However, I couldn't not help inhaling some of the smoke. I certainly did not get enough to have much of an effect, but it may have had some effect on my trip. I ate one piece of pizza at around 9:30 P.M. I went home at 11:00 P.M., stopping at the grocery store for grapefruit juice. Got home around 11:30 P.M., and asked the I Ching what substance to ingest. It was either to be 2C-E or DiPT, and I was favoring DiPT (simply because it wasn't as intense/longlasting, and I was tired). I have tried a small dose of 2C-E once, and it didn't do much. That was before I got a scale, and I estimated it to be 6 milligrams. I've also tried DiPT twice before. 



The I Ching read 48 The Well, changing to 32 Steadfastness (with a line reading `befits a ritual occasion'). The Well began with a T (Two C - E), so it was decided. I measured out 10 milligrams on the scale, and swallowed it in grapefruit juice. I did not taste it at all, which was probably a blessing. After writing my dose and time in my trip notebook, I went on a short walk down the street. Nothing eventful happened, I felt a slight increase in perception, but nothing much. I got home, and at 12:17 A.M., I wrote `Fairly sure it's starting'. 10 minutes later, listening to American Indian music (which was very beautiful), I remembered these feelings that almost always come up at the beginning of trips. They are indescribable, like something from when I was younger. I realized I need to be more in touch with my emotions, all the time.



I did some stretching, and at 12:42 A.M., I saw my pupils were dilated. At this time, I noticed maybe the most disturbing aspect of the trip: my sinuses were very dried up and I felt congestion in my throat. This continued throughout the trip, and while I know being around the marijuana smoke beforehand had something to do with it, I also think 2C-E might have had some direct action on my sinuses. I don't want to scare anyone, maybe it was nothing and maybe it was an allergic reaction. It never once became dangerous, although in my paranoid state, I thought it might be. I felt a little nausea at times, but nothing that was a problem.



1:03 A.M.: I was clenching my teeth some, and felt lots of warmth. It was all smooth though, very unlike 4-HO-DiPT (which comes on, for me, in 5 minutes and is like getting sucked UP a mountainside). 



1:19 A.M.: It is Happening. I can choose to let go and flow with it, or remain clear-headed. I was scared of the congestion at this point. So much was going on. I had open-eye visuals, staring at the ceiling and walls. The ceiling would wave, and once it transformed into what looked like candy. The wooden walls were melting, exactly like what 4-HO-DiPT did to me. But these visuals were not overwhelming or even constant. They only happened when I focused for a couple seconds. My theory is that these `visuals' are the result of an intense mental concentration, which while sober is very difficult to achieve. Even while sober, I see similar waves in the ceiling if I focus (while meditating), but nothing like the wooden walls melting/changing. 



The first serious thing that happened was, I was staring at the light fixture on my ceiling, and it transformed (not physically, mentally) into SOMETHING, and my entire being felt threatened. Like everything I ever was, could change at this second. Stuff like this is why I take psychedelics, but at the same time, it's not something I can just casually say `Okay, I'm dying. Cool' to. Sometimes, it is a struggle. 



At 1:50 A.M., I wrote `Any more than this, I would cease to exist.' I was resisting ego death, but it was happening all around me. I knew that if I had taken 2 more milligrams, the trip would have been too much to handle at this time. I hadn't even prepared for this. I was scared I would never ever snap out of this trip. It was that intense.  I was listening to an Acid Mothers Temple bootleg, and then Larry Coryell. I put on `Salvial' by Tool, and turned out the lights for `Third Eye'. I could see energy floating in the darkness, but I wasn't frightened of the dark. But I was scared, just of anything. I had to force myself to lie there and listen. When Maynard screamed, I saw an owl, and a hawk, like another place and time. That song was truly mindblowing, `So good to see you, I missed you so much'. The `Prying open my third eye' part sent waves of color pounding through my head, and it is vivid even now. 



I won't bother trying to recall other details. At 2:56 A.M., I finally felt like I was going to live (which meant I might be coming down). A little later, I watched `Star Wars' and ate some frozen strawberries. They did not upset my stomach. I went to sleep in between 4:45 A.M. and 5:00 A.M., and did not have a problem falling asleep (5 hours after ingestion). The intense effects were mostly gone at that point. I woke at 9:30 A.M. because of the phone, and had to watch `The Empire Strikes Back' to help me fall back asleep. I went to work later that day, at 6:00 P.M., and had no problems. 



Others have compared 2C-E to LSD, and while I have never taken it, I have ingested morning glory seeds. I would say 2C-E is somewhat like morning glories, but not as friendly. For me, it was a teacher and not a friend. It was not afraid to rip my mind apart and show me the pieces. I would encourage taking care with the dose, as 10 milligrams had a PROFOUND effect on me. Nothing I couldn't safely handle by myself, but it was pretty crazy.
