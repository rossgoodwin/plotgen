Having no deep spiritual need to trip, no unresolved questions on which to ponder, and a fresh supply of 2C-I, Catfish found himself in a wee bit of a quandry. Does one require a reason to trip? If you start tripping without an unwavering intent of where you want to direct the psychedelic energies, is it merely escapism? Psychonautical wanking? I sat around for three days pondering this in my spare time. Every now and then picking up the small bag of clumpy off white powder and staring at it, as if expecting it to say, `eat me'. It was plain ole curiousity that won out in the end. I felt confident knowing that the scorpion sting of curiousity is reserved for the cat, and not for me, for tonight I am Lab Rat.



(10:26 PM)



So, down the rat hole I went, 25 mg 2C-I, oral in a gelcap. I chose my dosage based upon my experiences with other 2C drugs, 2CT2 and 2CT7. I had drank a cup of coffee within the last hour, which may have contributed in some way to the experience. Earlier on, while I was measuring out my dose, I tasted a wee speck of the powder and was surpirsed to find it almost tasteless, or at least when compared to the extreme bitterness of other research chemicals. The powder itself resembled flour.



(11:03)



First alert coming on slowly. A slight chest rush is developing. It is soft warm glowing sensation which feels quite nice, like a hug from an old friend. Slight tension in my lower jaw area, nothing troublesome at this point. I am salivating like a hungry dog however. Perma grin smile forms around 11:15 and is pinned to my visage like a mask for the rest of the evening. Several times I had to stop whatever it was I was doing in order to relax, take deep breaths and relax my cheeks because they hurt from too much smiling. At this point it is safe to say that my mood is floating upwards like a hot air balloon. My head certainly felt as if it were,' in the clouds' as I could feel a fluffiness pervading my skull. Fluffhead as Phish would sing\ldots 



(11:23)



A wonderful body buzz has wrapped itself around me like a silken sheet against bare flesh on a summer night. It is fun to touch things and feel their tecture. I close my eyes and handle familair objects, trying to translate what I feel into an imagined copy of it in my thoughts. This exercise certainly helped center my awareness, which was growing more and more scattered as the effect of the 2C-I began to increase. Within a few minutes I start to notice slight swirls and psychedelic eddies flowing across the carpet and cinder block walls. Watching the flame of a candle is calming as well, I can see tiny sparks leaping from the body of the flame, as if  it is stretching for the sky. I get up and look in the mirror. My pupils are well dilated. I saw on the Learning Channel that dilated pupils are seen as a sign that we are attracted to what we are looking at. Staring through the veils of my humdrum routines and worker bee existence, my pupils are ready to swallow whole what lies before them.



(12:00 AM)



I am nearing a +++, quite close but I know that the ride isn't over yet, not even close. Playing guitar yields fresh and innovative licks. I am in the flow, no thoughts, just my hands and my ears working as one. The visuals have become quite engrossing by now. Everywhich way I look, I see a hodgepog of neon swirls, waves, and tracers. Geometry tubes and other Final Fantasy Ghost looking hullucinations move about the room, gliding eerily through and over objects. After a while, it is quite hard to convince myself that these hangers about are products of my mind. I start to believe that they are sentient energetic beings, that I have recalibrated my senses to pick up a weak signal from higher frequency realities.



I lay on my black leather sofa, sinking back staring at the phantasmagoric ballet floating about the dark, candlelit basement. Didgeridoo music garbles away in the background, reminding me to which reality I belong, grounding me.







(1:44) 



Listening to Tortoise's `Standards' in headphones is blowing the fuse box in my brain to smithereens. Behind closed eyes, I sense an imense yellow-green radiating sphere. I feel a sort of gravitational pull towards the light, the sensation is centered around my third eye area. I feel as if some part of me is being tugged through this area, as if I were falling into myself. The feeling was not too dissimilar from the falling sensation felt before sleep. As I began to undertsand myself to be moving closer towards the light, I heard a voice informing me over and over in a sing songy ghostly whisper, `you're a dreamer, not a genius\ldots ` This phrase swept over me like a lullaby as I moved deeper and deeper into the radiance. Losing myself in the realization of my lot in life.



(2:33)



Unfortunately, my puppy had to piddle and his whimpering broke the spell I was under. The light slowly recoiled back into itself and was swallowed back into the nothing. I felt higher than I have felt in quite a while. I was bordering on the delusional state induced by high level DXM doses. To top that, I still feel as if I there is more terrain to climb on Mt. 2C-I. I am not standing on the peak quite yet. I venture outside to smoke a bowl. This instantly brings some peace of mind back, I can feel the soft cradle of THC rock my hopped up mind softly back and forth. I feel secure in my abilty to discern between what is real and what is not\ldots 



Moments after having this thought, I glance skywards to watch the night sky, only to see a smiling Mayan Shaman trickster type peering down at me from a Maple tree in my back yard. Startled, I had to suppress a yelp. Nervously, I peek back up at the tree only to see a cluster of tree branches where I had seen the merry prankster a moment ago. Somehow, I am not so sure that what I saw was not true. It was such a lucid and clear image that I can't imagine that my mind could construct it. Rarely do I have visual disortions/ hallucinations in which the scene is so `real.'

I feel well above a +++ experience, I glance at my skin and see a myriad of fluid hieroglyphic tattoos. I can't see behind the visuals, it is as if my skin has actually become this symbolic fluid. The room is awash with so much movement, I am beginning to lose track of where exactly I am at points. There is no way I could be in public at this level. Who knows what mishaps might occur.



(3:15)



Heavy jaw tension has settled in. It is rather annoying and uncomfortable. I have a bit of a sore throat like feeling that I associate with the jaw tension. I decide to take .5 mg clonazepam to help alleviate the situation. I should have done this sooner, but I was in no mind to think ahead. The jaw tension gets worse over the next 30 minutes so I decide to have a couple of beers to help relax. By the time I have finished them, the clonazepam has kicked in and I am feeling much better by 4 am. I smoke a bowl to celebrate. Visuals have slowed but are still quite active. I am back to a level in which I can discern what is real and what isn't.

While, throughout the night I had felt like I was moving along at lightspeed, I now felt slow and sticky minded due to the booze and clonazepam.  



I eat some turkey hoping the l-tryptofan will take me by the hand off to beddy ye land eventually, and replace some of that free floating serotnin that I like so much! 



(6:00 am) I am groggy enough to drop off to sleep by now. I fade away into dreams, remembering the mantra I heard while lost in the radiant yellow-green light earlier,'you're a dreamer, not a genius\ldots ' and everything is starting to make sense again.





I felt no real nausea with 2C-I, perhaps some slight stomach tension, but nothing worth worrying about. Slight leg twitching in the hamstring area was present during the take off. The jaw tension was troubling however. I feel that 2C-I is much more potent than its counterparts 2CT2 and 2CT7. 25 mg was a bit too much. Next time I will experiment with say 15-20 mg. But, in retrospect, I was floored by the multifaceted quality of this drug. It was immensely visual, music was greatly enhanced, my thoughts were gilded in the juices of creativity, and my body was awash with a pleasurable glow somewhat akin to 5MeO-DiPT or 4-ACO-DipT, though not as erotic. I predict this one will soon be all the rage.
