This story is about the most world shattering experience I have ever had. It is the kind of thing you can't fully grasp unless you have done it. I haven't wanted to write about it until now because it is beyond what most people can understand. I still feel like iI'm having side effects from this 2C stuff almost a year after I quit taking it. Slightly over a year ago, I ordered 100 mg of 2C-E from an online vendor. Little did I know that swallowing 25mg of this stuff would be one of the most intense experiences of my life. More hardcore than every single time I have taken ecstasy. Which I have done around 20 times. In some ways, more hardcore than even LSD.



When the package first arrived I was very happy because I knew an exciting time awaited. It was in a plastic bag with skulls and crossbones labeled, `Not for human consumption - Toxic.' I had bought 2C-E from people who had cut it down so I figured that this stuff would affect me the same. That was a big mistake on my part. Rather than taking pihkal's minimum mentioned dosage, I took the maximum. 100mg was divided into four seemingly equal lines. I noticed that 2C compounds like to stick to glass. I ate roughly 25mg. Very shortly I could feel it in my stomach. I knew that feeling could only mean that something powerful was coming on. But I didn't know how powerful yet.



Approximately 30 minutes after taking the stuff I got seriously ill. I never imagined that drugs could hurt me so bad. The next two hours consisted of me leaning over a trash can puking. It felt so bad that I wondered if I was going to die. Sometime before those two hours were up I began to hallucinate vividly. It was far beyond any trip I had ever took previously. It was more overwhelming than any trip I have took since. LSD makes me hallucinate much more than 2C-E, but LSD isn't nearly as bad for me as 2C-E.



After the first hour of puking, I layed down in my bed wishing I had never taken this. I was wasted beyond what I ever imagined I could be. My bed's quilt is contorting and changing colors. Colors look so much richer and darker than before. Everything leaves trails behind for over 10 seconds. I try to force some milk down to feel better, but I puke it up after 1-2 minutes. After about an hour in bed, the severe vomiting stops. I must have hurled at least 10 times. After I gain a little more control of myself, my friend Andrew calls me. When he asks me what I am doing all I can say is, `I'm tripping the fuck out man!' Neither one of us will ever forget this day. After 2-3 minutes on the phone I return to my bed until he arrives. When he steps into my room, I am laying in bed, holding my quilt, laughing insanely. I am completely in the grip of 2C-E now.



Over two hours after taking the stuff, I realize that I am not going to die. When he first arrived, I was still in so much pain that I didn't want to get out of bed. There was 75mg of 2C-E sitting on a mirror on my couch. I gave him around 50mg because I was so far from reality that I needed anybody to be on a level slightly close to me. He said he took 25mg in two seperate doses that night. He didn't puke like me. I got out of bed and we contemplated what to do. I was shaking violently and uncontrollably. Trying to recall simple things such as how far point A is from point B had become impossible.



We decided to go swimming. The problem was that the swimming hole with clean, spring fed water is about 8 miles away. Completely lacking my sense of judgement, I say that we should go swimming in a much closer spot (where swimming is banned). So we walk down to the local forest preserve. On the way, a few neighbors see us and it is obvious how trashed we are. Once at the park, we jump into the muddy water. Another huge mistake. While in the water, everything is fine. As soon as we get out of the water, we run through a bunch of poison ivy and mosquitoes because we are too wasted to know any better. Needless to say that we got jacked up. Out legs are beet red and I am covered in mosquito bites. One the way back, my neighbors set off smoke bombs because they knew something was up. When we got back to my house, we tried to get our bearings.



It's around 3 hours after first dosing. We lay on the couches in my basement, rubbing calamine lotion on our legs. I am guessing it was around this time Andrew started coming up because he said he had a familiar feeling like the 2C was ripping his guts up. Although my puking has ceased, I am still in a lot of pain. We both take showers to clean filth from the park off of us. After the shower, I lay back down on the couch watching the walls move and the colors change. Andrew decides that he wants to go to his house. I go with him and pick up some taco bell on the way. By now, I can keep food down and the pain is becoming less. When we get to his house basically all we do is laugh about things that aren't even that funny. We are so wasted that we cannot stop laughing. We decide we should leave because his parents are probably wondering why we are laughing nonstop and a TV isn't even on.



So off we go to another park. On the way there, more neighbors give us a `what is wrong with these kids' treatment. We are being loud and belligerent on the streets. The neighbors are acting as strange as we are. I remember laying down at the park looking at the stars. They seem to be moving around. It is around 5-6 hours after dosing. We are acting so out of our heads at the park that some neighbors are standing in their doorway looking at us. I don't know how long they were watching us, but as soon as I noticed them we decided to leave. As soon as we started to leave, they slammed their door. I am guessing they called the cops. I also think my timing was just right. A block away from the park a cop car rolls right in front of us. This is really strange because there is no crime in this part of town. They obviously weren't looking for criminals. Andrew also notices and points that out. We decide not to go back to Andrew's house because his parents already know something is going on. Instead, we go to our friend Adam's house. Adam is hanging out with his friend Jenny and they are messing around on his couch. I sat in his room for about 1 minute before bursting out into laughter for no real reason. Big secret that I am extremely tripped out.



We didn't stay at Adam's long. Jenny drove us around for a while. Andrew was trying to score some pot so we had to drive to the other side of town. Getting that pot became a big hassle and we ended up killing a bunch of time in the car. I remember going by a hospital and there were lots of lights. I couldn't take my eyes off of them. I also played with Jenny's flashing flip-flops. Undoubtedly for when she was on ecstasy. 



For the rest of the trip we stayed at Adam's. All we really did was laugh about stupid stuff. At one point we decided to scrape Adam's pipe for resin. We smoked a nickel bag with some resin between the three of us. We were still so jacked from the 2C that none of us even felt the weed. There was really no point to smoking it. Around 13-14 hours after first dosing, my trip had mostly worn off. Although I wasn't really tripping anymore, my mind and body had been devestated. The side effects still seem to linger to this day. When I think about it, I can taste 2C-E. Very often, I see things that aren't even there.



I still felt ravaged from that trip three days later. Regrettably, I had not completely learned my lesson yet. I still had 25mg of 2C-E. The next time I took it, I realized that 12mg would be more than enough. 



ishing that I could take all the 2C I wanted turned out to be a terrible idea. Now that I have done it, I wish that I hadn't have done it. This has to be one of the most mind blowing chemicals out there. And also one of the most dangerous. 25mg of 2C-E was the first thing to scare me away from awful basement chemicals. Unfortunately, I ended up having such a wonderful time that it didn't scare me as much as it should have. Even though I was never the same again.
