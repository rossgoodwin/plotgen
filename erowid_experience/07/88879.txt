I would say that I am a rather adventurous person. I'm always looking for ways to enhance my life and to give it more depth. I am a firm believer that hallucinogens are just the right substance to really give my life that extra degree of depth that I crave.  In the past I have had experiences with amphetamines, opiates, dxm, shrooms, benzos, and 2c-i. All of these things have proven themselves to me in their ability to enhance my perception of reality. As I said, I have done 2c-i before but at a really low dose (roughly 10 mg or less). This resulted in the most epic night of video games I had ever experienced. I felt literally IN the game. Every video game victory felt like a real life victory. New Super Mario Bros is a great 2c-i multiplayer game let me tell you. That experience left me with a sense of satisfaction and contentment that I had never experienced before. I then had a thirst to experience 2c-i again and in a much larger dose. I felt this drug had so much potential to make a profound impact on me. I would soon find out that it did indeed make a deep profound impact on me, but not at ALL like I was expecting or wanted.

	

Months went by after my first 2c-i experience. Then one day I get a call from my friend, who I will call ``Bob'', who told me that he just received 250 mg of 2c-i and that he needed help dividing it equally into caps. This sparked a lot of excitement in me for I knew that the only person Bob would experiment with 2c-I with was me. Bob, by the way, was with me during my first 2c-i experience and held a similar view of the experience. So now we're at his house dividing out roughly 16 mg dose of 2c-I into 16 capsules. The bits of powder left over from filling each cap eventually accumulated into roughly two small lines of 2c-i: One for me, and one for Bob. This was at about 8:00 PM. We weren't planning on taking 2c-i tonight but then decided it was an insignificant amount that no harm would be done. We each proceeded to insufflate one of the lines. 



I would like to note that insufflating 2c-i can feel like fire in your nose, along with a nasty drip afterwards. After the irritation subsided I realized that my allergies were acting up (Bob has cats and I'm allergic). I proceeded to take a zyrtec to eliminate these bothersome symptoms. It helped with noticeable success. 

	

Over the course of the next half hour Bob and I just talked and played video games as we were coming up. I soon started to notice colors to appear a lot more vibrant, and some faint halos of glowing light hovering around objects. Then warm waves of euphoria began to gently wash over me with a progressively greater intensity. Bob and I were now starting to really get into this new Donkey Kong game for the Wii. I swear that 2c-i is the best drug to play video games on. Anyway, we played that for about a half hour and the effects of the drug remained steady during this time. 



At this point we are notified that Bob's relatives are stopping by to drop off some furniture and to hang out. Bob and I went outside to wait for his relative's car and during this time we talked and just gazed at things for a bit. The sparkles in the snow sparkled so brilliantly, the street lamps emitted a sort of visual vibration, and this one tree was warping shape and shifting colors very subtly. It was really a beautiful sight, and Bob agreed with me and marveled at the often unnoticed beauty of nature. Squinting my eyes brought on gradually increasing visuals that eventually enveloped my entire field of vision. Blue wire frame structures formed where objects were. Bob's relatives then pulled into the driveway and we put on our best sober faces and moved the furniture into the house. We then proceeded down to the basement while Bob's relatives hung out upstairs watching tv. 

	

The effects of the 2c-i were coming on a lot stronger now, but then felt a little muted for me. This was probably due to the drowsy side effects of the zyrtec I took earlier. The clock on my phone read 9:45 PM and both of us decided to each do more 2c-i just for the hell of it. We made 2 lines of about 20 mg each and each insufflated a line of this mysterious substance. The burn was much worse than the first time and it persisted for about more 15 minutes. After the irritation subsided, Bob and I resumed playing our video games. Suddenly I could feel myself becoming increasingly absorbed into the game as time went on and the effects of the 2c-i became greater. 



This feeling was wonderful! I felt calm, euphoric, and connected with everything as cheesy as that sounds. Synchronizing my character on the TV with the button smashing I was doing became an elegant art form that provided intense focus and excitement. We then took a quick break to munch on some buffalo wings and French fries. We began to watch the movie Inception which is the perfect movie to watch while under the influence of this drug. It is  very trippy, but also very deep. I was only able to watch the first 5 minutes of it because just then I received a frantic call from my mom who was telling me that she needed to use my car ASAP due to a possible medical emergency with my grandma. I felt everything came at the worst of times which made for a slightly unstable environment. 

	

I was forced to abandon my night of deep conversations, intense video gameing, and insightful movie viewing. Then I started to feel a little uneasy about me doing so. I wasn't very far from my mom's house, and the effects of the 2c-i were extremely easy to keep under control. I drove home with no difficulties, gave the car to my mom, and watched her drive off with my car to check on my grandma (everything turned out fine).  \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#   I was walking around alone in my house wondering what to do, when the effects of the 2c-i started to escalate quite noticeably. 



The time was now roughly 11:15 PM which was an hour and a half after dosing. I decided to just lay down on the couch, watch tv and enjoy the rest of the trip in this calm, safe environment. Another friend then called me and offered to toke up some mary jane with me and some friends. This sounded like an awesome addition to this experience. About 5 minutes after RSVP-ing to this event, my reality suddenly started to become seriously f**ked up.   

	 

I stared at the TV and observed that every frame of this show began merging with the next frames of the show. I also noticed the TV began to lag and then catch back up by going faster. This was definitely an effect of the 2c-i. It started causing a bunch of glitches in my perception of the world. Things began to seem less familiar to me and I began to lose grip of my reality. Colorful tracers followed my field of vision wherever I turned my head. The ceiling fan began to resemble some sort of swirling death blade that gave off a slightly demonic buzzing sound. This was the point at which I realized that these perceptual distortions I was experiencing became too much for me to handle. My motor skills, such as the ability to walk correctly then became noticeably impaired. It was a difficult struggle in order to hold on to reality and my reassuring thoughts. The show on TV ,Jackass, usually provided a lot of laughter, but tonight it took on some very grim, trip altering characteristics.

	

The faces on TV became very distorted and the voices had demonic qualities to them. The overwhelming visual distortions made it very hard to comprehend anything at all and was accompanied  by a really glitchy sounding audio. Songs and sounds from the show skipped at some points, echoed at other points, and were greatly delayed at other times. I thought this was a very fascinating phenomena, but there was just too much stuff going on to be able to handle. I had enjoyed my time up to this point under the influence of this drug, but now I wanted to escape its grasp and just go to sleep. This proved to be a very long and difficult journey.

	

At this point it was only 11:30 PM and I took two 25 mg seroquel pills in an attempt to abort this trip and get some sleep. The effects of the seroquel further altered the twisted reality I was already experiencing. The predicted immediate relief I have come to experience from taking seroquel never occured and if anything it made things worse. All aspects of my perception became even more f**ked up then before. This sudden increase in the intensity of my perceptual distortions marked the point at which my tripped officially turned bad. I constantly checked my pulse in an effort to determine any physical dangers that I could recognize. I decided to go lay down in bed and hoped that the sedative qualities of the seroquel would soon overcome whatever the hell was shattering my reality and guide me into a peaceful slumber.

	

I somehow managed to make it into bed and shut off the lights at about 11:45 PM. As I lay there in the darkness I became worried that the absence of external sensual stimuli would produce a lot of unwanted hallucinations. Hallucinations soon began to form as I closed my eyes. I was astounded by a vast emptiness that surrounded me. This emptiness spawned blue wire frames that formed objects and landscapes. An unexpected yet very powerful feeling of peace and tranquility rushed throughout my body. I then was able to take in an extreme amount of depth and beauty that this newly formed wire frame universe provided. I began to lose focus as some dark thoughts from deep within my mind began to crawl to the surface in an attempt to seize the last tiny bit of reassuring reality that I had been holding with a death grip that evening. My last fragment of hope had just slipped through my fingers which pushed me to insanity.

	

Negative thoughts rapidly bounced around in my head causing me to become very anxious and paranoid. Observing the rate that this bad trip that was currently unfolding, I quickly ran to my medicine cabinet to retrieve 4 more 25 mg seroquel pills. I then took the 4 pills in some sort of desperate attempt to bring this hellish experience to a halt. I soon became very sedated, and with that sedation came an increase in perceptual distortions as before. I came to the conclusion that the sedation was needed and that I would just have to endure the increasing insanity of this experience that the seroquel was adding to.

	

I sat up in bed in the complete darkness. Hallucinations began to form from the little light that was being emitted from my clock. I felt disoriented when I began to wander through this insanely dark and scary amusement park of a bedroom that I was trapped in. I finally reached a light switch and immediately felt a small bit of relief. Recognizing familiar things in my room helped reassure me that I would win this mental battle eventually. I sat down on my bed and stared at the red distorted glow of my wall clock. I made a note that this is what I pictured some heavy lsd trip gone bad to be like. I had to keep my mind focused on something so that I didn't hallucinate as much and to escape from the circular thoughts that pulled me farther into insanity. 

	

I lay down as my black saucer eyes were locked wide open, staring at the clock. All I could think about was how overwhelming everything I perceived was and how much I wanted this violent trip to end. Crazy thoughts filled my head involving the possible consequences of this trip and how this could affect everyone around me. I could not seem to find an escape to this experience and then the feelings of desperation and hopelessness began to peak. I wondered what would happen if I were to die because of this and how people would remember me. A drug-addicted fiend whose dangerous habits lead to his demise? A disappointment to everyone that has ever met? Would I be lumped along with the masses of horrible criminals and addicts deemed worthless rejects by society? These thoughts were synergistic with other thoughts I was having such as being unable to tell anybody about my situation without an immense amount of grief, shame and disappointment soon follow. Going to the hospital seemed like it would make things immensely worse, and cause a lot of negative drama. Then the cold feeling of utter isolation pushed me deeper into this rabbit hole of insanity. I made a voice recording on my phone in hopes that either I would listen to it when I sobered up, or somebody else could listen to it and understand what went on.

	

With my last final ounce of sanity I took 2 final 25 mg pills of seroquel which brought me to 200 mg of seroquel total consumed that night. I sat up in bed and waited for the sedation to flood my body and rescue me from this psycho hell. Slowly but steadily my eyes became heavier and heavier. A sense of relief circulated through my mangled and distorted consciousness. The light at the end of this dark frightening tunnel finally began to manifest itself as I became closer and closer to slipping into a safe, peaceful slumber. With hope now restored in my soul, sedation overcame this demon of a trip and allowed my manic self to finally relax and slip into a peaceful sleep.

	 

The next day I felt just fine. My reality was restored perfectly. The dangerous journey I had completed the night before is now a powerful memorial of a mental battle between an unfortunate, desperate soul against an infinitely mysterious and vast force. I am so glad this experience is over, and I feel as if I have changed a lot as a person due to this experience. I realized that my mind is very resilient and I have the ability to tackle any obstacle. 2c-i can bring on an extremely large range of effects. I learned my lesson to dose low with this because I don't know if I would have the strength to deal with a situation like that again. I am still interested in doing 2c-I again because I feel that it still has a lot of potential to enrich my life in profound ways. I cannot emphasize enough how overwhelming and frightening this experience was though. This was by far the strongest drug experience I have ever encountered. 

	

Basically, this experience crushed my ego and forced it to rebuid itself much stronger. This was the hardest thing I have ever had to go through in my life. But now I can hold my head up high knowing that I won this battle and will always be capable of being victorious as long as I stay focused and strong. Drugs can change ones outlook on life, and add to it many extra dimensions that a completely sober individual would never get to experience. Overcoming this obstacle brings me one step closer to understanding the depth and utter beauty of reality, consciousness, nature, humanity, and the universe. Life contains many often overlooked secrets that are just waiting to be discovered. I plan on discovering every last one of these puzzle pieces in hopes of someday putting together a brilliantly divine portrait of everything that is, has been, or ever will be. What eye opening discoveries await me in this mystical adventure? There is only one way to find out.



I continue onward to the heart of this vast emptiness.  I take a deep cleansing breath as I begin to vanish below the horizon. My journey continues.
