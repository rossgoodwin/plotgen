Only recently have I started to experiment with drugs that are stronger than pot/booze.  I have tried DXM twice with no astounding effects, so I was looking for a unique experience.  Now, don't get me wrong, I am not the type of person to abuse heavy drugs because I have too many people in my family who are or have been addicted to all sorts of shit (pot, booze, coke, possibly crack and heroin too).  Reading the experiences of others has peaked my curiosity in mind exploration and altered realities.  



I have never taken any real hallucinogen before (with the exception of Salvia divinorum) but I did a little research, and decided that it was time for me to see things in a much different light.  After reading several experiences on Dimenhydrinate and after researching it for a while, I decided that this was what I wanted to try.  I have taken Dramamine before for motion sickness I used to get as a young punk, so I was fairly confident that I would enjoy this trip.  I had an episode in my life where anxiety was a problem, but I developed a very strong will and decided that I was strong-willed, or at least strong enough to go through this.



Earlier in the day, but not by more than 2-3 hours, I had drunk about 6 cups of coffee and I was hyper. This effect, I believe, helped me to stay awake during this experience. The day before, I had smoked some Merlin's Blend smoking herbs (bullshit for effects but only \$10/oz) which may or may not have affected my trip.  Also, I put myself in a state of mind where I was totally relaxed, and I think I brought my heart rate down a little bit.  NOTE:  You MUST NOT DO THIS IF YOU HAVE A BAD OR FAST HEART.  With caffeine, ealier that day, my resting pulse rate was 72.  I personally wouldn't do it if my heart rate was 80+ since I believe it can cause irregular heartbeats.



After going to the local supermarket and picking myself up a tube of 12 50mg pills, I brought them into my dorm room and got some of my favorite trippy mellow techno songs going on my mp3 player, as well as a few songs that I felt had `bad vibes' as a little side experiment, basically to see how I would react to it.  I had my big TV hooked up to my PC so that I could just kick back in my easy chair and watch visuals while I tripped away.  At this point, I took 4 of said pills.  About 30 minutes later, I felt the typical dramamine effects, the hapily tired feeling, and the underlying dull headache that can sometimes coccur.  I then took 4 more, waited 5 minutes, took 1 more, bringing me up to 450 mg.



I think the first thing I felt was the heaviness of my body.  Knowing that this drug inhibits acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, I knew that my brain was starting to go into a sort of slow-motion phase.  Walking around became slightly difficult, and coordination was slightly off.  All I knew at that point was that I had to piss and I had to piss BAD.  Luckily the bathroom was just across the hall.  After the little heavy-walking excursion to the John, I went and kicked back, as planned, in my easy chair and turned on some music.  



I turned off the lights, told my roommate what I was doing, and turned on my black light.  I then had a sense of curiosity stronger than ever before.  I wanted to look at everything and see what would happen.  When nothing happened (T: +1 hour) I started to doubt that it would do much more than make me feel heavy.  That's when the `swirlies' and the fabled jellyfish/predator effects kicked in a little.  I was very entertained by these, and I noticed that there was a small bulge at my focal point in my field of vision.  Whenever I stared at something, a little piece of it would disappear, and then everything went slowly black, as if melting.  This effect raised the anxiety level a little but I was awe-struck, so it didn't really matter to me.  I always knew that I was drugged, and kept that in mind.



About 1.5 Hours later, effects were a little bit stronger, but not quite what people said they were.  I took the remaining 3 pills and began to explore the dorm room that I had been a resident in for 4 months.  I looked in the dark corner at my shoes, and saw a crumpled piece of paper on the floor between them.  Eager to read it, I reached down, and lo and behole, the paper vanished.  I laughed at myself for letting a chemical convince me of that.  I looked down again, and this time I saw  ANOTHER shoe between the shoes, looking a little bit different.  I wanted to take a closer look, but again the same results happened.  I was really beginning to appreciate the effects that Dramamine of all things was giving me, in the sense that I had never seen things like this before.



Some unknown amount of time later, I decided to relax my neck and put my head on my arms, and my eyes slowly closed while I stared at my lap.  I looked down THROUGH my eyelids and saw the khakis I was wearing.  I opened my eyes and realized that I was wearing black cargo pants.  All of the time, my roommate was talking to me, I was able to talk back, with the exception of not being able to reply in full sentences.  This drug is so much more destructive to short term memory than any other drug I've tried.  I was trying to tell a joke and messed up about 3 words in, then forgot about what I was talking about.  



At around midnight, I crawled under my covers and tried to sleep.  I think that the combination of caffeine and the psychological processes of my brain on dimenhydrinate kept me up, thinking and thinking and thinking about lots of things until about 2:00 am.  The next morning, I woke up feeling relatively good, no nausea, but a little `changed' in the head, but not permanently or horribly so.



I would say that my trip was a success, even if it was a little intense.  I would not sugest this to the paranoid, the overweight, or the psychotic.  Get a sitter like I did, to give you a sense of security, and DO NOT DRIVE.  Also, the swimmy effect may be too much for some, but it is really neat when EVERYTHING melts into oblivion right before your eyes.  Also be prepared for mis-hearing things in conversations, or conversations that really don't exist.  Video games are a must-have for the trip too, but don't expect to win.



I plan on trying this again in probably 3 to 6 weeks, if I feel up to it.  I wouldn't suggest doing any more than 600 mg if you are 170 lbs.  It is plenty.  If I really do it again, I plan on taking all of it at once, or at least more at first, to see what happens.
