This is my first time using l-methamphetamine. It is found in Vick's inhalers and some similar store brands. I've never tried any form of meth. The L isomer is said by many to be pretty worthless as a recreational drug. Some disagree. It is time for me to find out.



The stimulants I've tried are MDPV, propylhexedrine, modafinil, methylphenidate, ephedra, and one 30mg dose of amphetamine. The only ones I currently have available are modafinil, propylhexedrine, and l-methamphetamine.



I really need something to give me some energy and wake me up. Propylhexedrine can be enjoyable, but is not much good as a functional stimulant. It seems give a pleasant mindfuck sometimes. Modafinil is not strong enough. That leaves l-methamphetamine, which I have never tried before.



For two nights, I had pretty bad insomnia. I slept between 4 and 5 hours last night, and less than two the night before. It is midnight, and I want to get a couple of hours of sleep. I have a calculus test in 8 hours, so I want to be studying by 4:00 AM. I try to sleep, lay awake for over 3 hours before getting up. My mind is foggy and tired. I can't concentrate and can't study in this condition. I have a l-methamphetamine inhaler to use for this situation.



4:00 AM -- I crack the inhaler and eat a little less than half of the cotton from the inhaler, about 20mg of l-methamphetamine. The smell is a bit unpleasant. The taste is a bit bad, but not too bothersome. I also eat some piracetam and choline. I go to the kitchen and grind up some poppies, which I plan to eat shortly.



4:15 AM -- I may be barely feeling it. My mind is still tired and foggy, and I have trouble thinking. I get out my calculus book and notes, getting ready to study for the test.



4:50 AM -- I am feeling it now. My mind is clearer and I have a bit of energy. My mood is a bit brighter. I am able to focus on my calculus now, and I am doing okay at solving the problems. I feel no side effects yet.



5:30 AM -- The effects are still building. I did eat quite a bit about midnight after not eating all day. I also had a bit to eat before eating the cotton. Maybe it is slowing the absorption. I am awake and alert, and feeling a light, gentle euphoria. My studying is going well. I am making good progress on certain things which I did not adequately understand. I just hope I am ready for the test.



6:15 AM -- I eat another 10mg of the l-methamphetamine. The effects of the first dose seem to have peaked. I am wide awake and feeling nice! It is better than I expected. It has definitely been a great tool for this study session. There is no way I would be able to pass the test in the state I was in earlier. I feel no side effects or anxiety.



6:45 AM -- I just finished with my studying and now I take a shower. I have a 42 mile drive to class. The shower seems more invigorating and sensual than usual. Perhaps it is because I am feeling good and awake, instead of the usual tiredness and stress I normally feel in the morning. It just feels really good this morning. I am starting to feel the second dose kicking in. I feel an ever so slight chill run through my body. It is pleasant.



7:10 AM -- It is time to go. I get my stuff together for class, get to my car, and drive off. I am now feeling very alert. I came a bit close to having a crash last night, possibly from the sleep deprivation. I know it seemed harder to drive and I felt like I could just fall asleep at moments. That is not a problem this morning.



I am now feeling a stronger euphoria. I attribute it to the poppies I thought I ate after grinding them earlier. They are actually still in a cup at the head of my bed. Is the l-methamphetamine causing the euphoria on its own, or is it placebo from expecting the poppies to kick in? I don't know. I am feeling quite a bit of tingling feelings and chills running through my body. This is a very pleasant sensation. It is a bit like the feeling I got over my body when I tried MDMA.



8:00 AM -- I am at class, now the test begins. I am still feeling very good, but also anxious over the test. I spend the next 90 minutes solving calculus problems. I did terrible on my last test. I am definitely doing better this time. I think I will end up with a B or a C, not the A I was hoping for. The alertness and mental clarity I got from the l-meth has definitely been a great help though. I am sure I would have gotten an F otherwise.



9:30 AM -- It is wearing off now. Class is over. I still feel pretty good, but the alertness and energy are starting to subside. It doesn't matter now, it has fulfilled its purpose.



10:15 AM -- I am starting to feel tired. I decide to skip my next class. It will not hurt my grade. Now it is time to drive home. I have no trouble with driving home. There is still enough of an effect to keep me from feeling exhausted. The euphoria and pleasant body feelings are gone.



12:00 PM -- I got home a little while ago. The effects have worn off. I decide to go to sleep, and then get up at 3:30PM feeling a bit sick from missing that poppy dose.



In conclusion, I found l-methamphetamine to be a worthwhile and readily obtainable stimulant. For me, it was excellent as a study aid. It probably helped me with driving, considering I was so sleep deprived. I felt no side effects at all from this and would like to try it at a higher dose. I would choose it over any stimulant I have tried, with the exception of amphetamine(adderall). I could see this possibly being just as good as adderall at a higher dose. I've only tried this and Adderall one time each, so it is hard to make a comparison.
