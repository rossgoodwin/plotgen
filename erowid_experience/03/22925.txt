I had just driven 200miles, from Cardiff, UK to Manchester, UK. Along the way, myself and my companions Jon and Sarah smoked around a quarter ounce of top quality skunk, so by the time we got to Manchester we were rather stoned!



Once we arrived in Manchester around 10:30 pm, I parked the car in a dodgy area under some railway bridge, being as stoned as I was, I became rather paranoid about the car, as I had heard many stories about Manchester being a rough place. We went straight into the club, which I was under the impression was alternative metal club, just by the name. 



We were queuing for the club and I noticed the bouncers turning away people that were not dressed in an alternative manner, such as they weren't wearing baggy jeans or they weren't in cyber clothes. This put my mind at ease a little, due to more rumours I had heard about the violence between, the `Trendies' and `Alternatives', but I was still worried about my car.



Once in the club we met up with Oz, one of Jon's friends, also an XTC dealer, who gave us all 2 Mitsu Turbos each. This being the second time I'd dropped, and the club being open till 7am the next morning, I decided that I would take my first now, and the second later in around 3 hours.



I changed my mind; I took it ten minutes later!



I wondered around the club, making sure I had my bearings while I waited to come up, there were three rooms, an industrial room, which was rather small and had all the cyber kids in, a main room which was playing metal at this time, this room had a large variety of people in, and another small room, which was playing classic metal.



Now that I know my way round the club, and still rather stoned and in quite a daze, I decided to just stand in front of the speakers in the industrial room, and watch all the cyber kids play with their glow sticks. I must say, since taking more XTC since, I've noticed one of the best ways to come up is stand in front of the speakers, the vibrations are intense, b4 I come up, and if I'm there as I come up, as that buzz kicks in, when I feel the hairs on my body stand on end, when the spine starts to tingle and spread outwards to the rest of my body, those vibrations from the speakers, is the most intense feeling I will ever have!!



I decide its time to join Oz on the dance floor, I'd only met him once before (the first occasion I took an E) but I saw the grin on his face and I saw his pupils where huge, we stared at each other for a few moments and without saying a word, we both moved in for the hug. Oz and I are both around 6 foot, and rather well built, we both have plenty of strength behind us, this was one of the best feelings in the word, this was a monster hug.



`I parked the car in a dodgy area under some railway bridge', car? What car?



I danced for a while with Oz and then we realised, we hadn't seen Jon in a while, so we both went on search for him, arms over each other's shoulders. We spot Jon on the dance floor with Sarah facing each other, oz goes over behind Jon, Sarah spots Oz, but he signals to her, not to let on Oz's is behind him, I go over behind Sarah, Jon spots me and I signal to him not to let her know I'm behind her. They both comply. And suddenly Oz and I move in, push Jon and Sarah together, and they are now between Oz and I while we make a group hug. This sense of euphoria sent me buzzing again.



Oz and Sarah disappear back into the industrial room, while Jon and I stay in the main room, by this time the music has changed from Metal to Hard House, Jon's pulled open his glow sticks and passed me a set, and we stand entertaining each other with these light shows, trails of light emanating from each others hands, pounding bass we can feel throughout the body, and XTC running through our veins. I can feel everything thing there is around me, I can see more than I've seen before.



As I look around the club, my eyes get easily distracted, by lights, by people I've never met before and people who I already have a bond with, when I see someone I know, I can feel in my entire body how much I love them, but then I realise, its not just them, as I glance over the dance floor again, it's everyone that I love, not just the people I have already bonded with. So, I will happily start a conversation with anyone, sometimes, it doesn't go well, but it doesn't matter, it hasn't upset me, nothing bad has happened, I just move on.



I lose my inhibitions, and will happily talk about any random bollox, to any random person.



By now it's around 3am, the effects of the drugs are starting to wear off, and its clearly visible, I start to wish I didn't take my second pill, and that the coming down phase would stay away for just a few more hours. I find somewhere to sit and relax for a bit. I'm still enjoying myself, I'm now just watching all these people, who are blatantly still off their tits, and loving.



Suddenly, someone's sat next to me and hugging me, I turn to find Oz sat there. He asks me `YouAlright?! YouComingDown?!' I respond with a simple nod, so unexpectedly, he slips another pill into my hand, and offers me his water and chewing gum (much needed clubbing accessories). I drop and stay where I am for a bit, and Oz just states, `I'll be back in a bit!' about 20mins later it happening all over again. The buzz, the hairs, and suddenly the Happy Hardcore. My absolute favourite type of music, I'm up, and I'm staying up, I grab my glow sticks, and I'm on the stage, and I'm dancing, and I'm dancing, I look to my right, and there's a very good looking girl there dancing, and the same on my left, and a room full of ravers staring at me, but this isn't a problem, I'm not shy, I'm not embarrassed, but also I'm not egotistical about it, I just want to please them, give them the light show with the glow sticks they want to see, so I go for it, I've got a girl on either side and me centre stage, and I just feel amazing, people keep handing me water, and stopping me for a second to hug me, but I carry on dancing.



The happy hardcore comes to close and I leave the stage in search for my companions, but I can't find them, I'm not panicked by this, I just find someone else to talk to, share anything with. I find a cute girl who I go up to and offer some chewing gum too, she gives me a huge hug for this and offers me a menthol cigarette. I'm a heavy smoker and I usually smoke around 20-30 ciggs a day, I hadn't smoked one all night. A smoke has never ever been so nice. I can't describe it. Rather than my lungs being filled with, the sweaty, smoke machine filled air, there is a fresh minty, nicotine filled smoke in my lungs, and it was refreshing and incredible. So I start talking to this girl, and we talk about anything and everything, and one things leads to another, and we end up kissing. OMG, it just keeps getting better, she starts playing with the sides of my head (I have a mo hawk, and the sides of my head had been growing for a little over a week). Like I said it keeps getting better, if she'd kept doing this to my head, I'm sure I would have cum. 



Eventually Oz comes over to me once again, and tells me we have to leave, it's around 5am, but he has to be on a bus to London at 7am, so he needs to get home, but first he takes us to Spike's flat. None of us knew who spike was, and he wasn't there, but Oz had a key and let us in. made us a cup of tea and left us to it, after we had a huge hug, and made a pact that we must all get together at least once a month and do this again. 



So now Jon, Sarah and myself are sat in someone's flat that we don't know, and who isn't here and doesn't know us. An interesting situation, but we forgot about this soon enough and started smoking more of our skunk. It was time for us to start coming down properly. No one could skin up, I had a go, and after a couple of tries I managed to make a spliff, and another, and another, and another, I couldn't stop, within an hour we'd smoked another quarter of skunk, and just as I got to rolling the last spliff, Spike came home with a load of people, including his girl friend\ldots  the girl I had got a bit intimate with in the club, again not a good situation. But again it didn't matter, it wasn't brought up, I wasn't jealous, she didn't seem embarrassed, so it was just left. I finish making the last spliff, spark it up, have a blast and pass it to spike, then get up and make another round of tea for everyone who has just arrived. I come back and I around 5 people attempting to skin up, about 3 people crushing pills and another 3 people cutting up lines of speed. 



The people skinning up couldn't manage to do it either, so I offer to complete the tasks for them, they were relieved to have someone else do it, eventually, all the weed was given to me, and I was just the guy skinning up, constantly, and I loved it, every minute of it, I just kept going, and everyone was happy with that.



Eventually, Spike called me over to the table, and I wondered over taking my skinning up tray with me, as I sat down he put a fat line in front of me, it was around 30cms long, and about 1cm wide. I said `What is it?' he replied with, `well there's some speed in there, there's some doves, and some mistus.' I took the 20 note off him and snorted it all up. 



There is now a gap in my memory, I know at some point, Jon and Sarah went to Afflecks Place, and alternative shopping mall, and I stayed with Spike and took more drugs.



The next thing I do remember is on the train to Chester to see Jon's parents, Jon and Sarah were about ready to pass out, and were worried about missing the train stop, `I've taken so much speed I'll be awake for days' I said. The next thing I remember is Jon waking me up at Chester Train Station.



I don't know what it is about speed, and me but it just makes me tired. No one I know can explain it, it just makes me tired, I've taken speed three times in my life, and every time, after a while, I just pass out.



Eventually we get to Jon's parents house, we say Hi to everyone, I try and act like I'm not off my tits, unknown to me until we arrived in Chester, Jon's mother is Doctor, and his father is a Police officer. However, I don't quite manage to act sober, and for some reason I decided to cook, everyone always tells me about `Gut Rott' on a come down, I could eat anything on a come down. So I made an Omelette, I don't think I've ever whisked eggs so fast in my life. 



Now we are drawing near to the end of my tale, and I've asked myself this question, many times. Looking back, I took a lot of drugs for, in my opinion, a heavy drug user, this was my second time taking pills, and my first time taking speed. I would guess, in total, I took around 6 or 7 pills, snorted around 3 or 4 pills in total with around a gram of speed and smoked over an ounce of various cannabis. 



So I have to ask\ldots 

  Is there such as thing as too many drugs?



Don't take this as an excuse to go out and force as many drugs down your throat as you can, I look back and think I was so stupid to do what I did, I'm lucky I was with experienced drug users who were happy to look after me in the state I was in, Spike and Hendy (Spikes Flat Mate) told me when to drink, when to piss, and made sure I was ok at all times.
