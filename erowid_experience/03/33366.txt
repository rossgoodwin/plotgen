[Erowid Note: This report is marked as a methcathinone report, but readers should be aware there are aspects of it that suggest the identification is speculative.] 





When I first encountered methcathinone (erroneously called ice by the mentally imperfect oaf (read idiot) who had been using it for at least 6-8 months), I had never heard of it before.





It was christmas eve of 2003, and my boyfriend of 9 years and I decided to visit some friends we hadn't seen in a while. When the door opened, I was amazed to recognize our previously 250+ pound friend (I'll call him Omadawn), looking as though he now weighed less than me (as it turned out, he did). Naturally, we questioned him as to what had brought about this miraculous transformation, and he claimed it was due to his prescription of Oxycontin, which, it turned out, he was crushing and snorting massive amounts of (he'd go through a month's prescription in less than a week).





Early in the conversation, I suddenly noticed Omadawn's roommate (lets call him Wyrm) appeared to be sucking on a smoking lightbulb. Needless to say, I found that to be a rather odd activity, and questioned him on it. All three guys immediately began to elucidate the attributes of this `ice' (apparently my boyfriend had done it with them in the past). They asked me if I would like to try it, and, willing to try most anything once, I agreed. As I was unfamiliar with both the substance and method of intake, I simply held the straw while they competed in being the best at holding a lighter under a lightbulb.





The effects were almost instantaneous. My mind felt sharpened, and I quickly became engaged in animated conversation. The euphoria I can only describe as feeling `sparkly', like I had stars in my eyes. I was wide awake, but I did not feel the need to be physically active. I was quite content to sit there and ponder the superior qualities of Linux as opposed to Windows (both my boyfriend and Wyrm are genius uber-geeks) as they were eagerly explained to me.





The bulb was passed around almost continually, and it seemed we covered every topic from reincarnation to Tessla's inventions to the best way to go about becoming an assassin. I felt hardly any physical effects, except for a complete lack of hunger, and feeling pleasantly languid. It was around 10 in the morning when I realized that I had not smoked one cigarette since we had arrived, and did not feel any need to.





We left around noon to go to my parents' house for christmas celebrations, and I found to my pleasant surprise that I was still not feeling a bit of hunger, and was able to easily refrain from eating my normally huge portions. This was so unusual for me, that my mother even asked if I was feeling ok. I replied that I was thinking about going on a diet (something I wouldn't previously have even considered), and they were dumbstruck. Naturally, they showered me with encouragements, and began giving me tips and advice on how to `stick with it'. It was rather amusing. My father even offered to buy me a new car if I were to be successful (although I took this with a grain of salt). Normally, I probably would have been a bit offended at this obvious confirmation of my ample size and apparent lack of willpower, but right then I was feeling quite sanguine and forgave them their unconsidered but well-meaning patronization.





By 4pm, I was starting to lose the edge and was feeling a bit drowsy. By the time we got home around 7 or 8, I was ready to go to bed. I slept like a log, and awoke around 11am feeling like I'd had the best sleep of my life. I inquired about obtaining more of this substance, and found that it was Wyrm who could supply it. At 5'3', my `optimal' body weight is quoted as being 111 to 124 lbs. I decided I would be happy if I got close to 125 lbs. That meant I would have to lose 50 lbs. I have quite a few factors against me, including having been pregnant twice, side effects from my birth control implants (NORPLANT), and working from home, but my biggest difficulty was and always has been my love of food. It's almost like I'm addicted to eating. I have absolutely no control, and will be wanting to eat even when I am full. I have never found any other diet or plan that was not practically torture for me, and none of the `diet supplements' I tried put a dent in my cravings. Fortunately or unfortunately (however you want to look at it), my body decided to settle at 175 lbs, and no matter how much I consumed, it wouldn't fluctuate more than a few pounds. I was afraid that even if I did lose the weight, it would come right back, and I certainly didn't want to be dependent on an illegal drug for the rest of my life.





I decided to give it a try anyway, hoping that it would still have the same effect it had the first time. Wyrm clarified that Omadawn wasn't the brightest bulb in the pack (pardon the pun), and can't tell the difference between ice, crank, meth or cat, the latter being what we were actually imbibing. To my consternation, he informed me that in our area the stimulant was almost unknown, and due to the difficulty involved in getting it, was rather costly. After some thought, I decided to go ahead and arranged for 1/2 a gram.





As it turns out, the effect I was looking for can be achieved with much less than we had taken in that night, and as the other effects are just bonuses to me, 1/2 a gram can last me a week($\sim$10mg - 200mg at a time), if I take it only when I start to feel hungry. *If* being the operative word.





Cat enables me to stay awake for days at a time, and that in itself can be addicting, as I've always thought sleep was a waste of time. I have a very hard time saving it only for when I start to crave something with a lot of calories. The euphoria is very enjoyable as well, although a tolerance is very quickly built up, especially if it is taken on a regular basis. The upswing to that is that the tolerance also disappears just as quickly once I discontinue use. I've also not had a repeat of that unusual lack of wanting a cigarette that I experienced that first time.





I regulated my appetite with cat for approximately 3 weeks. I lost 20 lbs, and was estatic at my progress. Then the local supply ran out. I had been taking it on a pretty regular basis, and experienced a few mild withdrawal symptoms, mainly a bit of anxiety and some irritability, not even as bad as PMS can get sometimes. It only lasted a day or two. But then I started to eat again. My appetite was back with the same ferocity as before. I just knew I'd gain all the weight back, and all the money I had spent would come to naught. Sure enough, I put on 2 lbs by the second day. By the end of the week I was back up to 165. Feeling a little depressed about the fruitlessness of my attempt, I avoided the scales. 





5 weeks later, Wyrm advised me the supply had been reestablished. I didn't see much point in spending that much money for that particular reason, but my boyfriend decided he wanted some, and I decided to go ahead and get a bit for the weekend. Imagine my shock when, out of curiosity and a little masochism perhaps, I stepped back on the scales that night, and they reported 164! I had been consuming up to 5000 calories a day, sometimes even more, for over a month, and I had not returned to my previous seemingly arbitrary 175. Evidently my body's metabolism had been accelerated somehow by my 3 week `cat fast', and it had stabilized there.





I've gone back to my previous regimen, and as of this morning, weigh in at 145. The supply is fickle, and every time it runs out, my robust appetite returns, and I gain weight, but it is usually only around 5 - 10 lbs before it once again stablilizes, always a little lower than before. I have had decreasing withdrawal symptoms each time, usually just an `out of sorts' feeling the day after the last hit, and I didn't even notice them this last time.





I'll be glad when I reach my goal of 125 lbs. for good. This has been a very expensive experience, but it was worth it to me. My parents are leaving on a 2 month trip in a couple of weeks, and I will not let them see me until they are back. I've told them my work has picked up and is keeping me busy. I can't wait to see their expressions, and I'm holding my dad to that promise.





All in all, it has been an amazing year so far, and I couldn't have experienced it without methcathinone. I do not believe it deserves to be a Schedule 1 drug, and hope that someday someone researches this drug, for I believe it could do much, not to mention make some pharmaceutical company very rich. The government has been looking for a drug that `enables soldiers in the field to opperate without food or sleep for long periods of time'. Well, there you go. Have some cat.
