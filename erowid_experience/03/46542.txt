It was the night before homecoming and my buddy and I knew that we had a good chance at getting hooked up with some grass at our homecoming football game. We did and I was pleased to only be paying 25 for an eighth. I trusted my friend who gave it to us and we and I went home to dig into the newly bought herb. I rolled two joints, fairly decent sized and we went out back to light them up. This was almost exactly at 10 o clock.



I was under the assumption that this stuff wouldn't be to heavy and that we'd just get a little buzzed, nothing to serious. And about half way thru the jay that assumption was holding up. As I finished it off I saw the lights in my house sort of swaying and moving, more like being drunk than anything else. My friend said nothing to heavy was hitting him. We swaggered up to the house and tried to get everything in order for the night- pillows, blankets, movies. After arranging everything in the basement I went to start up a movie, `The Doors'.



As I stood there waiting for the black screen to turn into the DVD menu I watched my feet. To my surprise they were getting farther away, like I was floating up from them. I tried to move them but they wouldn't go anywhere. Suddenly I recognized that I had no body- I did not exist physically. I felt no heartbeat and I began to float around the room, like a ball of consciousness. I don't remember breathing either, I was just there. Things were happening upstairs, people talking and such and when I tried to turn my head to get a better position to hear, I couldn't move it. I was totally out of my body. Then I heard my friend coming downstairs and I thought `god, he'll come down and I'll be totally out of my body.' I thought maybe I had died and that I was stuck now for eternity as a floating field of consciousness. It terrified me. I tried hard to remember what it felt like to `be', to have some physical form. Suddenly I was back inside myself and I could feel my body working and moving. It was then that I realized I was in for a night of insanity. 



Somewhere along the line I found myself on the floor, staring up at my basement ceiling, `The Doors' playing in the background. The colors began to change and my AC vent became a TV. The tiles on my ceiling whipped through it, like I was watching a movie. I snapped myself out of this hallucination and tried to tell myself there was reality, that this COULD NOT happen unless I was on something. Moments later I found I was outside of my body again. My spirit floated up through the basement and up through the roof of my house until I was in space, flying around in the universe. Then stars started to come together and twinkle in multi-colored phases, they were forming a figure, a face. The face I believe to be Jesus or Socrates, I'm not really sure. It was like looking at a light-bright picture of a man with long hair and a beard. We had nothing to say to each other, as if we both knew everything the other did, and I remember being swallowed by this face in the stars. As soon as that happened I was back on earth, in my body, watching `The Doors'. 



This whole time I was never aware of my friend next to me until I saw him out of the corner of my eye. I watched him roll across the floor, away from me and I was terrified when I noticed that only the lower half of his body had rolled away. His torso, head and all, was still sitting there, watching the movie. I could hear the separation- the popping and splitting. I was not sure what to do so I left him there and I looked back at my ceiling. There's a big black spot now and I don't remember much, but I recall looking at the ceiling and seeing Elton John up there. He was playing `Tiny Dancer' (one of my favorite songs) and he was using my AC vent as a piano. I rolled over because I really couldn't handle seeing Elton John on my ceiling. 



The next thing I recall was hearing the music from the movie and seeing the things in my basement turn into dancers in a musical. Books moved like fans and the AC vent magnified and turned into a giant cage and sun around me. All of this was very dream like, not real at all. Here there is another blackout moment. The next thing I remember was either dreaming or, possibly having yet another OBE, I'm not sure. I was floating around in an airport somewhere and it was totally empty. But as I looked on down the hallway I could see a man walking away from me. At first I thought it was myself because he had the same build and look, ``feel'' even to him. But I knew it wasn't me, something told me it just was not me.



Then, a voice out of nowhere told me ``That's my father''. I am adopted and I've never even seen my real parents, I have no idea what they look like. But I KNEW this man was my father, somehow. So I followed him trying to catch up but he never got any closer, every now and then looking back over his shoulder. I couldn't make out his face but I recall he had a beard. That experience was one of the most terrifying and shocking I've ever had. I also recall motion being slowed down so much that I could feel my body working on an atomic level. When I touched my tongue to the roof of my mouth (which I was doing a lot because of the cotton mouth) I could feel every molecule of my tongue embracing the roof of my mouth. When I thought about the sensation of breathing I could see oxygen coming into my lungs and being changed into carbon dioxide. When I thought about breathing even more I realized how fantastic it was to be able to breath. Every breath I was taking was magnificent and I felt privileged to be alive and experiencing such a glorious sensation. 



After that I fell asleep, I don't remember much of anything else. Maybe some general hallucinations here and there, but no more OBE's or celebrities appearing on my ceiling. As soon as this trip started I knew something was in that stuff, what it was I couldn't say.

I've vowed never to use PCP but I think perhaps it was dipped in some LSD and then dried. The closest trip like that I've had was on DXM. Overall it wasn't a bad trip, parts were terrifying but I lived through it and, when I woke up the next day, everything looked so beautiful. Like every breath I took was a gift, I really enjoyed life and wanted to be alive. I know I won't be smoking any of that stuff soon but the next time I'm going to try to have an even better experience. I use drugs for spiritual enlightenment. The trip I had that night before homecoming was enlightening and, although I still remember what it feels like to be dead (at least I think so) I wouldn't trade the experience for anything.
