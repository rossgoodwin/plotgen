Twenty-four milligrams of N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine hcl



MiPT intrigued me when I first read of it in TIHKAL.  From a chemical standpoint, it is similar to DMT and DiPT.  The structure of MiPT has one isopropyl group on a DMT backbone where DiPT has two\ldots   Both DMT and DiPT are fantastic and incredible entheogens.  Especially DiPT.  From a psychological standpoint of view, MiPT was said to `emphasize 'psychedelic' effects over `hallucinogenic' effects.'  Perhaps it was a tryptamine `version' of MDMA in that it was a compound which opens one up without getting in the way of anything?  Only one way to find out?try it!  Twenty-four milligrams was the dose I selected.



I had planned to try it with my friend M. but our plans kept falling through each time.  So on the third day of things getting canceled I decided to just go out and sample it on my own.  But I wasn't completely sure if I really wanted to do it though because I was by myself, it was my first time with this compound, and I am not as comfortable with tryptamine psychedelics as I am with the phenethylamines.  So I just decided to hike up to my favorite tripping spot (so far), the Red Rocks at top of Settlers Peak, and see how I felt about things when I got to the top.



This is the place where I had taken 2C-C previously.  I made a \href{http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=25426}{report} of that experience.  Anyway, I packed my backpack with all the necessities (pot, CDs, CD player, apples, bananas, nitrous oxide, and lots of Gatorade.)  I said goodbye to my birds and made my way out.  Adventure awaited me!



The sky was strongly overcast and rain was predicted, but I did not care.  There are lots of crevices on the mountain for one to seek refuge.  When I got to the top it almost immediately started to drizzle but I was not bothered.  I quickly found a spot that sheltered me from the moisture and I was happy.  I felt that everything was in its right place.



But I still was not sure if I wanted to take the compound or not.  I asked myself why I was tripping.  Was it that I was just curious as to what MiPT did, or did I actually want/need another entheogenic experience at this time?  I thought about things for a few minutes, and then decided to take a balloon of nitrous oxide and make my decision after that.



I got out my gear and filled up the balloon with the dissociating gas.  I pressed play on my CD player and Dylan sang \emph{Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands} for me.  Perhaps it was the altitude, but that balloon blew me away hard!  Normally I find nitrous oxide to be uninteresting if I don't take it with a psychedelic or ketamine.



This time though it was almost 5-MeO-DMT-like in its intensity.  And when I came back, there were the beautiful Rocky Mountains all around me!  The sun came out for a bit and it was gorgeous.  I immediately got out the capsule of MiPT and swallowed it with a swig of Gatorade.  No turning back now.  To pass the time while waiting for the material to take effect, I listened to my favorite Pink Floyd album; `Meddle.'



I started to notice some effects within twenty minutes or so.  After the initial alert, I felt a strong intensification of the music.  Each instrument and note I heard was very clear and well defined.  There was also an intensified emotional connection to the songs.  No closed-eyed or open-eyed visuals however were present, but when the record was over I did begin to notice some mild trails when I moved my hands around.



Nothing in my immediate view appeared to change form, nor were there any movement/melting of objects, and no pretty colors dancing around.  But objects did seem to `jump about' a bit in my peripheral vision.  I also began to notice a warm tryptamine body-buzz.  The come-on was very gentle and there were no negative side-effects or nausea to content with.  Always a plus.



Perhaps one hour after I ate the capsule, I decided to smoke some marijuana.  Within ten minutes or so after taking the pot, the effects really began to grow.  But it was for the most part a mental trip.  I truly felt my mind `expanded' and opened up, and I was pondering about things on much deeper level than normal.  But there were still no sensory changes save for the mild trailing and the `jumping about' of objects out of the corner of my eye.



I then decided to put on the Beatles `Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.'  What an album!  Every note sounded so perfect and in its right place.  Interestingly enough, even though the sound of the music was strongly intensified, there were still no closed-eyed visuals produced from listening to the music.  I did not see anything with eyes shut beyond normal.  It was very strange considering how hard I felt I was tripping in my head.  It was almost mushroom-like but with no visuals.  At least MiPT was not a sensory psychedelic for me.



At the height of the experience, I reached a very mild and controllable plus-three.  I stayed on the rocks for good four-hours or so, listening to the Beatles and Pink Floyd.  I also enjoyed a balloon more of nitrous oxide.  With the balloon my ego was propelled out of this dimension and into sheer nothingness.  And coming back from the breath of the gas was the best part.  It was like being reborn in the best of scenery possible, the beautiful Colorado Rocky Mountains!  Gosh I am thankful that they are literally my backyard!



But when darkness began to move in, I decided to make my way down the mountain and wound up at my Friend D's apartment.  This was around the five-hour mark of the trip and the effects were definitely dying down.  I would say at this point I was at a mild plus-two.  Now the effects consisted of objects being much brighter than normal, especially lights, mild trails on moving objects, halos around bright items and the feeling of heightened intellectual aptitude.  In some ways, this felt like a `smart psychedelic.'  But it wasn't at the same intensity as it was a few hours earlier.



Then I went into D's bedroom alone and have one more balloon of nitrous oxide.  I played song three on Pink Floyd's `Meddle', a song called \emph{Fearless}.  That was the most powerful nitrous experience of the night.  I was gone for well over a minute and experienced complete ego loss for most of that time.  I came out of D's room and greeted him and his friend Cy with a big smile.  That was a beautiful experience.  It also seemed to bring the effects of the MiPT back up a bit.



The time eventually came however when D and Cy needed to go to bed, so I went to my friend K's house and joined the crowd that was there.  It was K and two acquaintances of his.  This became a time of learning for me.  I am very fond of K as a friend, but I do not approve of his lifestyle.  He is on disability but has no real reason not to work.  He does have back injuries, but there are `sit-down' jobs where all you have to do is work on the computer.  Since he sits on his couch all day at the taxpayer's expense I see no reason he would not be capable of work where no physical labor was involved.  He is capable.  An acquaintance of his, named C was also there.  C is a homeless alcoholic man that `dumpster dives' and I believe steals as well.  He possesses items that he claims to find in the trash that people just don't throw away, like fully functional lap-top computers.



While I am fond of both men, and I don't consider myself judgmental of them (I am just realistic), just listening to their conversations about their lives made me realize how lucky I am.  In three of four years from now I will have a master's degree and will be a fully licensed psychotherapist.  I know I have a future ahead of me and I am going places.  This made me very happy about myself, a feeling I find hard to come by these days.  I know I have a gifted future ahead of me and I am so thankful for the fact that I am getting an education and that I know what I want to do with my life.  I will never have to `dumpster dive.'  I suddenly felt very proud of myself and my accomplishments.



Around seven hours into the experience, I was mostly down from the trip.  There was some jaw tension and a little bit of a residual `wired' feeling from the MiPT so I took a small amount of oxycodone and valium to relax.  Within an hour or so I was asleep.  I awoke the next day feeling refreshed and at peace with myself.  Once again I thanked the universe for a positive experience and enjoyed the rest of the day relaxing.



\emph{Conclusion:}



While I found no particular negative aspects with MiPT, I was not overly impressed with it at all.  It was definitely psychedelic, but I had no life-changing revelations.  There were no moments of profound spiritual connections or anything of that nature.  Not that I expect life-changing revelations on every trip I take, this material just didn't seem to have the push to even have much potential of producing it.  At least at the dosage I took.  And there were no sensory joys to marvel at.  It was basically a nice mild trip that (as reported) emphasized the intellectual component of a psychedelic over the visual properties.  It seemed more suited for social or intellectual interactions, perhaps at a lower dosage.  There was this `smart drug' feeling to it.  Now whether my experience was biased by my readings, I do not know.  But my experience was very similar to what was reported in TIHKAL.



I have no particularly strong desire to experiment with MiPT again, except perhaps as a chemical to mix with MDMA.  I would take the MiPT first and then dose the MDMA when I began to feel the tryptamine take effect.  I could see that being a nice combination, but then again I can also think of other tryptamines I'd rather mix with MDMA.  So why waste the time?  MiPT is a nice material but it really does not excite me enough to want to take it again.  There are many more interesting compounds to experiment with.
