Well, I had some fentanyl patches from the Summer, at which time I enjoyed eating drops of the gell and getting a nice opiate high. Well for some weird reason, I saved the empty patches.



I had always heard of people chewing on bits of the empty patches to catch a buzz, but I hadn't discovered this untill far after I had already consumed all the gell inside. I guess I thought that it would have dried up and become useless, so I just let them sit around.



This was untill one night (two days ago) I was out of weed, and I really wanted to get high. I didn't know the dose for empty patches, but because they had been sitting around for so long I chewed on all 4 that I had, for about 20 minutes. I really didn't expect and effects, well whoops! I was wrong.



Almost immidiately after taking the patches out of my mouth, I was starting to feel it. The traditional fentanyl feeling. A nice warmth, euphoria, and content feeling. I decided to sit in my room and enjoy it, while drinking some grapefruit juice.



All of a sudden I became rather dehydrated. This was maybe 10 minutes after I finished chewing the patches. I pulled out some grapefruit juice, due to the fact that I've heard it increases the effects of opiates. I'm not sure if this is true or not, due to the fact that I've done it pretty much every time I've done an opiate. Little did I know, the effects did not need to be intesified at all.



So maybe 10 minutes later I started to feel sick. It was a general uneasy feeling, but due to the fact that the euphoria was stronger than ever, I really didn't care.



I had quickly guzzled down my drink, so decided to get another. As I got up from my bed I got a strong feeling to puke. So I went into the bathroom and had a nice barf. Usually throwing up is quite unpleasent for me, but at this point I didn't seem to care. I was quite sure I was overdosing, but I was still content and mellow. I seemed to have the attitude that it was too late, if I was going to die I was gonna die, nothing I could do now.



I told my parents I was sick (I really didn't feel like going to the hosipital), and after puking and getting another drink, I went back to bed. 



Normally with fentanyl I feel really relaxed and chilled, to the point where I just like to sit in bed and listen to the weird voices that I always here when I'm on it. But for some reason, in this overintoxicated state, I was unable to simply lie in bed. I was also filled with a sense of lonelyness, so I decided to go talk with my parents.



`What an idiot!!' you may be saying, but luckily I'm always in control in a drugged up state\ldots well for the most part. Plus the fact that my parents thought I was sick, would be a security blanket just in case they thought I was acting weird.



So after talking with them for a while, and going to puke on occasion, I got the huge urge to sleep, and went back to bed. I was hit with the regular voices that I always hear when I'm falling asleep on the stuff, except they were a lot more intense. I began to go into a half-dream state, where I'd act out certain daily tasks, like walking to school or something, and then going `wait\ldots I'm in bed trying to sleep'.



I then realized I was probably going to die in my sleep, and I'm pretty sure this was the last coherent thought I had before passing out. Luckily I had set my alarm for 10:30 (it was about 9:00 at this point), just incase.



For some strange reason I woke up at 10:00, which is weird because usually I fall into a really deep sleep with this stuff, but not this time. The second I got out of bed I felt the urge to puke again, so I proceeded to do so.



Then I got itchy, like I often did when I did high enough doses. Except usually it was a nice itch, this time it was just too much. I was scratching constantly, and couldn't help it. It was rather uncomfterable, and if it weren't for the glowing warmth and euphoria I was still blanketed in, I probably would have been rather upset about it.



Anyhow, after conversing about random things some more with my parents, I got extremely tired again, accepted the fact that I was probably going to die, and went to bed.



The next morning I woke up not too happy to be alive. The sickness from the night before was still with me rather strong, but the euphoria and warmth were both gone.



I was sick untill about 2:00 in the afternoon, and after that it was still lingering a bit but it wasn't as bad. Now, two days after the experience, I'm pretty much recovered.



I'd like to add that I have a rather large tolerance for opiates, due to the fact that I used fentanyl almost daily for 3 weeks, and have had occasional opiate use since then. So what this means is that there's a good chance that 4 empty patches could be enough to kill someone with no tolerance, as I'm pretty sure I came rather close to it that night.



Overall, this experience wasn't too bad, to be honest I don't even regret it. I got nice and high for free, got to miss school, and now I can say I've OD'd\ldots yay. The highness easily overrided the sickness, the only time it really sucked was the day after. But either way, I could have died, so I wouldn't do it again.
