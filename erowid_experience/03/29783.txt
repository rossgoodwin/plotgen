First of all, I have to admit that my drug experience is rather limited. Moderate E use, some amanitas, alcohol, morning glory seeds (once), weed (about 3 times total), and DXM (twice, and I'm not a big fan) are all I've done, so my experience with 4-AcO-DiPT was viewed within the frame of reference provided by those substances. As soon as I read the experience reports (of which there are few), I was very interested in trying it. I described the reported effects to my girlfriend ('J'), who is a much more experienced drug user than I. She was also enthusiastic about trying it, so we ordered 500mg from an online vendor.



Around 8:30 p.m. on Jan. 2, we measured two doses of 20mg apiece in the kitchen of my apartment. We were both in a good mood, and we were a filled with a certain amount of anticipation and excitement about trying something new and different. We had both eaten a full meal at about 6 p.m. (probably not a good idea for J, in retrospect). I was a little tired and mentally dull, having worked a 10 hour day which started at 6 a.m. while still fighting the effects of holiday partying. I put my serving in a small glass of Sprite (it dissolved very quickly), and down the hatch it went. J took hers about 5 minutes later.



My only mistake of the evening was allowing the white powdery substance to touch any part of my mouth. Take it from me, a guy who can chew E pills like they're peanuts: this stuff tastes really, really disgusting. If you think E is bitter, multiply that times 10 and you'll have an idea of what I mean. Yuck!  



About 10 minutes had passed since I took my dose, so I decided to take a shower. Around that time I started to get a bit of a light, floaty feeling. Maybe a placebo effect, maybe not. 10 minutes later, while I was in the shower, I started to feel a slight tingly sensation in my legs. This eventually upgraded to a feeling of tiny nerve twitches throughout my legs, which I figured had to be the `jelly legs' effect that others have described. I felt a tad bit unsteady on my feet, but it was controllable. (This went away after about 30-40 minutes.) I felt a tingly sensation in my skin, especially when the hot water hit my scalp. Very pleasant. I also noticed things starting to `sit up and take notice' in the crotch area, if you catch my meaning. Blood flow to the groin seemed to be increased.

A few minutes before I got out of the shower, my girlfriend came in the bathroom. She seemed a bit anxious and kept asking me to get out of the shower. I reassured her that I was fine, but I thought she seemed a bit overly concerned. This was a clue\ldots .



My stomach started to feel a little queasy, so I decided to lie down in bed and stare at the ceiling. My ceiling has these little glow in the dark star stickers all over it. These were applied by the previous tenants and somehow overlooked by the crack team of painters who worked on my apartment prior to my arrival. (When I say `crack team' I really mean `on crack.') I have a big blacklight, and the stars glow brightly when it's on. At this point (about +30 min.) I started to see some visuals: the star stickers looked like they were spinning, and I saw little twinkly lights appear and disappear all over the ceiling. The stereo was playing, but I don't recall experiencing any auditory enhancements. The queasiness stayed for a little while, but it was never very bad and went away when I took some deep breaths. I noticed my pulse was slightly elevated (around 90 bpm or so), and my chest felt a bit tight when I took deep breaths. Nothing to get worked up about though.



Feelings of great happiness started to appear. They were not as intense as the empathic euphoria of MDMA, but very positive nonetheless. At one point I closed my eyes and started to have a vivid dream. It's kind of hard to describe, but I had a vision in which J and I were these snakelike vines which were continuously intertwining around each other. This was happening in a way that was somehow synchronized with the music playing on the stereo. It was a fleeting dream which only lasted a few seconds. It reminded me of the vivid dreams I have at the end of a good MDMA roll, but more bizarre. J later told me she had a short waking dream in which she was a coffee table and her limbs were like folding sections of the tabletop. 

A lot has been said about the tactile enhancements provided by 4-AcO-DiPT. Touching the skin felt very good, but it seemed superficial. It was like the very top layer of skin felt super-sensitive and tingly, but the layers beneath felt normal or even slightly less sensitive. I attributed this to the mild dissociative effects I experienced with this substance. 



By now J complained of nausea, and she seemed uncomfortable. She went into the bathroom to vomit, after which she felt better. Of course, now I'm thinking `All right, she's done throwing up\ldots let's have sex!!!'  I'll try to describe this without sounding like a Penthouse Forum letter:



This drug was VERY interesting, from a sexual standpoint. To say it made me horny would not really describe it accurately. Once we started to have sex, it was as if a switch was flipped in my brain. All I thought about was the act of having intercourse, right here, right now. It was not a loving, passionate feeling, like sex on MDMA; it was more like some sort of reptilian impulse, like all the other parts of my brain were turned off. I looked down at J, and everything underneath her seemed to be tranparent (the white sheets were illuminated by the blacklight). When I came, it was definitely the most intense orgasm I've ever had. An MDMA-enhance orgasm is amazing when I can pull it off, but this one really `went to 11', so to speak. J confirmed this. She described her orgasm (which came pretty quickly) as being very long and intense. She also said that while we had sex, she actually felt like we had started to float above the bed. The experience was excellent, and actually exceeded our expectations. 



Unfortunately, things went downhill from there. J felt a little nauseous again, and she seemed to be having some moderate feelings of anxiety. She said she felt like things `weren't right', and she wanted to know how long the effects were supposed to last. She asked me turn turn off the Mazzy Star CD that was playing, and turn on the lights. Although I didn't have any experience with real psychedelics, I realized she was having a bad trip.  So, we went out to the living room, where I turned on the lights and the Christmas tree, and put `The Santa Clause' into the DVD player. (J loves Christmas, and that's one of her favorite holiday movies. I'm more of a `Nightmare Before Christmas' guy myself, but that one seemed like a bad idea.) She seemed much more at ease as we watched the movie. J then disclosed that while she had done acid on numerous occasions, she usually didn't enjoy it and spent most of her trip wishing it was over. With 4-AcO-DiPT she was expecting a drug that was very sensual and euphoric, and was rather upset when the effects reminded her more of an acid trip than an E roll.



`The Santa Clause' movie was actually pretty fun to watch while tripping. All those crazy elves running around, the fairy-tale look of the North Pole, super-intelligent reindeer, Tim Allen turning into a fat old man\ldots .all these things seemed extremely interesting and funny. As I lay on the couch I looked over at my Christmas tree. Its branches appeared to be undulating, which I thought looked very cool. For some reason I decided I wanted to eat, so I went to the fridge and took out a bowl of a brown rice dish I had made. The rice was undulating too, so I decided to just have a few tortilla chips. They were fine, and the salt tasted good. Chewing felt pretty weird, in a dissociative kind of way. It was like the chewing was going on in a place that was much further away from my brain than usual. 



I went back to the couch and resumed watching the movie. I actually felt a little sleepy and almost dozed off a couple times.  By the time the movie ended it was around 11:30, and most of the effects were gone. We went to bed, but J had trouble sleeping in spite of taking a 5-HTP capsule, a melatonin tablet, and an over-the-counter sleeping pill. I slept for about 6 hours, but I felt very sharp and refreshed the next day. The grogginess of the past couple days was gone, I was in a good mood, and there were no hangover effects. All in all, I thought this substance was easy on the body. My lower back was a little tight from muscle tension that occurred during the trip, but a little stretching took care of that.



I'm looking forward to trying this again, and I think I'll `kick it up a notch' to 25mg next time. J even wants to try it again; she says she will enjoy it more now that she knows what to expect.
