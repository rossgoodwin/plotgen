Quick note:  I am a large-built guy, so please keep that in mind with dosage.  I have a history of needing more medicine than most people to get the same effect.  So while the dosages I've consumed may not seem like much, still, when done together, I think it's a good idea not to let any one med overwhelm you, and to not get impatient if you pop a pill and don't feel something right away.  Instead, take them about an hour or so before you want to start buzzing.  I'm in a very `experiment-oriented' stage right now in my use of mind-altering substances.  As I get to know more about these diverse chemicals, I plan to do whatever I can that is safe, yet effective, to put me in the space I want to be in.  The combination of chemicals utilized by me yesterday turned out to produce very `nice' results.



Notes for how I prepare for this kind of trip:  Music or no, it's up to you; I keep a pen \& paper handy for recording high observations.  For some visual fun, an area with plenty of uniform textures.  For instance, the floor can be a marble pattern, the ceiling can be grainy \& white, the walls can be plain white\ldots   These seem to be the best kinds of surfaces for pulling a hallucination out of.  As for a sitter, I didn't have one and during this entire trip, I felt pretty much `together'.  But I don't tend to `go off' during trips, even pot or LSD.



Initiated launch: 3:00 P.M. EST



Brand names used:

DXM: Vicks 44 Cough Relief (no extra ingredients I don't need);

Dimenhydrinate:  Dramamine Chewable Formula 50 mg tablets;

Diphenhydramine:  Unisom SleepGels, 50 mg each.



That said, the Dramamine (dimenhydrinate, which I'll refer to as DMH from here-on in, and will refer to dypenhydramine as DPH) was almost accidentally included.  I've done DXM a few times before, and didn't like the nausea, so I thought I'd add Dramamine to help reduce those effects.  I had no idea DMH was itself psychoactive.



To prepare for the experience, I actually decided it best to eat a little something, in addition to the DMH.  So I had one of those `Annie's organic burritos', and let it settle a bit.  During this time, I cleared my head of all expectations, deciding that I don't really want to be in control of this trip.  I lucid dream very, VERY frequently, and find sometimes it's more revealing just to let it go where it wants to go instead of where you want it to go.  After my mind was clear, and I had everything where I wanted it to be, I got online to read and began.  (No music, as I'm hearing impaired and didn't want to turn it up loud enough to disturb my friend's neighbors).



0:00 I downed 100 mg DMH first, then about 150 mg DXM.



0:15 No effects yet, as expected. I waited a little to down another 150 mg DMX, trying to spread it out to reduce the nausea factor. During that time, I was right here on Erowid reading trip reports and various other things, when I came across some reports for DMH - Dramamine!  Shocking!  So I read around about that a bit, and once had some idea what a good dosage might be\ldots 



0:25 \ldots I popped another 200 mg DMH and the rest of the DXM (bringing my total to right around 450 mg).  By this time, I had a mild `buzz' feeling, but nothing too heavy just yet.



0:40   I took my last two DMH.  By this time, I wasn't really feeling much of a difference, just a slight tired, airy `comfortable' feeling.  Then I read about diphenhydramine, sleep medicine.  When I found out that, too, was psychoactive, and I knew I had some, I had to add it to my already drug-saturated system.  So, at\ldots 



0:50   \ldots I ingested 200 mg DPH.



This was an experience I wanted to be conscious through, so had I any trouble staying awake, I would have got some coffee.  However, while the DPH and DMH tend to make one sleepy, OD-ing on DMX tends to counter that effect.  At least, it did with me.  So while I had to occasionally resist the pull of sleep, keeping the number of different chemicals in your body to a minimum is very good advice.  Just use what you need to get you where you're going, nothing more.



These three chemicals appear to be in a similar category to each other, so I thought perhaps they would harmonize well.  They did!  I went and found my DPH, and first took two 50 mg gel caps.  After about another 10 minutes, I took the other two, and decided that I'd best stop for the night.  I took no one drug at what could be called a really `heavy' dose, but all of them together did kick in after about another 30 minutes. more and more as time went on.  I was fully aware that the state had been drug induced throughout the experience, never losing full contact with reality.  However, I did start having halleucinations, and by this time I really stopped noticing the clock.



The first one came when I was looking at a notepad.  I picked it up and brought it closer to my face, and realized there was writing on it.  `Like a dream,' I thought.  `Cool\ldots '  I tried to read it, and some of the words were intelligible, but mostly it was just gibberish.  I decided to trace over some of it with my pen since I knew that when I woke up, it wouldn't be there any longer.  I did this, but mostly what I got was `core soiu (unintelligible) 5 5 5 5'.  After that, I gave up and moved my operation into the living room.  Walking wasn't very difficult at all, much to my surprise.  I could tell the DXM hadn't fully kicked in yet, though it was definitely starting to.  What I think I felt most at this point was the Dramamine, and a touch of the DPH.  However, while walking, I noticed an almost salvia-like effect in the way that everything looked `geometric', almost like the world was a stained-glass representation of itself.  I could see the borders surrounding each different color quite clearly, and marveled at that.  I could also see writing form on the walls as I watched, and I could even look closely at it.  I could also see short little `vid clips' of diverse things.  Most of the `vid clips' I saw in the shadows and projected onto the walls, etc\ldots  were like news coverage of various things all around the world.  And I marveled at how I could stare at them and they didn't go away.  I'd also see nonsensical things, like streamers of ribbon that seemed to materialize out of nowhere and swirl through the air, or limbs and twigs just at the periphery of my field of vision.  The curtains moved, the floor danced, and I was in heaven.



I sat on the couch, and noticed my friend's crystal ball sitting on his coffee table (I'm house sitting for him).  The instant I looked at it I could see the fog swirling around within it (I've done scrying stone-cold sober, and wondered what I might be capable of seeing in THIS state), so I decided to try scrying.  I picked it up, held it in my hands and gazed.  I saw so many things coming at me one right after the other - scenes from people's lives and places out in the woods and train tracks and so much more\ldots   Like the drugs had unleashed a fired frenzy from the depths of my mind and I now had to witness it first hand.  But yet, none of the scenery seemed related to `me' in any way.  Past lives?  Other lives in parallel universes?  Pure imagination?  Who knows.  Probably pure imagination, but it was quite intriguing nonetheless.  At one point right around here, I threw something away, and when I looked in after it in the garbage can, I saw what looked like giant slugs crawling all over the garbage.  I forced myself to see what it `really' was, and realized they were just the shadows.  I was thrilled!



At one point, I was lying back on the couch, had the lights off, and closed my eyes.  It was like I fell asleep, but didn't.  When I opened my eyes again, I could see the entire room had become `bent'.  Like a crease right down the middle divided the upper half from the lower half, and each half slanted towards the right.  I could see each detail of the room clearly, just slanted.  It surprised me how much detail I could see - things I knew were there, only `twisted' or `transformed'.  Then I realized to my amazement that I had a pillow on my chest, and wasn't seeing the room at all.  My mind had managed to interpret the patterns of shadow and light on the pillow into a distorted vision of the room - quite effectively, I might add.  When I removed the pillow, I could see the room was straight once more.  It was around this time that I noticed the `dry mouth' phenomenon.  At least I had the presence of mind to have a jug of water beside me.



Then I started going through that thing where you don't know where you are.  I kept thinking I was in my own apartment, or in my childhood home, or in any other place but the one I was in.  Or if I knew I was here at my friend's house, I thought I was lying on the bed when I was really on the couch.  Sometimes, I would open my eyes and look around, and for an instant see the place I thought I was in.  Then it would just sort of `let go' and in a puff of air I'd be back on my friend's couch.  Other times I would open my eyes \& look around, and I would see my friend's house as it is, but I would be thoroughly convinced it was the place I thought I was - my apartment, my parent's house or `wherever'.



Everywhere there were faces, making up each and every little particle of the universe, it seemed, and I wondered if I wasn't just a face making up a part of some larger universe.  People of all races, ages \& descriptions in every mood or situation imaginable.  And I would see these other lives, as if they were happening then and there, and wonder if I were connected to these people in some way or what.  Perhaps they were characters in a book I'm about to write, trying to introduce themselves to me.



I did eventually go to sleep around 9 p.m. or so, and had many many hundreds of wild \& wonderful dreams.  This morning I had trouble getting up.  I'd keep getting up \& going to the bathroom, only to wake up again and realize that was just a dream.  This happened continuously, at least 20 times in the span of a few minutes.  But I knew that when I really got up, I'd know it.  I did, and found it was around 11:30 p.m. - I'd slept more than 12 hours.  Not a surprise with the Unisom.



Now, at 12:50 the following day, I'm still buzzing, but not so much with visuals any more.  I can get a few if I focus on doing that, but for the most part I'm seeing the world as it `really' is.  I plan on going out to the grocery store and doing more of this stuff.  I am having some auditory halleucinations now, but nothing major.  No `voices', just mostly hearing things like a dog whining, plates cracking or silverware being rattled in the kitchen.  I didn't have any auditory halleucinations during the high point of my trip last night, so I figure this must be from one of the metabolized by-products of one of these drugs.  I'll have to research and figure out which one.



Normally, DXM would make me way too nauseous, but I think the Dramamine, in addition to adding to the trip, really helped, because I feel no nausea even now.  I believe this combination might work for someone who tolerates the drugs individually without any problem.  But the dosage is important - I've always needed more than your average person, So know your own potential sensitivity. If you're small-built, skinny \& short, you might need less than half of what all I took.  Don't get crazy just to feel a rush, mmkay?     I certainly do think this is a useful combination for `exploring' yourself for the psychonaut-oriented, but it's also not at all bad just for some very un-serious tripping. Remember not to drive while under heavy influence, and even try avoiding stairs or slanted surfaces.  Like many drugs, this combo wreaks havoc with your sense of balance, so it's best to not be anywhere that tripping, stumbling, falling or lack of motor coordination is likely to get you injured or killed.  





Anywho, be fun, play safe and live long!
