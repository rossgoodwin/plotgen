Having been very anxious to try this substance since hearing of it several months ago I was very excited to receive my package yesterday. 



Method:

I am very experienced with research chemicals and have been a daily pot smoker for the best part of 15yr. I've always understood the need for safety and caution when trying something of this potency for the first time and I cannot stress it enough that this is ESSPECIALLY true with this one. I do not have a mg accurate scale or anything close which is definitely the only safe way to go but I figured enough caution and patience might give me a decent buffer. I've read in several places the size of their successful doses was around the size of a match head/pin head. I made a long thin spoon to get it from the bag using a small pinhead for the mold of the spoon part. I poured about 1/4 of this into a makeshift foil vape pipe (I won't get into schematics, it's foil; it's the metal equivalent to clay! get creative:)) and went for it. It melted instantly and was in my lungs and cashed in less than half a lungful with no burn whatsoever. After holding it in for 20 seconds or so I let out a surprisingly large thick cloud of smoke. the taste wasn't bad at all, a little synthetic but barely noticeable. After about one minute I felt a very mild change in mindset, a little light and happy. I waited about 15 minutes and decided it was safe to proceed and tossed the rest of the spoonful in there and finished it in the same fashion as before.



Experience:

T+00:05 - At this point I was well aware of a nice rush building up in the depths of my core. This eventually spared to pretty much everywhere followed by a giggle and a grin I couldn't wipe off my face. This was definitely about to be a good place to be (my head)

t+00:15 - Still coming up at this point and was getting a little worried I might have overdone it a little but those thoughts were fleeting and the euphoria I was feeling at the time made them very bearable. At this point I was emerged in a nice pulsing body high but aside from the mood lift and slight breakdown of attention span my head was surprisingly clear. it was like being alert and trapped in a stoned body.



t+00:30 - Things seemed to have leveled off at this point. My vision is definitely altered slightly. No hallucinations but more like alterations; things had a somewhat 3D'er (already 3D right) look to them. I definitely am stoned now, fairly similar to MJ but for me almost better. I tend to get paranoid easily, munch out to the pong of getting groggy and pass out. This is definitely a more upbeat energetic , clean high. There's some cottonmouth going on at this point and water tastes and feels fantastic. 



t+00:45 - Still grinning like an idiot. Working on the computer is getting a little tiring and I'm making more typos than ever! I'm still pretty much plated at this point but I have a sense I'm about to start a decent. Listening to some industrial music while laying on my bed as just what the Dr. ordered. Music  kind of buzzes around the room and through me, very, very cool. The mild paranoia has left and I'm in a nice pleasant heady place , just happy to be able to let my mind drift. Thoughts were clear but random and short lived but generally very positive (good memories, funny things that happened this week, the nice way I was feeling at the moment act.)



t+1:00 - Definitely on my way down now. The come down is gradual and you can almost not tell. I'm feeling a little week and the thought of laying on the couch and vegging out to some history channel is sounding really nice. I'm getting a little hungry but can't tell if it's munchies because it's almost breakfast time anyway and it's not a binge type hunger. Mood is pretty content really, like everything is OK and  that is definitely the  chemicals because this is NEVER the case for me. 



t+1:30 - Pretty much back to reality and not very happy about it. I'm about to eat a very welcomed breakfast and feel physically very good. No headaches, no tore up lungs, good and just a nice mellow afterglow remains (along with a smaller but still holding out grin)



Summary:

 It was a great first try and I could easily see this replacing weed for people on probation or who get tested for work or whatever. I'm definitely going to enjoy polishing off the rest of the 1g and am planning on stocking up before it's too late and the Feds take away our new toy (again). For the price ($\sim$50\$/g,) it's perfect for cheep bastards like me and unlike with many research chums doesn't require any compromise in effect or side effect.



THE ONLY REASON I WAS SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING HIGH BUT NOT FREAKING OUT WAS I WAS EXTREMELY CAUTIONS AND SLIGHTLY LUCKY!

TAKE WHAT YOU THINK IS A DOSE!

CUT THAT IN HALF!

THEN TAKE HALF OF ONE OF THOSE HALVES!

THE REST WILL STILL BE THERE IF YOU NEED MORE!

DON'T BE BRAVE

BUY A MG SCALE!
