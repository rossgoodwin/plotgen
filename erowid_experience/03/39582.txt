I finally received a script for Dexedrines. It's kind of difficult to get it here without raising major suspicions. Very anxious to try it out. I used to be a heavy drug user in the past. I was a constant E user for 2 years and I have stopped in 2003 (about 2 years ago). However, I am still a major marijuana user and drinker. I have recently stopped smoking marijuana for 3 months before this experience. I am on an anti-depressant called Lexapro/Cipralex containing Escitalapram. I am taking 10mg a day. I haven't took any for this experience but I have ingested one a day before. Today I am generally happy as heard some good news, which seems like ages. I have done a fair bit of walking around town on empty stomach prior to ingesting. Here is my trip report. This is written live. Well, it is live after +T6.00 anyway.



+T0.00 Ingested 1x5mg tablet on empty stomach. Haven't eaten anything for 8 hours after waking up at 9am.



+T0.30 Slight uplift of mood. Could be a placebo effect. Not very sure now as I have taken some illegal drugs in the past.



+T1.00 Ingested another 5mg tablet. Still feeling nothing much. Did some cleaning (not by choice).



+T1.30 Mood became better. I was chattier and had motivation to do things I didn't bother to do. Did more housework (by choice!).



+T2.00 Had to have dinner because spouse cooked. Ate a heavy dinner. Appetite was not affected. Was very very chatty during dinner time. Felt happy and fulfilled.



+T2.30 Feeling started to `normalise'. Decided to take 2x5mg tablets this time.



+T4.00 Helped out with dishes and general housework etc. Feeling more and more sobered up. Regretted wasting 2 tablets on a full stomach.



+T.4.30 Beginning to feel a bit sedated and sleepy. Effects comparable to being under the influence of cannabis.



+T5.00 Ingested further 2x5mg tablets. This time I bite them to bits. Not bitter.



+T5.30 Positive effects felt. Slight tingling in hands. 



+T5.40 Definitely feeling different. Ingested 1x5mg. I bite the tablets until it was powdery before swallowing. Surprisingly it didn't taste very bitter. Must be the filler and binders mixed in together with the dexamphetamine. Ah, thorns among a beautiful rose. This is the reason why I choose not to insufflate.



+T6.00 Suddenly had the mood to switch off lights and listen to some hardcore trance music. Head buzz and hand buzz very prominent. Decided to type this report. Also noticed that my sexual urges has increased. Due to my medication (Escitalapram) I rarely get sexually aroused. At this point I am alone with no other human interaction.



+T6.30 Effects are minimising now though still felt. Feel like ingesting another tablet in conjunction with drinking a cold bottle of beer (5\% alc). Not really feeling sexually aroused now but feel as though able to have intercourse, which is good because I was having difficulty maintaining and achieving erection just 2 nights ago, which could have been caused by the Ibuprofen I took for my fever in addition to the escitalapram.



+T6.45 1x5mg tablet was crushed with my molars and washed down with icy cold beer. 



+T6.50 Went to the toilet to urinate. I noticed my penis was slightly shrunk but not as bad when I used to be high on E. Still feeling a bit neutral. Nothing much new. Enjoying my beer and music. I am starting to wonder if additional dosages won't make a difference at this stage. Please let me be wrong! :)



+T7.00 A plastic plate dropped behind me and that startled me. Perhaps a bit paranoia is being felt.



+T7.10 Finished around half bottle of beer. Sort of drinking very slowly. Noticed no major changes. Perhaps I have already hit the plateau and there would no longer be any higher rushes? Mood so far good although a bit disapointed while waiting for the buzz to come again. Maybe I am already there but I don't realise it? Massive questions.



+T7.30 Went out for a ciggie. Finished it rather fast. Noticed my motor skills had slightly deteriorated. Perhaps it is due to the alcohol. However, I have just consumed one bottle of 5\% beer so far. I noticed my penis had shrunken more than before although not to the extreme. I checked my pupils and it is normal. Opened another bottle of beer. Considering having a last tablet to see if anything happens.



+T8.00 Feeling the beer buzz now. Still on 2nd bottle. Nothing much is happening except for the feeling of being generally drunk. I am going to ingest another 2x5mg now and DEFINITELY will call it quits after this. A bit disappointed at how short the effects last. Perhaps its due to my own biological setup?



+T11.00 Nothing pretty much happened. Just played few rounds of computer games and had another beer. I noticed a slight headache and pressure to the top centre of the skull. Perhaps it is due to the game I am playing. Alcohol is indeed not synergetic with dexamphetamine. Didn't really feel way up there but just plateau. Gonna give my body a rest and see what happens tomorrow.







Conclusion: I don't think that dexamphetamine is a highly abusable as such widely known. Unlike the infamous Ecstacy concoctions, the effect doesn't last that long. It brought me to the level and that's it. No matter how much I take I don't feel anything else. Perhaps this is the safety buffer so that people won't overdose and perhaps suffer mortal consequences. I am only speaking from my point of view and is not debunking any current views and opinions.



I will definitely try a tweak run again. Today's short lasted climax could be caused by body exhaustion from recently recovering from sickness and had little food to eat past few days or my anti-depressant (SSRI) blocking the maximum effect. On the next run I will fully replenish my body and also try some gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents to counter the effects of the SSRI, if any. This agent is known to intensify and prolong amphetamines. I don't fancy swallowing pure sodium bicarbonate so I will find some over the counter medications which has that as active ingredient.
