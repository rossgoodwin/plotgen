I was 17 years old, and had never tripped before. I was very experienced with weed, and had experimented with a few other substances, but I had never had mushrooms before. When I was given the opportunity to shroom, I jumped at it.



I read everything I could find about psilocybin. I decided it was safe enough, although I was somewhat worried about having a bad trip. My friends and I decided the beach would be a good environment for the trip. We left early that morning, excited and nervous.



About 8:00 am my friend (Dave) and I crushed the mushrooms into two glasses of orange juice. The mushrooms were smallish, and brown-gray. Not a powerful appearance at all. We downed the cups quickly, making `yuck' faces. My other two friends (Mike and Dennis) took two hits of acid each instead of mushrooms. None of us had eaten in the past twelve hours.



We walked from the car into the sand and laid out our little camp. A couple towels and a CD player; we were set. About 20 minutes after ingestion, I started laughing at everything. Every comment, every movement was extremely amusing to me. `They're working,' I announced. Soon I had an intense body high, similar to ecstasy. I noticed little lines wiggling around everything. If I closed my eyes, the brightest kaleidoscope would dance behind my eyelids. Patterns would turn into shapes, people, animals, and combinations of all three.



When I came to my peak, I was completely gone. My friends' talking made very little sense. All four of us would repeat things over and over till it was understood or forgotten about. I ignored everyone, and concentrated on the show. It seemed to me that my mind had become a sort of playground. I could trip watching and listening to the waves, watch the colors as they came in and the patterns that developed in them. Or I could stare at my towel. The texture of it made amazing patterns and was fun to touch, too. There were so many ways to have fun. I would go back and forth between these activities, enjoying myself immensely. I also thought about the deeper topics of life. I decided I wasn't afraid of death. I became friends with all the plant life on the dune next to me; all life was beautiful. I smoked a cigarette for half an hour, maybe more, unlit.



Dave and I decided to walk down to the waves. I stood up and began to walk. Amazing! Moving around felt like the earth was spinning beneath my feet like a treadmill. I realized at that point that I really had very little control over what was going on. `Man, I can't tell whether I'm awake, or dreaming this.'



`Yeah, I'm tripping out hard, I wish I had more mushrooms, or some of that acid though.'



I had forgotten completely about the mushrooms. I found his comment almost vulgar. I felt I was becoming closer to all life, and all he could think about was more drugs. I felt like no one understood what I had learned, or how I thought. I am not usually an emotional person at all, so these thoughts were very alien to me. We walked back to the group and I sat back down, resuming my wave-watching. The others decided to go back to the car to listen to music on my friend's nice stereo. I elected to stay behind, too content to move.



While alone I pondered life further. Trains of thought were coming and going and evolving so quickly. I would have a stunning revelation, and forget it twenty seconds later. While doing this, I was holding an unlit cigarette, and trying to figure out how to put new batteries in my CD player. A man was suddenly in front of me, saying something. I couldn't understand him, so I stared dumbly. `Is that a TV you've got there?' I finally understood.



`Uhh no. It's just broken, I'm trying to fix it.' I knew I seemed weird to him. He walked away, and I suddenly felt very ill physically. I got up and started walking to the car, leaving all of our things unguarded. I spotted the car and it seemed to stretch away into the distance, then come rushing back. I felt like I could barely make it to the car. I was completely drained of energy, and I felt very nauseous. I finally made it to the car, opened the door, and fell into the back seat. `What the fuck?' inquired Mike.



`I don't feel so great, man. I can't move.'



My friends began to panic a little. I didn't care. I was beginning to feel very sleepy. My friends left the car. The heat was unbearable, I took off my shirt and laid across the back seat. I began feeling very stupid for taking the mushrooms. I was hearing screaming voices very loud. They weren't saying anything, just loud primal screams from many voices. I also heard didgeridoos very loudly. I was quite scared and began to wish I was still sleeping at home. I actually fell asleep at one point. I woke up feeling very cold and drenched in sweat. `I'm actually going to die,' I thought.



My friends came back to the car and tried to make me get up to get water. I replied, `Fuck off.' They decided that it was best we go back to Mike's house. The thought of him driving us home on his first acid trip terrified me, but I was too out of it to interject.



We got back to his house. I was feeling a little better, but the physical sickness was still there. I came down in the next few hours at his house. I was still feeling out of it when I went to work at 5:00 pm.



I have done mushrooms many times since this occasion. I have never experienced the sickness or had a bad experience since then. I have never tripped as hard since then either. My guess is that I got food poisoning from bacteria on a mushroom or that it was completely imagined. I felt sick long after the affects wore off, so I have to go with the first one.
