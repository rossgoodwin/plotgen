Friend `B'

Friend `D'- `B's' girlfriend

Throughout all of this experience i feel as if i could've freaked out easily. The only thing that prevented that was that i could keep my mouth shut\ldots 



Circa 5PM



I freebase one hit of god knows how much JWH. Within 3 minutes Im feeling the effects of something coming on. I start to come up much quicker than expected. My blood pressure and heart rate skyrocket to crazy levels. I can feel every single electric pulse in my muscles. Pins and needles feeling throughout my body. It feels like my blood vessels are stretching to a size unhealthy. My brain feels like its going to explode out my skull.



Circa 5:15PM

I've covinced myself I'm dying.



Sounds begin to become amplified. The airconditioner's hum starts getting louder than I know it actually is. Very soon after realizing this the sound of the airconditioner becomes all I can hear. This situation only heightens. Extreme `sandbox' feeling. B's room becomes a diorama and all objects that arent moving take on a 2 dimentional effect. Nausea sets in. I'm freezing. At once I become exhausted. I fall into a state of semi consciousness and start to nod off. I decide I need to lie down to get over the nausea, paranoia, and anxiety thats taken over my brain.



B and D get up to go down to grab a drink and check on their pet rat. I stand up and for a split second I'm standing on the ceiling. I shake my head and I'm standing on the wall. B gives me a funny look. I try my best to formulate the sentence, `I'm sorry man, but I'm having a difficult time getting a good grip on whats going on in my head right now. Would you mind if I just hung out up here while you guys do all that?' All that comes out is something like `uuhhmmnn. I wanna stay here dude, I'm way too high' most likely with a bemused look on my face and strange inflections. I resume lying down.



What happens next can only be explained by saying I wasn't all there anymore. The sound of the air conditioner is ear splitting. I want to cry. Insane closed eye visuals consisting of rainbow cats and fuckin wild necromorph demons scares the shit out of me. My brain feels like a live wire. I begin trying to calm myself down with deep breaths but it only works for a fraction of a second. I consider telling someone that I need to go to the hospital. I'm in pain all throughout my body. I decide to keep my mouth shut.



B and D reenter the room. I'm under a blanket and I don't respond when called on; I'm unable to formulate any words. Somehow the blanket is off my head and I'm talking with B about leaving and going for a walk. The thought terrifies me. Eventually I give in. Anything to escape how loud the fucking airconditioner is. I stand up to even more intense symptoms of vertigo. Walking is hard. My perception is constantly changing. I go down to the bathroom to take a piss but end up staring at my dick the entire time weirded out. I look in the mirror. Bad idea. I hallucinate and I don't look like myself. My eyes are huge and red. I shake it off and go out. The sounds of outside are just as intense as the airconditioner. I find myself focusing on one noise until it grows to deafening proportions at which point I cant turn it off. The constant feeling of needing to piss soldiers on.



We get to a convenience store for a drink as cotton mouth sets in. As I reach the door extreme visual hallucinations take hold. The room is skewed far to the left and my arm reaches the floor. Peoples faces are funny and the doors on the fridges are giant. I decide theres no possible way I could interact with a cashier. We immediately get out of there drinkless.



Every time I move my eyes my equilibrium shifts. I now know what it feels like to have vertigo. The walk to the park is difficult. I don't say much but I exchange glances with B and brainwave `I'm way too fucked up'. We laugh. I'm no longer in pain.



I make it to the swings with little idea of where I am. All I know is the color scheme at the park is fucking wild. Paranoia sets in but less intense by this point. I stand up to go take a piss in the woods. I'm immediately 10 stories tall and I look down to my feet which seem miles away. Piss felt good. I describe my situation to B, `I feel like I'm dying but thats cool, this is awesome'



We leave to grab food and the thought of human interaction still terrifies me. As soon as I sit down I lose the visual hallucinations but I start to sweat like crazy and get intense headrushes. I'm exhausted. I adopt the story that I was playing an intense game of basketball as per B's suggestion. The cover story calms me down immensely.



We leave and once outside I get intense feelings of euphoria and my eyes could easily roll in the back of my head. I'm pleased. My memory is blank between realizing I was rolling and getting back to B's. We watch the rat for a while and I come down to a comfortable state of being really fucking high. That I can manage. Still nauseous until I leave.



Circa 8PM



My walk to the train was painful. lactic acid had built up in my body. I can only assume because my body was working overclocked. Every step I took sent severe pain to my lower abdomen. Eventually it goes away after sitting.



I get home to Italian ice and Im still high enough to enjoy video games until I pass out.



I wake up the next day perfectly fine. I give myself a pat on the back for not puking, pissing myself, or freaking out outside my own head. Fuck you B, there was definitely more than 2 milligrams on that little piece of tinfoil. Thank you B, that was officially the weirdest day in my entire life. The world is a funny place. I'm definitely going to be smoking more of that shit.
