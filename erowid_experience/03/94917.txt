 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\#  



Background: I am slightly experienced in the realm of psychadelics. I am a daily user of cannabis, I have been drunk around 6 or 7 times, I have also tried Salvia, Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Amanita Muscaria, Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds, 2-CE, Cyclobenzaprine, Tobacco (Don't smoke/chew), Buprenorphine, Diazepam, DXM, LSD, and now 4-AcO-DMT. I haven't had a legit full-blown trip yet. L and I have been trying for some time with little success, the LSD we took was very weak and it was only 1 tab. I had extreme mental clarity on the HBW seeds, but other than that, nothing more than low-to-moderate visuals. Had never lost my ego before. 



Setting: I am doing this at my friend's house with him; let's call him `L'. I go there often and am very familiar with the environment as well as comfortable while there.I had a basketball game earlier that day along with a 5 hour standarzied test. Needless to say I was mentally and physically exhausted. I did however take a nap of about 3.5 hours to restore mental stamina for later. It is also worth noting I had not eaten anything since around 1:00 p.m. earlier that day. 



+0:00 We dosed at 11:30 p.m.. The dosage was calculated by mixing 100 mg of 4-AcO-DMT into 1 cup of Vitamin Water and then measuring a 1/2 cup out for each of us. We drank the mixture over the course of 5 minutes while watching TV. 



+0:05 First effects are noticed. Subtle, but defnitely not placebo. Heart rate slightly increases. 



+0:10 Effects are noticeably present. My body was vibrating with energy, it felt as if my body was just emnating energy. I put my leg on a table with a space heater on it, and I could feel the hum of the heater throughout my whole body and it was very enchanting. 



+0:15 I started laughing excessively at things that weren't even that funny. L and I decide to go upstairs to lay down to prepare for the following stages of the trip. Walking up the steps was moderately difficult. My thoughts were beginning to scramble and it became slightly hard to concentrate. 



+0:20 I was looking straight up at the ceiling while laying down and the walls and ceilings began to breathe. When I focused on a specifc place patterns began to form. First, it was infinite spirals of the number `3'. I felt like I could zoom my vision in and out upon demand. 



+0:30 I felt like I was beginning to lose control of the trip, it was onsetting too quickly and I wasn't even close to peaking yet. I lost the concept of what `an upstairs' was. I couldn't grasp the idea of a second floor, don't ask me why. I do not remember much of what was going on at this point. I do recall that the posts of the stairs was bending and melting. Also, the room felt like it was closing in on me, but that could be due to the fact that the lights were off. I was no longer comfortable at this stage of the experience. Time was also extremely dilated. I checked my phone after what seemed to be an hour or two, only to find that a minute had passed. It was at this point that I realized I was going to have a long night. 



+0:45 Ideas were flowing extremely fast and I didn't elaborate on each thought much at all, so when I tried talking it couldn't have made much sense. It made sense to me, but my friend just gave me weird looks. (Upon later reflection, we discovered that we felt like we were actually talking to each other through mental thoughts, rather than speech. He couldn't understand my speech, but he could understand my idea/thought.) Visuals were pretty strong. Many things were twisting and breathing. I felt my ego beginning to soften. I just laid there in frustration as I felt my very own ego begin to slip from my grasp.



+1:00 Short term memory had a span of about 3 seconds. I couldn't even finish sentences without forgetting what they are about. Ego was hanging on by only a thread at this point. Visuals continued, except they softly morphed from light DMT visuals to Shroom visuals. Geometric patterns were in abundance with alternating colors. I was getting claustrophobic from the darkness of the room pressing up on me. I could not feel my body much during this time and I could not distinguish my blanket from my clothes and/or body. Still uncomfortable, doubts began to spring in my mind. 



+1:30 My ego was long gone. Time ceased to exist or mean anything. There was no such thing as time. I could not remember how old I was. My name was resonating in my head so that I wouldn't forget it. It was one thing from reality that I could cling to. I came close to forgetting it several times. `4-AcO-DMT' was also resonating in my mind in case something bad happened and someone needed to know what I took. I refused to forget what drug I took. Not that it mattered. I was shattered into pieces. 



Everything was one, there was no such thing as a `difference'. I was on a higher plane of existence, a plane shared with higher powers within the universe. I did not directly communicate with these higher powers; I wanted to just leave them alone and not attract attention. I figured out that I only attracted their attention when I asked questions. So I was frantically trying to avoid asking questions whether it was vocally or within my conscious. It was a very difficult thing to do. I relieved my whole life in the flash of an instant, or what was equal to an instant when time was not relative. Since I was able to view my whole life, I came to a conclusion that there was a possiblity that my life was just fabricated, much like The Matrix. And fear began to really grow when I thought about if I would ever go back to `reality', if I could even call it that. It literally felt like I was in the state for thousands of years, if not infinite years. I severely missed Time; I had taken him for granted. Never again. Then, I felt like I had all the knowledge in the universe, it was a truly magnificent feeling, except for the fact that I knew some dangerous information. I don't recall specifically what that information was and I regret not writing it down (Not that I would have physically been able to). After acquiring this `dangerous' information, I suddenly did not want all that knowledge anymore and simply wanted to be ignorant of such things. 



I just wanted the trip to end. One my of my biggest frustrations was that I could not tell if my eyes were open or closed. Closed eye and open visuals were synonymous. Sometime during this extension of insanity, L suggested we go down stairs. I don't know if he spoke it or thought it, but I understood regardless. I sat up in an upright position, and realized I was unable to get up. I simply couldn't, my legs refused to cooperate. So I laid back down, still wanting it all to just be over. 



+2:45(ish)  My ego was beginning to return, but it wasn't in any rush. I still had no control of the trip and the visuals were still intense. This time I suggested we go downstairs. I tried the same thing as before, but was able to stand this time with extreme will power. I carefully made my way down the steps with L in tow. We plopped right on the couch and covered up with blankets. L's mother came down and asked what was going on. I replied, `We just couldn't sleep, I wasn't as tired from my test as I thought. I know, I'm weird.' I guess that answer sufficed, because she headed back upstairs. I wasn't even sure if what I said came out in English, I could only pray. Then I kept saying things to L and after one time he suddenly said, `That never happened'. This fucked me big time. I was no longer sure what was real and if certain things in my life had happened or not. I just immediately shut up and quit talking. We then decided to head into the bathroom to check out our pupils. Oh my God, I could barely see any color in my eyes. My pupils were extremely dilated, and I mean extremely as in unhuman. I felt like I was slowly regaining control of the trip. I mentioned this to L and he replied, `We aren't coming down man. Think about it.' So I did think about it.I thought, `What if this is just a trick the trip is playing on me? Like a trip within a trip\ldots ' Scary shit to think about when you just wanted it to end anyways. We decided to go back upstairs to ride out the rest of the trip. 



+3:30 Well, the ego is almost full intact. I have just been floating around hyperspace while laying down. My friend's face or figure would sometimes morph into something grotesque and frightening and worsen my already terrible mood. I am unable to go to sleep, but a restlessness feeling persists. I tried numerous times to just fall asleep, but to no avail. I found out L was having the same problem. We just laid in silence for what seemed like days. 



+5:00 Finally starting to noticeably come down. Visuals were persisiting, but much weaker than before. I could speak again, and think semi-clearly. I was still emotionally shattered in several pieces from having my ego ripped from me in such a violent manner. L and I began to share our experience we just had. We talk for maybe 30 minutes, but then his mom asked why we were still up, so neither of us replied. We just put our heads to our pillow and pretended to sleep. This actually was beneficial to me, as I fell asleep after 15 minutes. 



Afterwards: Overall, the trip it self was around 6 hours. I feel like I learned so much from this experience. It was a bad trip, make no mistake, but I am learning from my bad experiences. There has to be injuries in order for you to heal and become stronger. Reflecting on this, I'm very glad this happened to me. It was a wake up call for me. I awoke with only 4 hours of sleep and I did not feel tired at all. A faint afterglow was present throughout the day. L and I smoked a bowl that morning with no complications and my drive home was very scenic and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would definitely do this again, except definitely at a lower dose. I believe 50 mg is EXTREMELY too high for a beginner dose and I will take responsibility for my reckless mistake. I paid for that mistake and do not intend to make the same one again.
