Last night I experimented with Phencyclidine (PCP), the whereabouts of obtaining it was through a friend. It came in a white crystalline form in a small bag.  



Environment: Bedroom



Dose: two lines insufflated with a dollar bill



The experience: 



It was friday night and I had just gotten home from working a shitty job, I hadn't anything planned so I decided to call up some acquaintances in which I could score some pure MDMA. I attempted to call the dealer in which I would normally get my MDMA tabs from, then I remembered he had left on vacation with his girlfriend. I had only a couple of sources for the MDMA Tabs and did not want to travel to far to get them. When I had given up all hope, I said F''K it. I'll just go do something else probably get out of my smelly ass work cloths which reeked of coffee beans and ass, due to the shitty cafe environment I work at. To continue I took off my shirt to shower and my cell started playing `stars and stripes'. I know what a odd ring tone to choose, but it's a crappy cell.



It was my friend Adam, he told me if I wasn't busy that night and he would like to see me. I told him why not. He came over and asked me if I had tried PCP. He is the same person with which I experimented with acid. I told him I hadn't even really pondered on the idea of trying PCP. I told him why? That's when he took out a small bag with white crystals. I told him it looked pretty cool but before I try anything I want to research the effects of PCP on the internet. It didn't seem all that bad so I told Adam if I wouldn't be attempting to fly out the window if I took it, he told me that's a myth. Well I wasn't going to waste anymore time, so we took out a small razor blade and cut up some of the crystals and formed it into a line. 



I was going to wait till Adam finished the first line. He did so, until it was my turn. I took the first line and got a kind of a funny sniffy feeling. Just probably jitters, I was going to have to wait at least a couple of minutes till I felt any onset effects, but just said fuck it and told Adam to prepare two more lines. Adam once again took the next sniff. Without hesitation, I took the second. That was the last of what we had. I read the onset had come on anywhere between a few minutes to an hour or so.  The next thirty minutes or so I decided we'd put on some tunes. I put on a mixed CD which Adam brought with him, which consisted mainly of rock songs, misc. techno, drum and bass, and trip hop music. Adam and I discussed of what we both had been up to the last time since we spoke, our conversation became more fluent and easy going as the minutes passed by. 



I put on the visualizer on win-amp. Adam told me the colors looked as if they where alive. That's when the trip began. I started feeling as if a strong presence came over me, Adam told me how the feeling of being dusted is strange and you feel disconnected. That is just how I felt. I had a strange feeling and my voice started to sound monotone, which freaked me out. Adam was just sitting there and I felt as If I was making robotic motions with my body. I told Adam if he thought I looked like a robot right then. He just looked at me and told me what I was talking about. I told him I was just joking him. He didn't respond much. I decided I needed a drink of water, so I went to my kitchen to get a glass of water.



I had trouble trying to get the cup off the cupboard shelf but I finally retrieved it, my motor functions where kind of slow. I found it strange to pour a simple glass of water and thought about stopping before I broke anything. I did notice I spilt some water on the floor, so I put back the water and decided to go back my room. When I went back Adam was looking out the window. He told me how weird the cars looked outside, I looked outside and saw the neighborhood I kind of was relieved, somewhat. I asked him if he was alright he just mumbled something and sat back down. I finally got out of the view of the window and attempted to find the chord for my ipod. I kept stopping and got somewhat confused and forgot what I was looking for. 



It wasn't the same kind of forgetfulness I experience with marijuana which is way more distracting, but instead just a kind of amnesia I would experience from a successful drug trip, where the effects are going as according to plan. For sometime in the trip I kept thinking I had machine arms and what it was like to live in the sewers. I even thought Adam was staring at me strangely at times, then I realized he was in a world of his own.



I have no further plans on getting dusted anymore, probably due to it being controversial and the circulating news that it can damage your brain after prolonged use. Also the addictive properties of the drug. Its only a one time thing, if not two. Also a substance in which many will never abuse. Be careful this is a tricky substance.
