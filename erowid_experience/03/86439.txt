I used to be really, really wary about the world of research chemicals.  I've always been hesitant to order them, and for a long time was simply on a slightly hypocritical `pure drug' trip.  I say hypocritical because while I've always been heavily into the classic tryptamines - DMT, psilocybin/psilocin/baeocystin, and LSD, I really have enjoyed MDMA and MDA. This year I've been learning a lot more about Alexander Shulgin, and gained a deeper respect for him while attending the Psychedelic Science in the 21st Century conference and decided it was time to broaden my horizons and enjoy some of his work.  This began back in April when I tried 2c-b for the first time; I've since tried 2c-b a number of times and really enjoyed it a great deal.



Frankly, though, I've always been more of a tryptamine man than a phenethylamine fan.  So I've been very curious to try some of Shulgin's tryptamine work, especially 4-AcO-DMT which I plan on getting around to soon. Friday night, though, I dipped into the 4-HO-MiPT pool and let me tell you, I think 4-HO-MiPT is an experience well worth undertaking.



I met up with some friends to go see the New York Philarmonic play a free concert in Prospect Park.  It was a hot, humid night and we spread out a blanket under the boughs of a tree. We drank a little bit of wine - I had about a half a glass of white - and while my friends ate some cheese, bread and bosc pears, I ate 20mg of 4-HO-MiPT.  I wasn't feeling much at all about fifteen to twenty minutes later and was handed another 20mg capsule of the tryptamine - this one I dumped between my knuckles and insufflated.  Within the next 5-10 minutes the onset of the drug began to hit.



At first a restlessness built, and a feeling of general bodily discomfort. I couldn't find a comfortable position to lay in, found myself suddenly concerned over whether or not I was getting dirty laying in the grass beneath this tree.  Constantly shifting, I tried following the two separate conversations my two pairs of friends were having but was increasingly lost in my thoughts. I stood up, walking slowly away from the blanket and feeling a bit disoriented.  I felt mildly drunk, but knew it was definitely the tryptamine and not the bit of wine I'd had.



I sat down again, and a feeling of agitation was swelling up in me.  At the same time, the sky looked more filled with stars than it had minutes before. Not stars, I realized, but small flickering points of light that were definitely visual perturbations brought on by the 4-HO-MiPT and not the sky as it would normally be perceived.  I turned to my friends, feeling the need to narrate my experience. I told them I was definitely high and that I felt really good but that I felt really agitated.  One of them laughed and pointed out that I'd just said I felt agitated in a completely calm voice.  That was true - I was feeling an agitation that was mainly a body load but really took a backseat to an overwhelming feeling of euphoria. Another friend offered me a pear, and I took it more just to hold than to eat.



While I held the pear, the drug really hit. There's one word that describes each and every sensory aspect of the experience: LUSH.  Visuals, auditory input, the feeling of my skin touching itself as I touched my body, the grass under my feet, the general feeling of being alive was lush. Juicy.  Incredible fractal geometry stitched through and through with rainbow lines that coursed with purple/magenta/green energy were spread out throughout the sky. Within minutes I was having some of the most salient, rich visuals I had ever had outside of smoking n,n-DMT.  They completely surpassed any visuals I had ever had with eyes open on either mushrooms or LSD.  The park folded and swelled, the ground unfolding before my eyes to reveal itself in endless layers.



I took a bite of the pear, and felt immediately nauseous. I handed the pear back, announcing that I no longer wished to hold it, and swallowed the bite I had taken with great difficulty, feeling incredibly nauseous. I thought about vomiting, but realized I just really didn't feel like it.  Others in the group went to the porta-potties far away and I lay with my friend Birgit describing the experience to her. I felt wonderful, I told her, and really full of a charged up sexual sort of energy.



She asked how this tryptamine differed from mushrooms which was a totally relevant question and I loved that she asked it.  It seemed nearly impossible, on this 4-HO-MiPT, to enter those dark corners of the psyche that mushrooms often took me to. Now, that is actually a quality of mushrooms that I enjoy, but it's also something that keeps me from eating mushrooms too often and approaching them with a healthy respect.  4-HO-MiPT, it seemed obvious to me, was just a lot more fun and something I could do without as heavy a heart as mushrooms.  I found myself wishing I could express my creativity in different forms, especially paint. I wanted to cover my hands in paint and smear them over a large white canvas.



Our other friends came back and one of them asked me, referring to a quote from Shulgin's entry on 4-HO-MiPT in TiHKaL, if I was experiencing the `sexual energy of a large jungle cat.'  In the state of mind I was in, that seemed completely reasonable.  The experience, again, was so LUSH and the visuals on the trees were so rich and juicy and jungle-like, that the mere suggestion of a jungle cat brought to mind images of myself running across an open field and diving into the grass.  In general I found that I could think of many, many things I wanted to do but knew that if I were to actually begin doing any of them (playing with the hula hoops a friend had brought, running across a field, dancing) I would immediately regret having expended the energy and want to sit down again.



The rest of the group wanted to get some wine, and the shops were soon to close, so we stood to go.  Standing was like entering a totally new world.  Frankly, I was tripping really hard.  Harder than I had expected to.  Everything shifted as I moved, the ground not sitting still for a moment.  I approached our tree, setting foot on it, feeling myself melt into it briefly before stepping away.  We walked out of the park, and I was really worried I didn't look sober at all because I definitely didn't feel sober at all.  One of my friends had taken some 4-HO-MiPT as well, the same amount as me, and was barely feeling anything except high.  I, meanwhile, was having one of the most enjoyably visual experiences of my life.



The wine shops were closed; I got into the front car of a cab and my friends piled in the back.  Strapped to the passenger seat, I felt like I was inside a transdimensional intergalactic mexican flea spaceship.  High pitched voices speaking Spanish buzzed from the cab's radio while music played from the radio, and the Brooklyn cityscape zoomed by.  Our driver ran two red lights, and was very unsafe in most of his turns.  I was holding on for dear life, watching the street lights and roads ooze in a way that was verging on sexual.  When we finally got back to my apartment, I was relieved.



There, the others drank beer and wine, and eventually broke out some MDMA which they insufflated.  I was feeling down from my tryptamine high after about 4 hours, and snorted 20mg more 4-HO-MiPT.  This was so incredibly pleasant.  For the next 3-4 hours, I didn't trip nearly as hard as I did off of the 40mg dose, but had incredibly beautiful visuals that suffused everything around me with a rainbow glow.  It seemed that wisps of language were floating in the air all throughout my apartment, and when I waved my hands through the air I could distort the visuals I was having, even paint with them.  The same magenta-purple-green energy coursed from various nodes suspended in reality, concentrated around my friends.  I resisted the urge to partake in the MDMA as well, having overdone it on that substance the past 3 weekends.  I got a lot of vicarious enjoyment out of watching my friends roll.



The comedown off both the 40mg and the later 20mg dose of the 4-HO-MiPT were incredibly manageable, I felt fantastic in fact.  This is a substance I look forward to exploring more in the future, and at even higher doses.  And if not at higher doses, then definitely continually insufflating it throughout a long night as a friend of mine has done.  I haven't really conveyed it in this report but the cerebral quality of the drug was perhaps the most enjoyable, beyond the erotic, lush, sensual energy that coursed through me and the glorious visuals.  I felt I was really able to work through complicated thought processes and have really elaborate, expansive conversation that the tryptamine consciousness lent itself to.



4-HO-MiPT.  Thumbs Up.
