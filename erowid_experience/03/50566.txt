Here's my background: late 20's white collar professional. I've never been `into' drugs, or any one drug in particular. I grew up without any criminal incidents in my past, an academic child, whose parents were both well educated, which looking back on it is lucky, since my parents divorced when I was very young and I had next to zero supervision. If I had fallen in with `the wrong crowd' who knows what could have happened. But as luck would have it, I never was exposed to much of anything in public school. I didn't even get drunk until my freshman year in college, at a frat pary!



In college I did my share of experimenting, but not to excess. I did mdma twice a year or so, and still do, pot off and on - pot is not a social drug for me, but it helps me sleep so I use it very occasionally, also I've tripped on shrooms (loved that!) and tried various painkillers, muscle relaxers, meth (hated it, felt like I was having a heart attack) and uppers. So I've tried just about everything at least once, except for acid - and that's only because I never had access to it. I never had any negative experiences, believe it or not, except some rough comedowns on E. I have `lost my shit' on shrooms and actually liked it. However, maybe due to the way I grew up ('drugs are bad, mmkay!') and my personal sense of respect for myself, I could live with or without drugs. I have no problem with them, it's just that if they disappeared from my life tomorrow, I wouldn't be crushed. I reserve using them for special occasions. the only drug I feel like I use too much is alcohol. But it's part of the culture of where I live - social activities revolve around drinking here. So, that's where I am coming from.



Enter cocaine. The experience was very memorable to the point where I felt the need to write it down. I never tried any drug that had such a `pull' on me! Here is how it happened: 



Drugs start showing up in much larger quantities this time of year, the weeks preceding the big carnival celebration. Dealers come into the city from all over and there is a lot of availability. The coke just fell into my lap, I didn't have to seek it out. I was over at the house of a good friend of mine. His roommate had been up for 2 days on coke. He had a lot of it sitting out on the dresser and asked if I wanted any. I just spontaneously bought it from him. It was \$80 for a gram so I bought two because I knew my other 2 friends would want some,  and I didn't want to do it alone. 



Just a few hours later I did my first line. There were 6 of us. All of them had used cocaine before on occasion. One of the people in our group had also purchased a gram of the same stuff earlier that day. We sat around the living room listening to music, talking and doing lines. We dumped the blow out onto a coffee table. In the little plastic baggies, it had looked like a small amount, but when poured out onto a surface, it seemed to be a lot. It was slightly rocky and crumbly. We used a razor blade to chop it down into a more fine powder, and a tightly rolled-up dollar bill to snort it. Instinctively, I used my right nostril, it felt more natural that way. I later tried using my left but the right one felt better so I pretty much stuck with that.



It went up my nose so easily, it didn't burn at all. It had an almost `menthol' quality to it, not that it smelled like mint or anything, but like vicks vapo-rub, or anything with eucalyptus, there was an `anaesthetic' feeling to it. My first line was relatively small, compared to the many more I would do later that night. It didn't hit me instantaneously, it took what seemed a few minutes and all of a sudden I was the happiest person in the world! It was a feeling of euphoria similar to the one I've had on mdma. I felt confident and talkative. Conversations were happening a mile a minute and the subject of conversation switched frequently.



The more lines I did, the better I felt! I would do 2 at a time every 30 minutes or so. About 20 minutes after doing a line, I'd feel the strong urge to do more. I would be talking to my friend and then suddenly get very bored with that conversation and start a new one with someone else. Every time I did a line, I'd get a feeling in the back of my throat similar to a post-nasal drip. There was mucus in my throat and I'd swallow it, and it tasted very acidic. Alcohol was incredibly good - I realized at one point I was drinking a glass of whisky that tasted more or less like water! 



After a couple hours we decided to head downtown. We were running late and did lines `for the road.' \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#



After that, my friend showed me a trick: he'd fill a water-bottle cap with a little bit of tepid water and snort that. This, he said, would clear your nose out and make you more high. I tried it and it didn't have much effect at all for me, although everyone else seemed to think it was a great thing to do. In the car, I realized my teeth were completely numb! At first it freaked me out a little bit but then I started to like it. I called a friend in the car, and my someone asked me, `Do you realize how fast you're talking?' Of course I didn't! 



When we got downtown, we had to walk a long way from the car, and then try to find a bunch of other people in the crowd. I had the blow in my pocket, in a pill bottle. The process of getting everyone together seemed to take forever. I went about an hour without doing a line, and that was the only time during the whole experience where I felt anxious and upset. I was agitated and focused on doing another line, while everyone else was making small talk that's all I could think about! There was definitely a glamourous aspect to the whole thing, I felt fearless and utterly cool. I felt the things I said were witty and imaginative. I lost all concern for what I looked like. I was basically wearing sweat pants, but felt like a million dollars! Once I hit that peak, though, the only way to maintain it was to do more coke. And when I couldn't envision where my next line was coming from, I felt edgy and uncomfortable for a few minutes. 



We decided to go to a bar. Once back in the car, we dipped a key in the pill bottle and snorted off that; and then just put the coke directly on the backs of our hands and did lines that way. I felt instantly better (better than even before, in fact) and had a great time in the bar. The time was going by very fast. One annoying thing was that it was very difficult to go pee! it just took forever to get it all out. Also I found I was very thirsty and drank a lot of water, and had to pee frequently. Someone ordered a sandwich in the bar, but I was dumbfounded as to how they could possibly be hungry! I was ANTI-hungry! I couldn't eat if my life depended on it. Another thing I noticed was that my jaw was very clenched up, and I kept moving my lips around and became sort of obsessed with applying chap-stick. The feeling, overall, was very similar to rolling on Ecstasy. I remember being in the bathroom in the bar and just thinking, OK a little more, and I did another line off my hand. I looked up in the mirror and there was white stuff on my nose and I just wiped it off and licked it up. It seemed hysterically funny!



When we left the bar, we decided to go back to my friends' house. I made a conscious decision to not do anymore coke for the night even though 3 of the others kept on doing lines. Instead, I smoked a bowl, I heard this helped with the comedown. About an hour after my last line, I was getting colder and colder. I mean, I was FREEZING! Similar to an ecstasy comedown. I just could not get warm no matter what.



Falling asleep was absolutely impossible. We went home around 3:30 am and I managed to sleep from about 5 AM until 8am the next day. I was very tired but just couldn't sleep at all. Eventually I got frustrated with trying to sleep, and just got up and went about my day. I crashed later on that night. The `cracked out' feeling stayed with me the whole next day. I didn't feel sad, or otherwise bad, but I still wasn't hungry, I was still clenching my jaw a little, and had a slight cold/sinus drip for a few days after that. 



I won't be buying coke again. That's because I liked it too much! This stuff is very powerful and addictive. For 3 days afterwards I thought constantly about when I would be doing it next. It's really difficult to explain, but now I understand all the things people have said about the pull of cocaine. It's unlike any other drug in that respect. I had a lot of fun that night. But I'm scared and wary of cocaine. I'm lucky to be a relatively stable, happy person right now. I could see how this drug would provide an escape for people and cause them to do things they'd ultimately regret. It would be easy to lose the ability to handle it responsibly, I feel. The craving could overtake me easily, and while it's a fun thing to do socially, I won't go seeking it out to buy. Overall, it was a very positive experience for me and one of the more memorable drugs I've tried.
