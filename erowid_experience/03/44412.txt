Well, my first experience with this drug is fairly recent I suppose\ldots  This happened about two weekends ago from today. I was at my old 8th grade teacher Mr. X's apartment when I first tried Methamphetamine. He, is a regular user of it and gets it from a well known friend/dealer for free. Usually, in small amounts about 4 or 6 lines worth. He is also a very smart man for being such a heavy user of it. When I go to his house I plan myself to talk about current politics and about the many social classes that we have in our second rate city. This is all very weird for me being such a young person (17). Well, anyways, I seem to be getting off topic just a tad. I thought I would just set the settings- the environment\ldots 



I started my first large bump or small lines worth of methamphetamine around 9:00 PM (central time). The first effects happened very rapidly. About two minutes after the first dosage I began to feel the tide. It was a very weird sensation for me. I enjoyed it very much. The first thing I felt was a very warm sensation all over my body. I began to sweat but, none of this made me paranoid. I learned that if I just understand that what I'm doing is a drug and will soon be over it tends to relieve the anxiety.. For me at least. I didn't notice my energy go up at first I just knew that I was talking a whole lot. The subject was politics. When we get like this now we call it `mental masturbation'. It was a very good environment to be doing such a powerful drug at. Modern art decor and books everywhere. Not, a depressing druggie environment at all. I felt these feelings of warmth, euphoria, and talkativeness for about 3 hours and decided that I wanted more. When I told Mr. X this he brought out to me a clean, unused, needle filled with 15 Mg's of this clear liquid of methamphetamine. At first glance I was completely opposed to the issue of using a needle to get high off of. But, I learned quickly- I become very open minded while `tweaking'. I will do just about anything that sounds someone fun or interesting.



Well, he talked me into using it in this certain manner. He seems to have this persuasive way with people. But, I swear it was just because, I was already under the influence of the drug!\ldots  The process began, heart beating fast, I began to sweat more. But, no anxiety (even though I used to be quite afraid of needles before this experience). I told him to ease up on me because, of my slight phobia and he did. He slowly entered the needle into the under part of my arm where the joint is than began to very carefully and slowly tap my vein. I saw the clear colour of the needle turn to a red from him getting a good catch of my vein and than began the process of injection. It burned at first but, I thought it wasn't as bad as hospital injections. Soon after this little epiphany I felt this quick feeling shoot from down below my knees to my brain. In almost 3 seconds I was at the plateau effects of meth. The euphoria was tense- I had a strong rushing feeling all over my body. I couldn't sit down. It was impossible. I had to talk and move. I caught myself walking from his room to where he was in the living room rubbing my stomach and laughing. When, I think I began to get on his nerves he told me that he gave me a common dose for regular users and that I was probably `over amping'. This didn't bother me.



Since he lives in the downtown part of the city I decided that walking around rubbing my stomach isn't doing the trick so I made the decision to go and walk around the streets. Mr. X followed in fear of my safety. Everything seemed so beautiful. The 100 plus story sky scrapers seemed like huge Christmas trees. I found myself feeling in such a extreme euphoria that fear was obsolete. I talked to anyone I saw on the street. Whether it was a yuppie capitalist or the ever so common victim: the infamous homeless person. I made sure that they got a nice a very memorable greeting from me. How I would approach the people seemed to make them scared. I couldn't tell you what was scaring them but, as I would approached them they seemed to try to walk away and avoid me or be very hesitant to talk to me. Which is weird because I am a scrawny, 5'2' - 5'5', 105 - 110 pound teenager. I pace walked the whole city it seems now that I look back. Mr. X trying to keep up and him telling me not to converse with the random human was a wonderful experience.



We didn't get home `till sunrise and at his house it seemed as the comedown came in minutes. One second me and him are doing our, 'mental masturbation' the next I was yawning and couldn't keep my eyes open. It was 11:00 AM before I decided it was a good time to go to bed. I slept the best I have ever. Woke up feeling very good and ready to take on the day. But, that soon faded. By the end of the day I was asked why I was so snappy and grumpy. Of course the answer was, `I don't notice you're just pissing me off!'\ldots .  I completely understand why people get addicted to the substance. I also understand why the homeless like it so much. The euphoria is so great that I could live in a box on the street and still feel great\ldots  Well, I end this. I hope you could learn something or get a feel for this drugs potency.
