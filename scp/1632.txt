SCP-1632-1 instances are usually found wrapped in white cloth, for an unknown purpose.

However, nervous and respiratory systems are not modified, allowing both partners to utilize cognitive functions and vocalize respectively. All attempts at surgical separation, even when the procedure itself is relatively harmless, have been met with failure.

Addendum: Interview Log with SCP-1632-01 instance

Interviewed: SCP-1632-1

Interviewer: Junior Researcher Winger

Junior Researcher Winger: Good evening. Could you state your names for the record?

SCP-1632-1A: Hey. The name's Randal Chasalow.

SCP-1632-1B: And my name is Diane Chasalow.

Junior Researcher Winger: Could you tell me the events that led to your current….condition?

SCP-1632-1A: As much as it pains me to say it, I wasn't a very good husband to Diane. From the late nights I spent working, to the heavy drinking later on, I should have seen our separation coming.

SCP-1632-1B: After months of arguing, I eventually moved out. I missed Randal, but being apart seemed like the best thing for the both of us.

[irrelevant information removed]

SCP-1632-1B: I saw a advertisement for a divorce lawyer in the newspaper on Tuesday1. "Need a divorce? Better ring Xing!". Heh. The rate seemed affordable enough, so I called him.

Junior Researcher Winger: How would you describe SCP-1632's services?

SCP-1632-1B: Strange names you people use around here. Anyway, Xing was really helpful with all of the legal jargon. I could tell he never approved of what he did, but money is money, I guess

SCP-1632-1A: Honey, you should probably skip to the important part.

SCP-1632-1B: Alright then. After about two weeks after all of the papers were submitted, I woke up in this strange place, in my wedding dress. It was like a chapel. But it wasn't just a chapel, it was THE chapel, you know? Like, the floor was alive and breathing. It didn't scare me, for some reason. Then, I suddenly saw Randal next to me

SCP-1632-1A: The chapel was beautiful. Nobody was seated, yet the world was watching. Gold and flowers lined the walls. I wish I could show you, it was unforgettable. Xing stood at the end of the chapel dressed in these fancy white robes. Light flooded the chapel in a color too beautiful for words.

Junior Researcher Winger: Were you not concerned about suddenly being in an unknown place?

SCP-1632-1A: No, it felt right. Everything felt right, for the first time in so long.

SCP-1632-1B: Our memory's a bit fuzzy after that, but next thing I knew, I was back in my house, together with Randal, the way it should be.

Junior Researcher Winger: Does this mean you are satisfied with your current conduction?

SCP-1632-1A: Satisfied? This is the best thing that has ever happened to me. Thank Xing for me whenever you see him.
