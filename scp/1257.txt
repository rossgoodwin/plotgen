Item #: SCP-1257

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: All copies of SCP-1257, encompassing all instances of SCP-1257-1, SCP-1257-2, and SCP-1257-3, are to be kept in the secure media vault at Site-██. Any uncontained copies of SCP-1257 are to be recovered or destroyed by MTF Mu-53 (“Ebert's Thumb”). Because of the nature of the original appearance of SCP-1257, and its widespread exposure to the public, MTF Mu-53 is also tasked to replace any new sources of information about SCP-1257 as they are discovered, in whatever format they may appear, in accordance with Protocol Gamma-1257-A (Codename: “Snopes’ Revenge”)1

Unauthorized persons exposed to copies of SCP-1257, or who evidence any knowledge about SCP-1257, shall be interrogated by the Foundation Intelligence Department, administered Class A Amnesiacs, and have implanted post-hypnotic suggestions to reinforce the belief that SCP-1257 is a hoax.2

Study of SCP-1257 is limited to personnel of Level 3 or higher, subject to approval by the Foundation Intelligence Department.

Description: SCP-1257 is an American-produced half-hour situation comedy originally titled Raising Danny that aired on the ███ television network for six episodes in 197█. Instances of SCP-1257-1 are the original production reels for all twelve episodes filmed, recovered from the ███ archives in 198█. Instances of SCP-1257-2 are the draft and shooting scripts and copies, including four episodes that were never shot. Instances of SCP-1257-3 are all other video recordings of the six episodes actually aired.

The anomalous properties of SCP-1257 manifest in any and all video copies produced from the original series, and in any copies of the scripts for those episodes. Every year, beginning in mid-September, video recordings and scripts for Raising Danny will change to reflect a new season of episodes. Replacements will begin with episode one, and progress sequentially through each episode in order during each subsequent week. While the Foundation has access to the first sixteen episodes of each season,3 it appears that each SCP-1257 season runs approximately 24 episodes. Additionally, while new seasons of SCP-1257 occasionally produce hour-long "specials,” copies are always limited to the first half-hour running time of the original episodes of SCP-1257.

Video copies of the original over-the-air broadcast of the first six episodes of SCP-1257 present a special case. Commercials recorded contemporaneously with SCP-1257 will also show changes consistent with the content of SCP-1257, and updated videos have occasionally shown news bulletins and weather alerts that imply multiple points of divergence between the world that continues to produce SCP-1257 and our own.

SCP-1257’s original premise had a black man, named Tyler (played by Whitman Mayo), married to a white woman who already had a son by a prior marriage. When the woman dies, prior to the pilot episode, the man is left raising her son, named Danny (played by Danny Bonaduce), as his own. Reviews of the original series recovered by the Foundation were universally unfavorable and referred to it as “The unwanted bastard child of Sanford and Son and The Courtship of Eddie's Father.” Because of the anomalous properties of SCP-1257, the Foundation has only been able to reconstruct a general outline of the original content of the series.

Footnotes

1. Information about SCP-1257 is replaced with new information leading to the conclusion that SCP-1257 never existed, and is a hoax. Protocol Gamma-1257-A also requires all original documentation discovered about SCP-1257 be replaced with forged copies omitting references to SCP-1257.

2. As of 5/27/19██ all original participants in the production of SCP-1257 have been found and either treated with amnesiacs or terminated.

3. Twelve via video copies (SCP-1257-1) and four only via unproduced scripts (SCP-1257-2).

4. Including Eric, despite a three-year age difference.

5. Danny has graduated college, is unemployed, and advertisements shown during SCP-1257-3 instances show that the Eric character has been spun off into his own series.

6. It is clear from the script that the title the writers intended is actually Agent Danny of the SCP Foundation. However, in the title card and in taped dialog, “Foundation” is consistently omitted. The name does appear correctly in the background sets intended to represent Foundation locations.
