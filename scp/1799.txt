SCP-1799

Item #: SCP-1799

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1799 is to be contained in a soundproofed humanoid containment cell, with the other Misters in Hall ██ of Site-██. Personnel entering SCP-1799's cell are to be fitted with a voice canceling helmet to prevent communication with the subject. Any personnel entering or leaving SCP-1799's cell are to be thoroughly searched for any potential weapon, and SCP-1799's cell is to be thoroughly inspected once every 24 hours to check for contraband.

Description: SCP-1799 is a male humanoid, approximately 1.2m tall, weighing 58kg. SCP-1799 has the physical characteristics of a generic clown. Subject is bald, skin devoid of pigmentation, a circular red nose, and elongated feet. The subject's facial pigmentation has the appearance of makeup commonly worn by circus performers. The words "Mr. Laugh, from Little Misters ® by Dr. Wondertainment" are tattooed upon SCP-1799's lower back. This designation appears as "3" in Document SCP-909-a.

Anything that SCP-1799 says to a person will be interpreted by that person as a joke. The longer the subject speaks to the person, the funnier the "jokes" will become, until the subject is overcome by laughter. Due to this fact, it is extremely difficult to communicate with SCP-1799. The only known way to communicate with the subject is through written word, as this does not activate the effect. In addition, SCP-1799 is able to perform several anomalous actions. SCP-1799 has no control over these abilities, and they appear to be involuntary, painful, and random. They are usually similar to actions that would be performed by circus performers who were using props, including:

Removal and reattachment of limbs.

Squirting water out of a flower attached to its chest cavity.

Pulling a string of colored cloth out of its mouth, with the longest string measuring 45.2m.

Extruding colored smoke from several orifices.

Dr.B███: Please state your name.

SCP-1799: Sure. They call me… Mr. Laugh.

Dr.B███: [Continues to laugh] Man, you are a riot!

ADDENDUM 1799-A: During an experiment on ██/██/20██, SCP-1799 began yelling at D-9023. The subject began laughing incessantly, and, in his distracted state, tripped and suffered a severe head injury, which proved to be fatal. SCP-1799 became noticeably withdrawn and sullen following the event, leading to SCP-1799's first suicide attempt. As of ██/██/20██, SCP-1799 has been put on suicide watch.

ADDENDUM 1799-B: This note was found on SCP-1799's person during initial containment.
