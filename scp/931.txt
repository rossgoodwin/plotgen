A Description of

SCP Nine Thirty-One:

It is a rice bowl.

White, with a blue band,

And a crackled blue pattern

All inside the bowl.

Three inches in height,

Four point five inches across.

(Metric doesn’t fit.)

No makers’ marks found;

Suspected to have been made

Late Nineteen Hundreds.

When viewed or handled,

The item causes people

To write in haiku.

(Not the classic sense:

Themes of nature aren’t needed,

Just Five-Seven-Five.)

Speech remains unchanged,

But trying to write or type

Ends up as haiku.

Exposure effects

Wear off within a few hours

(Varies by subject).

Anything written

About it— also haiku,

Even if absent.

If written by one

Ignorant of its effect,

They’re still affected.

Its effect appears

To be memetic in source—

Though not yet proven.

Evidence for this?

Those exposed who know haiku

Write “proper” haiku.

Most people exposed,

Who don’t know these requirements,

Just know the structure.
