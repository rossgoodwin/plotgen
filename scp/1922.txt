Item# SCP-1922

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1922 is housed in a standard human containment cell on Site-17. The subject is to remain under monitoring by security personnel. Self-harmful behavior or changes in the subject's health are to be reported to Doctors Dharow and/or Ipps-Hill. Psychiatric evaluations with interviews are administered by Dr. Dharow and health inspections by Dr. Ipps-Hill. Said procedures are performed on a monthly basis; and after the occurrence of anomalous activity. SCP-1922 is not allowed to possess items of combustible nature and is to be supervised to prevent contact with such when outside the cell.

Description: SCP-1922 is a ninety-year-old Caucasian male named Herbert ████. SCP-1922 is diagnosed with Diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral vascular disease. Subject's medical condition with the effect of the anomaly have caused several episodes of gangrene in the lower limbs, which have led to amputations. For a full list of medical details on SCP-1922, please see Document 1922-Med.

SCP-1922 behaves as a normal elderly human until expiring from a natural cause, myocardial infarction being the most common probable cause of death. SCP-1922 remains in a state of clinical death for approximately 45 minutes, after which it slowly reanimates. Full recovery may take up to 2 hours. After reanimation the subject is slightly disoriented, but the periods of clinical death have not been shown to cause any neurological damage. IQ testing has proven no deterioration and SCP-1922 appears mentally healthy and intelligent. Compared to subject's advanced age, the level of intellect is well maintained. The subject describes experiences in elaborate detail, supposedly taking place during the anomalous activity. Currently no evidence exists nor may be provided to support the subject's claims. Whether the anomaly induces vivid hallucinations or SCP-1922 deliberately produces misinformation is unknown. For more details, please see Document 1922-Psy and the Interview Log.

Note: 2005-07-03: It has been recorded that the time SCP-1922 remains clinically deceased extends after each subsequent expiry. The reanimation process, nevertheless, takes subsequently less time.

Note: 2008-05-05: SCP-1922 has started to show suicidal tendencies.

Recovery: SCP-1922 was recovered from █████ Hospital in █████, ███████ on 1997-06-06. Specialized doctors were alerted when a man had regained consciousness in the hospital morgue, almost an hour after having been declared deceased. The subject was taken into custody of the Foundation and the subject's family was later provided with substitute ashes. Class-C Amnesiacs administered to hospital staff in charge of the subject. SCP-1922 was led to believe he was being moved to different hospital with better faculties.

<Begin Log>

Dr. Dharow: Alright, Herbert? Feeling better?

SCP-1922: Does my family know I'm here, doctor? Have you told them?

Dr. Dharow: Uh, well… Herbert…

SCP-1922: I'll take that as a no, then. I might be old, doctor, but I'm not stupid, you know. That's good. That's good, right? I mean, they mourn me already, don't they?

Dr. Dharow: I really wouldn't know.

SCP-1922: Of course, doctor. I just… I just don't want to put them through this again. They'll be better off without, won't they? This wasn't the first time, doctor, you know. It's happened before. At home. But I was all by myself, then. First I thought I had slept. But it wasn't all right, you know. I guess you caught me this time, didn't you? [Subject laughs] An old man, cheating death.

Dr. Dharow: How does it happen, then? Cheating death.

SCP-1922: I don't know. You tell me. You're the doctor here, doctor. I just wake up.

Dr. Dharow: Can you tell me what does happen? Can you describe it to me?

SCP-1922: I really don't know, there's nothing I can tell you. Can you just please not tell my family? Just promise you'll keep them out of this.

Dr. Dharow: I'm sorry about your foot, Herbert.

SCP-1922: Yes, yes. Seems to go on like this. I'm not really going anywhere am I?

Dr. Dharow: What can you tell me about your experience this time?

SCP-1922: It's awful. It really is. I wish I couldn't remember, doctor. I wish I'd forget, like I used to. It's just too much.

Dr. Dharow: Tell me.

SCP-1922: Hell, it's like a waiting room. That horrible feeling of anticipation. The pressure.

Dr. Dharow: Hell? Do you mean it's hell you think you go to?

SCP-1922: Not in the way you'd think. Certainly feels like hell, but that's not it.

Dr. Dharow: What else?

SCP-1922: The usual. It's not changing, doctor. Okay? I'll tell you if it does, you don't have to ask me every time, you know? All the pieces… Sorry, doctor, I feel really nauseous right now, can we stop for a minute?

Addendum 1922-3: Psychological Evaluation:

Document 1922-Psy

[Excerpt]

Even after years of interrogations [discontinued 1998-02-08] and ongoing interviews, SCP-1922 is reluctant to provide information on the means of acquired prolonged lifespan. SCP-1922 is considered to be completely aware of the process behind the reanimation, but refuses to cooperate. No crucial information has been obtained from the subject, and as medical examinations and testing have proved inconclusive, the means to the subject's ability to reanimate remains currently unknown. SCP-1922 has become increasingly suicidal and even less compliant, making the monthly interviews unavailing.

As medical examinations show [refer to Document 1922-Med], SCP-1922 in the state of clinical death shows no brain activity. However, after reanimation the subject has been able to describe experiences that have supposedly occurred during the period. It has not been determined if the subject is actually capable of such experiences or if the descriptions of such are merely intended to mislead the researchers. SCP-1922 claims that during death, it (or its consciousness) is transferred to an undisclosed locus. According to the subject this locus is occupied by what appear to be parts of the human body, mainly hair and limbs. SCP-1922 has also occasionally described skin, organs and teeth. The subject reports feelings of dread and nausea, and often refuses to discuss these visions. This behavior led to the dismissed theory that SCP-1922 is able to dream while being clinically deceased. The absence of any brain activity indicates otherwise. SCP-1922 believes its own body to be responsible for the transfer and the only way to "escape" this condition is to be cremated. Subject's concerns are to be disregarded.
