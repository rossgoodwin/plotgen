Item #: SCP-1239

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Site-███ has been established around SCP-1239-2. When not in use for testing, SCP-1239-1 and removable instances of SCP-1239-3 are to be kept outside of SCP-1239-2 in dedicated storage lockers to prevent accidental activation. SCP-1239-2 should be soundproofed, with all windows obscured from the outside.

Description: SCP-1239 consists of 3 (three) components:

SCP-1239-1, a lamp with a standard low voltage power cable, containing artificial flora with 4 (four) flower-like lightbulbs. The words “Hey Kids!” are engraved on the lid.

SCP-1239-2, a residence in ██████████, ███████.

SCP-1239-3, a specific set of objects present within SCP-1239-2 at time of recovery.

The anomalous effects of SCP-1239 manifest if SCP-1239-1 is powered and viewed by a post-pubescent human subject while both are within SCP-1239-2. Following this, the subject will experience a series of conditional hallucinations until exiting SCP-1239-2, as follows:

Subjects will perceive samples of SCP-1239-3 to be different objects. This is apparently consistent between subjects, as all subjects tested have perceived respective SCP-1239 samples in the same way.1 Objects present within SCP-1239-2 other than SCP-1239-3 will be perceived normally by affected subjects.

Subjects will perceive any prepubescent or pubescent individuals present within SCP-1239-2 as highly amiable, despite the subjects' prior dispositions or relationship with children, and will express a desire to engage in play activities.

Subjects will perceive all expressions of discomfort, pain or displeasure produced by pre-pubescent and pubescent individuals within SCP-1239-2 as expressions of pleasure or enjoyment.

Upon exiting SCP-1239, the hallucinatory symptoms caused by exposure to SCP-1239-1 will cease, and are removed retroactively (i. e., the subject will remember observing SCP-1239-3 samples as they would normally appear, and will be unable to recall experiencing the hallucinations previously caused by SCP-1239). Behaviour caused by SCP-1239, however, will be recalled with an expected degree of detail. As a result of this, subjects are able to recall actions made under the influence of SCP-1239, but are unable to recall the motivation for said actions.

Summarised Recovery Log: SCP-1239 was first identified shortly after an incident occurring in SCP-1239-2 on ████-07-██, in which the respective parents of 10 (ten) children, who had agreed to meet as part of a social event, were exposed to SCP-1239-1. The affected individuals (of which there were 6 (six)) were interviewed and dealt with as per Recovery Protocol 8. A cover story regarding a toxic gas leak was later circulated, and the remains of the children incinerated after analysis.

Note: Testing regarding SCP-1239 has determined that no direct or compulsive behavioural alterations result from exposure to SCP-1239-1.
